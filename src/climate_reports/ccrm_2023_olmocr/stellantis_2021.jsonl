We took brave, forward-looking actions to spark additional growth, beginning the process of building an innovative ecosystem with leading partners.\n\nAnd thanks to the incredible resilience and passion of our people \u2013 the 300,000 women and men of Stellantis, representing 170 nationalities across 130 countries \u2013 I can say with confidence that we have emerged even stronger from this challenging first year.\n\nThroughout, our leadership team has remained focused on our operations and continued to invest in technology, innovative thinking and quality right across our Company.\n\nOur strategy is clear: offering the very best products to our customers while shaping a 21st century organization that while maintaining the focus on our success in the market strives just as hard to protect and enhance our communities and our planet.\n\nAs we now move into our second year, we hit the road with confidence, conscious that the future will be shaped by the clarity and courage of our choices.\n\nAnd as we do, my thanks go to you dear shareholders for your continuing and precious support.\n\nFebruary 25, 2022\n\n/s/\n\nJohn Elkann.\nChairman\nMESSAGE FROM THE CEO\n\nThis annual report begins with a \u201cthank you.\u201d It has been an exceptionally challenging year for everyone at Stellantis. Yet despite all the disruption that the pandemic has taken on us, in 2021 we have built our foundation and set the course for our transformation into a sustainable mobility tech company.\n\nPowered by our diversity, we\u2019ve stayed true to our purpose of providing customers with sustainable and affordable solutions that will change the way the world moves. We have done so alongside all the demands of these difficult 12 months, while achieving record financial results.\n\nWe delivered Pro Forma Net revenues of \u20ac152 billion, which is up 14%. We registered a Pro Forma Adjusted operating income that nearly doubled to \u20ac18 billion with a 11.8% margin, all segments profitable, and a Pro Forma Net profit from continuing operations of \u20ac13.4 billion, which is nearly tripled year-on-year.\n\nEveryone involved, in each part of the business, deserves my gratitude.\n\nBuilding a financially sound Company is a significant milestone along our journey. It\u2019s not the only one though.\n\nIn 2021, we defined our Purpose and Values, pledging to care for the planet, our employees and the communities in which we operate. We planned investments of more than \u20ac30 billion through 2025 to execute our electrification and software strategies, launching in the meantime more than 10 new products. We built partnerships with game-changing partners to drive top-line growth in the coming years.\n\nThese actions give us the platform to go on with our transformation of the business, following an ambitious strategy that will drive sustainable growth and ensure the future of Stellantis.\n\nWe will continue to build on the quality of our products and services, relying on the global strength of our brands.\n\nWe will keep championing progress, competing with tech players on software and services, offer new and more integrated technology-led solutions to our customers, and to create value for all our stakeholders.\n\nWe will continue to learn, adapt, and execute, as the next phase of the journey will not be any easier.\n\nDuring the last year, we relied on an unbreakable team spirit.\n\nI would like to thank every colleague across all the regions, brands and functions for their extraordinary efforts. The customer-centric mindset and the capacity to be agile and innovative are reflected in our strong performance.\n\nFinally, I am grateful to our shareholders for supporting Stellantis through this challenging first year.\n\nA bright future is ahead of us. We will shape it together.\n\nFebruary 25, 2022\n\n/s/\n\nCarlos Tavares\nChief Executive Officer\nBUSINESS MODEL AND GOVERNANCE: CREATING SHARED AND LASTING VALUE\n\n1.1 VALUE CREATION MODEL\n\n1.1.1 Business Model 5\n1.1.2 Key Figures 8\n1.1.3 Stakeholder dialogue for a better mutual understanding with society 9\n1.1.4 Shared value for stakeholders and contribution to SDGs 12\n\n1.2 MATERIAL CSR RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES INHERENT TO THE VALUE CREATION MODEL 23\n\n1.2.1 CSR macro-risks and related CSR issues: Stellantis CSR pillars and challenges 23\n1.2.2 Stellantis materiality matrix: relative position of the 22 CSR challenges 24\n1.2.3 Extensive assessment of risks 26\n1.2.4 CSR trajectory 27\n\n1.3 CSR GOVERNANCE 30\n\n1.3.1 CSR policy 30\n1.3.2 CSR in the Board of Directors 31\n1.3.3 CSR embedded into business: at the Executive and Operational levels 31\n1.1 VALUE CREATION MODEL\n\n1.1.1 BUSINESS MODEL\n\nA Leader for a New Era of Mobility\n\nStellantis N.V was formed on the basis of a cross-border merger between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Groupe PSA, and approved by the shareholders of the former two companies on January 4, 2021.\n\nStellantis is a leading global mobility player guided by a clear mission: to provide freedom of movement for all through distinctive, appealing, affordable and sustainable mobility solutions.\n\nOur multinational automotive manufacturing Company is headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and is comprised of two hundred-year-old groups, establishing a leading automotive mobility provider in a context of deep industrial transformation.\n\nStellantis is listed on Milan\u2019s Borsa Italiana, on Euronext Paris and on the New York Stock Exchange.

Our electrification and software strategies will support the shift to become a sustainable mobility tech company, leveraging the associated business growth with over-the-air features and services, and working to deliver the best experience to our customers.\n\nStellantis has operations in 37 countries around the world and a commercial presence in 130 markets which is a strong asset for understanding and anticipating the upcoming changes of customer expectations while creating value for all stakeholders.

By 2026, this is expected to grow to 26 million vehicles and generate approximately \u20ac4 billion in revenues. By 2030, it is expected to reach 34 million vehicles and approximately \u20ac20 billion in annual revenues.\n\nThrough software and on-demand features, Stellantis will work to provide customers with the ability to tailor their vehicles to individual needs and desires through over-the-air updates, further increasing the unique qualities of the varied brands within Stellantis and strengthening the bond between the vehicle and driver.\n\nIn 2021, Stellantis has delivered more than six million over-the-air updates to its vehicles and intends to offer at least quarterly releases by 2026.\nA LEADER FOR NEW ERA MOBILITY\n\nINPUTS\nCAPITAL\n\n> FINANCIAL\nCapacity to finance the economic development, either in-house or from financial markets.\n\n> INDUSTRIAL\nManufacturing resources available for production, research and development, logistics\n\n> INTELLECTUAL\nIntangible assets such as intellectual property and organizational capital.\n\n> RELATIONAL\nStakeholder relations: ability to share information; brands and reputation.\n\n> HUMAN\nMotivation of employees to be innovative and adherence to governance principles, risk management methods and ethical values of the Company.\n\n> ENVIRONMENTAL\nRenewable and nonrenewable environmental processes and resources.\n\nOPERATING\nACTIVITIES\n\nOUTPUTS\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nBroad portfolio of iconic and complementary automotive brands and mobility services, to cover all key segments: AN OFFER FOR EVERY CUSTOMER!\n\nGlobal SUV\n\nAmerican brands\n\nUpper mainstream\n\nCore\n\nPremium\n\nLuxury\n\nMobility\n\nOUTPUTS\nVALUE CREATION FOR STAKEHOLDERS\n\n> INVESTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS\n\n> CUSTOMERS\n\n> EMPLOYEES\n\n> SUPPLIERS AND PARTNERS\n\n> HOST COMMUNITIES AND CIVIL SOCIETY\n\n> LIFE-FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT\n\nFor more information see 1.1.4\nTo increase the positive impacts and reduce the negative consequences of our activities throughout the value chain, Stellantis takes specific actions that are designed to maintain or develop the Company\u2019s environmental, relational, financial, human, industrial and intellectual capital.\n\nThese efforts result in the value that the Company shares with its stakeholders.

It includes the following targets:\n\n- **an electric product offensive** supported by plans to invest more than \u20ac30 billion through 2025 in electrification and software development, including equity investments made in joint ventures to fund their activities, while targeting to continue to be 30 percent more efficient than the industry with respect to total Capex and research and development spend versus revenues. Stellantis will notably utilize three different Electric Drive Modules adaptable to all our platforms, covering all vehicles worldwide and sharing a high level of commonality, in order to optimize the overall cost efficiency by reducing complexity, eliminating duplications and improving development efficiency. Each of our four platforms will be designed to allow the production of up to two million units units per year. This will guarantee a critical size for optimized investments and competitive unit cost. This is a key success factor for our value optimization. Stellantis announced on July 8, 2021 it will target over 70% of sales in Europe and over 40% in the United States to be low emission vehicles (LEVs) by 2030. To support this ambition, the Company will work to develop a global EV battery sourcing strategy of over 260GWh by 2030, with up to five \u201cgigafactories\u201d between Europe and North America. Battery packs will be tailored for a variety of vehicles \u2013 from smaller city cars to energy-dense packs for performance vehicles and trucks. The plan also includes the use of two battery chemistries by 2024 to support various customer needs: a high energy-density option and a nickel cobalt-free alternative. By 2026, the first competitive solid state battery technology is targeted to be introduced;\n\n- **the execution of the synergy opportunities** arising from the formation of Stellantis, with a forecast of annual cash synergies of more than \u20ac5 billion at steady state, the roadmap of battery cost reductions, and the continued optimization of distribution and production costs and realization of new revenue streams, in particular from connected services and future software business models;\n\n- **the vertical integration** from the pack down to the cell design to get all the benefits from the chemistry active materials that are so useful and precious. Our partnership with Total Saft, the joint venture (JV) Automotive Cell Company (ACC), and sustainable businesses with the most competitive cell suppliers are expected to allow us to save more than 40% cost in 2024 vs. 2020 at module level through: module simplification, cell size increase, chemistry upgrade;\n\n- **the development of offers and services in response to the new mobility needs** of customers, in areas such as used vehicles, leasing, aftersales service and shared mobility;\n\n- **a software strategy** to deploy next-generation tech platforms, building on existing connected vehicle capabilities to transform how customers interact with their vehicles, aiming to generate approximately \u20ac20 billion in incremental annual revenue by 2030. A non-binding memorandum of understanding signed with Foxconn aimed at designing a family of purpose-built micro-controllers. Stellantis also continues its dedicated projects with Waymo. As Chrysler Pacifica Hybrids equipped with the Waymo Driver provide thousands of fully autonomous rides in Phoenix, Arizona (U.S.), Stellantis and Waymo have now expanded their partnership to local delivery services. Engineering teams will get their hands on Stellantis prototypes in 2022;\n\n- **the ability to forge partnerships with responsible and innovative companies** (notably startups), committed to tackling climate change, as they are backed by investors who support initiatives for a low-carbon economy;\n\n- **an internal audit and risk management which includes ESG** (environmental, social and governance) risks, so as to reduce uncertainty in the long-term and capitalize on opportunities;\n\n- **a robust compliance and ethics system**, based on the Stellantis Code of Conduct, which strives to ensure the effectiveness of compliance programs in essential areas such as competition, anti-corruption, export control, data privacy and type approval. The system is incorporated into the day-to-day working environment by a network of trained officers responsible for implementing these programs and monitoring their application. Guided by the Company\u2019s Code of Conduct, this system fosters a culture of integrity within Stellantis and is intended to prevent ethical abuses liable to damage our financial position and reputation.\nStellantis long-term performance is also based on a performance shared among all stakeholders through:\n\n- **transparent and effective decision-making processes**: to deploy its strategic plans over the long-term, Stellantis opted for a governance structure based on a Board of Directors\u2019 which is responsible for the management and strategic direction of the Company and a Top Executive Team to drive all implementation plans;\n\n- **taking into account the interests of stakeholders in strategic or operational decisions**: an ESG Committee at Board level is in charge of monitoring, evaluation and reporting on the sustainable policies and practices, CSR strategy and CSR performance. In addition, responsibility is exercised within all management or executive functions within the Company. Making CSR central to decisions and actions can boost performance, allow our Company to improve its economic and financial efficiency (reducing costs, driving innovation, creating new revenue streams, etc.), safeguard the value of its assets, manage risks more effectively \u2013 whether they are environmental, legal, financial, social or reputational \u2013 and protect its value and sustainability in the medium to long-term;\n\n- **a compensation policy** for corporate officers and members of the Top Executive Team based on performance and a long-term view of the Company, was approved by the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting;\n\n- **the protection of shareholders\u2019 rights**, including the views of minority shareholders. Shareholders who meet the legal and regulatory requirements may apply to have specific items added to the agenda of the Shareholders meeting by submitting them to the Company\u2019s registered office, as described in the Notice of Meeting. Electronic online voting is in place in accordance with French, Italian and U.S. regulations and practices;\n\n- **fair access to information to allow informed decision-making**: Stellantis exercises its responsibility towards its investors and shareholders aims to provide them with access to key information so they can make fully-informed decisions. Firstly, the fairness of the financial and CSR related data published is certified by third-party auditors. Secondly, Stellantis works to be fair and transparent in providing to all relevant parties with the strategic plan, financial data and CSR commitments and performance, which are intended to show that the long-term risks have been properly considered. In addition, Stellantis implements SASB Transportation standard and commits to implement the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures;\n\n- **targeting a sustainable double-digit Adjusted Operating Income margins** in the mid-term (~2026).\n\n### 1.1.4.2 Value created for customers\n\nStellantis CSR policy makes customers central to the Company\u2019s processes, offering them:\n\n**A personalized customer/brand relationship**\n\nWith a portfolio covering all market segments from luxury premium to mainstream and commercial vehicles, Stellantis brands define actions to provide a unique experience for their customers, based on:\n\n| Adrenaline in every ride | Versatility for life\u2019s extraordinary journeys |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Best-in-class performance, pure Italian style and sporting legacy | Elegance and temperament |\n| Perfect adherence to modern and innovative lifestyles | Italian Audacity |\n| Innovation, efficiency and functionality | Approachability of research and development precision and connected innovations |\n| Avant-garde spirit and French luxury savoir faire | \u201cFull motion\u201d with a complete mobility offering (cars, scooters, bikes) |\n| Domestic. Not Domesticated | Hardworking products, infusing them with great looks, refined interiors |\n| Inclusiveness in a cool, affordable way with optimistic energy | Great design and ingenious technology |\n\nStellantis&You, retail network owned by Stellantis, won the \u201cUser Experience\u201d Grand Prix of Auto-Info magazine in France in December 2021.\n\n---\n\n1 Board members are selected for their complementary experience and skills, particularly in risk assessment and CSR (for more details, refer to the Stellantis Annual Report).\nEasy and shared mobility through global mobility brands for both B2B and B2C\n\nMobility transformation is driven by three key trends: electrification of vehicles and alternative powertrains, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS). With its Free2Move and Leasys brands, Stellantis offers mobility services to facilitate customer mobility, both for end customers and corporate customers:\n\n- **agility for all users**: Free2move, a mobility tech brand, offers a complete and unique ecosystem for its private and professional customers around the world and specifically in Europe and the U.S.: services are digital and designed to satisfy the needs of each user in large urban centers. The Free2move Mobility Hubs allow users to choose the best mode of transportation, depending on their travel need: car sharing, rental by the minute or up to several months, car with drivers (VTC ride), parking space etc. Free2move has been awarded by Frost & Sullivan as 2021 OEM New Mobility Marketplace Company of the Year, with the platform that enables operators to give end customers a fully integrated experience and freedom to access all transportation modes from a single platform;\n\n- **easy transition to electric mobility**: in addition, to provide a response to its customers in the transition to the use of electric vehicles, Free2move has also developed a range of solutions to remove the main obstacles and support individuals and professionals towards electric mobility (i.e., Charge My Car, All-e and future developments around fast charging and V2G). Solutions that provide end-to-end charging and energy solutions such as 360o charging solutions to simplify private, business and fleet customers charging experience, day-to-day smart charging offers with green energy, and launching a unique fast charging network enabled by renewables, energy storage and 100% grid integrated. Free2Move eSolutions in taking part in this EV fast charging network;\n\n- **simplicity and inclusiveness**: mobility solutions from one minute to a lifetime are offered by Leasys, together with a broad range of services addressing the specific needs of BtoC and BtoB customers. These inclusive solutions make mobility available through subscription programs such as FlexRent, LeasysGo!, the electric car sharing offer and CarCloud which enables access to a multitude of vehicles, including unlimited changes of vehicles from any Leasys Mobility Store within a country. These innovative solutions add to the comprehensive range of short-medium-long term rental products and services that have made Leasys the leader of the Italian long-term-rental market. Leasys\u2019 product development has been awarded the coveted \u201cProduct of the Year\u201d award for the last three consecutive years in the Automotive Services (Italy) category. This award, in its 16th edition, was based on the vote of 12,000 Italian consumers who voted, through an online survey carried out by IRI.\n\nTraveling in vehicles designed to meet quality and safety standards\n\nStellantis products are designed to meet customers\u2019 requirements on quality and safety, which cannot be addressed separately given the long lifespan of vehicles:\n\n- **long-lasting quality**: reliability, durability, ability to repair (availability of spare parts), comfort and preserved aspect are major criteria closely monitored in the development process of any new vehicle;\n\n- **safety for all**: Stellantis strives to protect the safety of each individual road user. The focus is on technologies with a proven ability to make vehicles safer including intrusion prevention and cyber security threats at an affordable cost for the largest number of users. Safety devices prevent accidents, protect people in the event of an accident, alert the emergency services and provide assistance. The acceleration of autonomous vehicle and connected technologies will contribute offering increasing levels of safety, through:\n  - technology that allows users to stay permanently connected while on the move;\n  - continued deployment of driving assistance systems (ADAS) foreshadowing the autonomous vehicle.\n\nA Fair Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), based on sustainability and responsibility\n\n- **a TCO** of electric mobility progressively aligned with ICE mobility and supported by Stellantis software strategy: the heart of the transformation to customer-centric services is the new electrical/electronic (E/E) and software architecture (named STLA Brain) which will breaks today\u2019s bond between hardware and software generations, enabling software developers to create and update features and services quickly without waiting for a new hardware. These over-the-air updates dramatically reduce costs for both the customers, simplify maintenance for the user and sustain vehicle residual values;\nAffordable maintenance with spare parts for all budgets in a circular economy mindset: for customers with older vehicles of all brands, Stellantis offers a service which is based on the Eurorepar range and equipment manufacturer parts. In addition to offering a full range of remanufactured original parts, Stellantis also offers multi-brand re-used parts and a \u201crepair and return\u201d service for automatic gearboxes and complex electronic components. The total range covers close to 60% of vehicle content and allows cost savings for customers up to 40% compared to equivalent original parts. Mopar, Eurorepar, BproAuto, and B\u00f6lk brands cover every need. This range allows Stellantis to meet the needs of all of customers regardless of budget. Stellantis replacement parts are available for all markets:\n\n- Reinsurance: Stellantis original parts;\n- Smart buy: Eurorepar parts, Suppliers\u2019 parts, Remanufactured and \u201crepaired and returned\u201d Stellantis original parts;\n- Best costs: Reused parts, B\u00f6lk parts.\n\nA responsible approach to maintenance with spare parts verified to boost safety: Due to their strong visual resemblance to branded parts, customers might be misled by counterfeit parts. A poor quality of counterfeit parts can endanger consumer safety. In the automotive field in particular, counterfeit products do not offer guarantees in terms of safety, environmental protection or regulatory requirements. In order to allow customers, after-market and customs networks to authenticate genuine parts, the various brands of Stellantis use a secure label placed on replacement parts packaging.\n\nAssurance for business clients eager to highlight their own commitment to responsible purchasing\n\nEcoVadis, an independent rating agency that specializes in responsible purchasing, has annually recognized former Groupe PSA and FCA brands as performing responsible suppliers. PSA brands even reached a score of 83/100, and were awarded a Platinum medal for their rank in the top 1% of companies in their industry. Stellantis business clients can therefore demonstrate their own commitment to responsible purchasing.\n\nOver the next 3 years we intend to expand our electrification plan for commercial vehicles across all products and all Regions, notably based on an already 100% electrified van range in Europe, and first fuel cell van.\n\nAbility to engage in electric mobility with affordable and desirable mobility devices combined with useful and versatile services\n\n- A full portfolio of products and services able to tackle 360\u00b0 customer needs in the journey of electro-mobility. We have adopted an uncompromised customer centric approach also in the development of electric offer, which will allow us to meet our customers\u2019 expectations at the best level of performance. Our 4 BEV-by-design platforms will bring solutions to what matters most to our customers in the era of electric mobility: range, charging time, price and product variety.\n- All our 14 brands are committed to offering best-in-class fully electrified solutions, delivering BEVs that meet demands of customers, with ranges of 500-800 km/300-500 miles and class-leading fast charging capability of 32 km/20 miles per minute.\n- Customer\u2019s first concern is the charging: in partnership with partners, energy suppliers and investors, we will develop a unique Fast Charging Network, to offer the best charging experience to our customers. We will also offer \u00abpeace of mind\u00bb solutions with Smart Charging Packages (\u00abAll e\u00bb). Our ambition is to provide the best customers experience, whether for private or public charging, for both B2C and B2B usages.\n- Our 4 BEV-by-design platforms provide affordability to all with the most efficient common toolbox and systems: 3 core electric drive module families to ensure efficiency, modularity and performances, and 2 battery cell chemistries (Nickel and Cobalt free offering a low and stable cost 20% lower than the Ni based) which, will, by design, be able to be upgraded depending on our customer needs: cost reduction, energy density improvement, or charging speed increase.\n\nEV mobility is also about integration in the new ecosystem. Customers will benefit from our consumer electronics and mobile internet capabilities in the cockpit and remotely (IV in software with Foxconn). Our increased level of control over software development will allow us to update software over-the-air on our vehicles to continuously improve the customer experience, based on our active 12 million connected vehicles. Stellantis announced on its Software Day on December 7, 2021, that three all-new AI-powered technology platforms would be deployed at scale, starting in 2024: STLA Brain, STLA SmartCockpit, and STLA AutoDrive. This transformation will move Stellantis\u2019 vehicles from today\u2019s dedicated electronic architectures to an open software-defined platform that seamlessly integrates\nwith customers\u2019 digital lives. It greatly expands the options customers have to add innovative features and services via regular over-the-air (OTA) updates keeping vehicles fresh, exciting and updated years after they have been built. Stellantis expects 34 million monetizable connected cars by 2030, with a majority of all new vehicles to be fully over-the-air updatable by 2024.\n\n- Providing disruptive solutions to the new urban usage of mobility is also a key mission vis-\u00e0-vis our customers. Citro\u00ebn Ami launched in 2020, Opel E-Rocks launched in 2021 are designed for sustainable urban mobility. They are ultra-compact individual mobility solutions with 2 seats, accessible over the age of 14 / 15 (according to countries) through highly competitive \u00e0 la carte offers.\n\n1.1.4.3 Value created for employees\n\nStellantis has adopted a business strategy based on a profitable and sustainable growth plan. In order to capitalize on all development opportunities, Stellantis employees are major players in the strategic plan. Together with employee representatives and the unions, the Company is fostering a diverse culture, in which all join forces to build the future, and where teams can compete to demonstrate and develop their talent. Our human resources policy allows our employees to:\n\nDevelop in a culture where solutions are designed collaboratively\n\nThe co-construction approach shared by Stellantis and the employee representatives contributes to the Company\u2019s performance and protects employees. It favors preparation of the organizations to face upcoming massive changes due to the electrification and software pathways the automotive sector is now taking.\n\nIt also favors very reactive adaptation to brutal changes as the COVID-19 pandemic: remote work and short-work according to the type of jobs have been implemented in few days.\n\nTake ownership of their career by developing their skills and prepare for the future\n\nStellantis jobs prospective observatory allows the identification of skills necessary to support the Company\u2019s strategy. Employees are informed of the potential changes which might impact their job position and can prepare, through training, for upskilling or change career path.\n\nStellantis has set up governance for its Job Families and professions to protect its know-how and expertise and develop its talents across the Company supporting performance as a basis for equality of opportunity.\n\nPersonal Development Plans provide staff members with the opportunity to boost and diversify their skills, including training with a wide range of teaching materials in addition to professional mobility, with priority given to internal mobility. Stellantis electrification strategy impacts job positions within the Company but also opens new opportunities in the e-mobility ecosystem in a broad approach supported by strategic vertical integration.\n\nTo support this transformation, Stellantis is creating a software and data academy to retrain more than 1,000 internal engineers in multiple roles and develop its software community. The Company is also hiring top software and AI talent from technology and other industries globally. By 2024, Stellantis targets having 4,500 efficiency-driven software engineers, creating talent hubs around the globe. Those engineers are expected to perform the execution of Stellantis\u2019 software ambitions and operate within the ecosystem created by Stellantis partnerships.\n\nEmployees who wish to become \u201cintrapreneurs\u201d are trained in methods proven by startups, starting by interviewing potential users to better define the value proposition. Prototype in hand, they conduct tests with future customers while developing the associated compensation model. Whatever the outcome, the idea submitters live for three months the exciting adventure of intrapreneurship, guided by an attentive and benevolent internal coach. In addition, Incub\u2019s basics, a COOC (corporate online open course) has been created and is available for all Company employees. This online training allows Company employees to get used to lean startup methods and innovative ecosystems more quickly.\n\n55% of employees who have had an annual appraisal\n\n202,437 employees have completed at least one training course during the year\nWork in an environment that promotes health, well-being and flexible work life balance\n\nStellantis strives to be one of the industry leaders in workplace health and safety. For Stellantis, developing and attracting talent means rethinking the workplace relationship due to the possibilities created by new technologies. Remote working helps to ensure a work/life balance and improves working conditions. In continuity with the working from home policy, Stellantis has presented the \u201cNew Era of Agility\u201d program to massively develop remote working. Stellantis works to be innovative as regards remote work. For all applicable jobs, up to 70% of work from home is proposed to employees, allowing them to reallocate commuting time to sports, culture, self-education, family time... and even to relocate their homes.\n\nShowcase their talents in an inclusive environment where diversity is an asset\n\nCommitted to strengthening diversity and inclusion, Stellantis became a signatory to the UN Women\u2019s Empowerment Principles (UN Women) and reinforces its commitment to adopt measures aimed at promoting gender equality and female empowerment in the workplace. The adhesion is part of the Company\u2019s Diversity and Inclusion plan, which promotes affirmative actions that strengthen the development of its professionals and the occupation of leadership positions in the Company.\n\nOn an international scale, the Collective Bargaining Agreements on Social Responsibility are committed to exceeding local legal requirements in applying and promoting the fight against racism, sexism, xenophobia and homophobia and, more generally, against intolerance of differences and ensuring respect for privacy.\n\nStellantis promotes diversity and inclusion and actively combats discrimination in its recruitment, talent management and compensation policy:\n\n- the gender equality policy is enforced worldwide and monitored with a female/male wage ratio. In 2021, it was 0.94 for blue collars and 0.91 for white collars;\n- the \u201cyouth employment\u201d policy seeks to integrate apprentices and trainees on work-study placements across all regions and business areas. (4,013 youths trained within Stellantis in the year as apprentices or interns). Choose my company rewarded Stellantis for its commitment to its interns and apprentices by awarding Stellantis its Happy Trainees 2022 label in France. The ranking, based on the HappyIndex\u00aeTrainees method, highlights companies that invest in welcoming, supporting and managing their students;\n- we strive to provide opportunities for experienced employees for them to remain engaged and motivated to bring their experience and expertise as assets for our Company\u2019s success. 91,812 Stellantis employees aged over 50 years old;\n- Stellantis is also committed to hiring and retaining disabled employees. 11,363 disabled employees in 2021.\n\nStellantis also encourages and transforms employee\u2019s ideas and promotes an entrepreneurship spirit within the Company. Through the Stellantis Star*Up program, employees across all 6 regions were invited to submit their ideas in May 2021 and each region selected their top 5 ideas to enter a 3-month incubation phase. The 6 Regional Finals, chaired by the Region\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO) have selected the winning pitch to represent their respective regions in the Global Final on the 13th of October, 2021. This idea will enter in a short experimentation phase to be turned into reality and meet real users.\n\n1.1.4.4 Value created for suppliers and partners\n\nApproximately 85% of a vehicle production costs are the value of direct part purchased. Stellantis large and complex supply chain is an opportunity for suppliers and partners to get involved in a worldwide eco-system facing major changes in its technological choices, customers\u2019 habits and expectations and new approaches to mobility in local markets.\n\nStellantis is committed to sustainable practices in its procurement activity, notably based on the due diligence approach advocated by the OECD and the ILO rules. The selection of suppliers is based not only on the quality and on competitiveness of their products and services, but also on their adherence to social, ethical and environmental principles (third party assessment) and their ability to provide innovative solutions to support Stellantis face such challenges as climate change and wise use of natural resources and raw materials.\nOur Responsible Purchasing Guidelines are also a support for our suppliers to improve their practices. For our suppliers, collaboration with Stellantis is a lever to:\n\n- **Boost innovation** Stellantis involves its core and strategic suppliers in a disruptive innovation process, which is essential in order to meet commitments on reducing CO\u2082 emissions, air quality, the autonomous vehicle, etc. at a cost acceptable to customers. In 2021, 1,311 patents applications were published by Stellantis, more than 300 suppliers are working on joint innovation projects to develop future technologies. In manufacturing, the annual Factory Booster Day in 2021 gave the opportunity to see more than 40 demonstrators from 67 partners to answer the challenges of our Factory of the Future.\n\n- **Boost efficiency** The CSR commitments that the Company asks its suppliers to make, enable them to reduce their own operational risks. Suppliers are well-informed of best practices and regulatory changes, and can therefore benchmark themselves by comparing their performance against the industry average, build on their strengths and implement action plans to work on any weaknesses. Stellantis monitors the progress of the action plans required from suppliers. If necessary, it can help them find solutions to improve their product quality or optimize their processes.\n\n- **Boost economic performance** In view of the demanding supplier selection process, being a strategic or core supplier of Stellantis demonstrates a high-level of economic and CSR performance. Through innovation partnerships with Stellantis, suppliers are developing a competitive edge. This distinguishes them from their competitors when bidding for contracts in other markets. They can create commercial opportunities with customers who, like Stellantis, regard CSR criteria as a key aspect of the supplier selection and listing process. The Company\u2019s suppliers can communicate their own CSR commitment and performance (notably their EcoVadis score) to their customers and/or host regions. Similarly, in being chosen to support Stellantis on international projects, companies are enlarging their prospects by increasing their visibility in new markets. The Kenitra plant in Morocco contributes to boost the Moroccan automotive industry\u2019s ecosystem, helping to create a recognized manufacturing know-how in the Kenitra region. It has helped to establish a cluster joined by 34 new suppliers who have decided to invest in greenfield plants in Morocco to join Stellantis cluster. The Company currently works with 81 local partners, with the aim to achieve a local sourcing rate of 80%.\n\n- **Boost CSR performance** Stellantis also requests the adoption and sharing of sustainable practices among business partners, suppliers and dealers. The third-party assessment of suppliers based on CSR criteria encourages suppliers to be vigilant for CSR risks within their supply chain. Detailed scores in those external CSR assessments allow suppliers to launch action plans to improve their labor and purchasing practices and reduce their environmental impact.\n\nAs a response to the climate change challenge, Stellantis is notably transitioning to electric technology for mobility devices, which rely on raw materials necessary to produce battery components. Some materials pose human rights risks in the supply chain (lithium, aluminum, cobalt). Stellantis annually maps the sourcing of materials that are essential to electric vehicle battery manufacturing, and is a member of global multi partner initiatives (RCS Global, Drive Sustainability notably) to improve risk-identification in the supply chains. Stellantis suppliers are invited to join forces in those global approaches and required to disclose to the Company their raw material suppliers. This allows them to challenge their own supply chains to ensure a better risk coverage. The Company\u2019s responsible purchasing approach is useful in making its suppliers part of a positive trend. In 2021, the average score in EcoVadis of Stellantis suppliers was 53.4 in the environmental category and 53.2 for Human Rights, outperforming all suppliers assessed by EcoVadis, which had an average score of 43.8 and 46.6 respectively.\n\n### 1.1.4.5 Value created for host communities and civil society\n\nA support to the social and solidarity economy and to communities:\n\n- **Philanthropy**: after the merger of Groupe PSA and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), Stellantis managed the transition to its new philanthropic focus and continued to support multi-year projects that started before the merger. The legacy charitable entities managed their former commitments vis-\u00e0-vis the communities.\n\n- **Socially responsible mobility projects**: former Fondation PSA supported mobility projects for social inclusion and mobility projects to promote access to Education and Culture. In 2021, there were 228 driver\u2019s license trainings funded of which 76 targeted students who received their driver\u2019s license and 15 vehicles were co-financed. Through the program\u2019s partnership, in 2020, the first electric vehicle repair training program was created at the ECAUT Production School for 20 students. This training provided young people with additional skills to enter the labor market.\n- **Socially responsible educational projects**: former FCA, notably though the FCA Foundation, supported literacy, scientific education and STEM programs as well as employment development skills, mentoring projects, professional and social inclusion. Over the last three years, FCA Foundation U.S. grants have notably supported 1,000 students in the program focused on teaching mathematics while fostering self-worth, strong values and a sense of family. Students receive personalized tutoring, with an average 50% increase in pretest to posttest scores after just one summer, and with an average of 95% of students going on to college.\n\n- **Philanthropic projects were sponsored by Stellantis in 2021**: 100\n\n- **\u20ac 14.4 m were donated to community organizations in 2021**\n\n- **Support to sheltered economic sector**: the Company has also a strong involvement as a buyer from companies that only employ people with disabilities in France, and has widely expanded its operations in Spain over the last two years. Stellantis works with seven major French associations and with two Spanish associations. Thus, all the Company\u2019s French automotive production plants have a partnership with associations from the sheltered sector. The services bought in 2021 from the adapted and sheltered sector added up to \u20ac48 million.\n\n- **Contribution to road safety, both now and in the future**: Stellantis is contributing to the definition of road safety through several channels: strong commitment in safety-related standardization activities (e.g., Functional Safety and Safety of the Intended Functionality, relevant for autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS)), in several cooperative projects regarding the safety of autonomous driving, in the development of international industry standards in cybersecurity notably through participation in the Automotive-Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Auto-ISAC). In October 2021, Stellantis showed its contribution in the L3Pilot automated driving project at the L3Pilot final event in Hamburg, Germany, in conjunction with ITS World Congress. L3Pilot is the European flagship research and innovation project to test the viability of Level 3 automated driving functions on public roads. During the four-year project, former Groupe PSA and former FCA Research and Advanced Technologies teams - now Stellantis teams - joined forces in a global ecosystem of 34 partners including suppliers, research institutes, road authorities and other OEMs to collect and validate automated driving data in order to test and evaluate Level 3 automated driving functions as a safe and efficient means of transportation on public roads. L3 project: 400,000 km driven on motorways, half of that in automated mode and half as a baseline; 24,000 km driven in urban scenarios, 22,200 km in automated mode and 1,800 km as a baseline.\n\n- **Stellantis also provides emergency rescue sheets with information to rescue teams or first responders on special design elements and the position of components to be considered when assisting the occupants of vehicles involved in an accident. In addition, since March 2010, the Connect Box developed by former Groupe PSA provides assistance when an accident or health related incident occurs in the vehicle. The occupants are connected with a dedicated assistance center that pinpoints the vehicle. Motorway control centers in Europe are automatically warned of any accidents on their roads via the emergency call service in the Company\u2019s equipped vehicles as this is becoming a legal obligation in Europe.**\n\n- **E-call (emergency call system):**\n\n  - **57% of Stellantis model developed with Lane Keeping Assist technologies**\n\nA support to the economic and scientific development of host communities.\n\n- **Support for creation of startups by employees**: Stellantis deploys an entrepreneurial approach inside the Company with the Stellantis Venture Lab. This organization is designed to detect, test and transform opportunities into marketable products and services for Stellantis including the recently launched Car On Demand and MYFREEDOM programs in the U.S. The Incubator welcomes and guides Company employees who have innovative ideas or new business ideas. The methodology is inspired by startups, selected ideas are launched as pilot experiments in the Business Factory. In 2021, 1,375 proposals have been examined, more than 45 have been incubated and 6 have been transformed into experimentation.\nScientific development: The Company acts as a vehicle for scientific development. Stellantis, and in particular its Automotive Research and Advanced Engineering division is providing new technology for its Engineering division and Mobility Business Units. Working on all the maturity phases of the technology (TRL \u2013 Technology readiness Levels) \u2013 basic scientific research, advanced research, pre-development, development and industrialization - is fundamental to provide relevant and on-time mobility solutions to the customers.\n\nThe Company has developed several ways to work on the less mature technologies:\n\n- Collaborative precompetitive projects involving several partners including universities and research centers, that provide the scientific innovation framework for a safe, sustainable, decarbonized and affordable mobility;\n- the Stellab Network of 14 Openlabs that are covering all the fields of technologies. Recently, a new OpenLab focused on disruptive lighting was created at Darmstadt University. Furthermore, the PRAIRIE Institute, initiative FRANCE 3 AI \u2013 was integrated as founding members, to develop long term research in Artificial Intelligence (AI);\n- Three academic chairs run by the Stellab;\n- joint research with national institutions such as VEDECOM, the French institute of technological research for low-carbon, connected and autonomous vehicle that supports the development of new solutions and services within global ecosystems.\n\nScientific Education: Stellantis continued to support scientific education, notably, through the CERN project unveiled in 2019 in Geneva, Switzerland. This ambitious and innovative Science Gateway project is a hub for scientific education and culture, meant to raise awareness, curiosity and love for science in every dimension for the most people possible. The exhibitions will feature CERN\u2019s accelerators, experiments and computing, how scientists use them in their exploration and how CERN technologies benefit society. Hands-on experimentation will be a key part of the Science Gateway\u2019s educational program, allowing visitors to experience first-hand what it is like to be a scientist. The immersive activities available in the Science Gateway will foster critical thinking, evidence-based assessment and use of the scientific method which are important tools in all walks of life.\n\n1.1.4.6 Value created for the environment\n\nMethodologies and technological choices for a concrete impact:\n\n- Eco design to boost innovation: Stellantis conducts LCAs (Life Cycle Assessment) on its vehicles and components to reduce material consumption and environmental impact of materials. These studies analyze the multi-criteria environmental footprint of a vehicle and validate its components and materials design. The entire product life cycle is taken into account from raw material extraction to manufacture, use and end-of-life. In 2021, LCAs covered 62% of the total fleet sold.\n\n- Energy efficiency: the Stellantis Battery Management System features have been designed to maximize efficiency of the useful energy in real life: we increase the useable energy by 4%. Stellantis will strive to offer the best-in-class energy storage efficiency because our platforms will provide the highest energy density, reaching almost 60 kWh per meter.\n\nA circular economy mindset to enlarge the lifespan of a vehicle:\n\n- green materials: Their wider application requires the development of robust supply chains and more research on new materials. Stellantis is involved in a large number of scientific partnerships to boost the development of the green materials industry and expand the use of these materials in vehicles. Few examples: Fiat New 500 (BEV), Fiat 500 MHEV, and Fiat Panda MHEV use 100% Recycled PET (30% from bottles recovered in the sea and 70% from post-consumer) for the textile in the seats, Citroen AMI uses recycled polypropylene on upper bulkhead.\n\nIn addition, the DS4 Crossback includes more than 50 parts (dashboard, console, carpets...) made by recycled polymers and/or natural fibers.\n\n- Sustainable battery life cycle: software monitoring allows maintaining the performance of batteries above 70% in our e Repair centers in countries of operation, (seven operational at the end of 2021), then re-manufacturing in our Battery Expertise Centers and finally recycled with qualified partners. With the volumes growth (100 per year today, 5,000 expected by 2030 and more than 500,000 expected by 2035 for Europe only), and through future partnerships with more efficient recycling technology, it will allow to recover a higher % of qualitative raw materials to be used to manufacture new batteries thereby closing the battery\nlife cycle loop and significantly reducing costs (logistic and raw material recovery). Battery life cycle management is the core of our Circular Economy business model and contributes to the sustainability of our EV. The traction battery recycling rate is 69.3% for electric vehicle Li-ion batteries and 83.8% for hybrid vehicle Ni-MH batteries for ex PSA brands in Europe in 2020, higher than the 50% regulatory thresholds for recycling efficiency and a similar process is planned for ex FCA brands.\n\n- **Responsible recyclability.** Stellantis has implemented the processes needed to fulfill the 95% recovery requirement in vehicle weight, and 85% reusing or recycling materials with traceability processes for information on the weight of materials, substances and the corresponding assessments and analyses. In France, partners track ELVs and ensure the overall recovery rate is achieved. Few examples: at the end of 2021, the Company\u2019s industrial partners were working with networks of 436 certified dismantling companies for former PSA Brands, and 612 for former FCA Brands, with 222 common dismantling companies. In India, we have a business partnership to support the development of Waste Law to treat ELVs and High Voltage Batteries. In Africa, Stellantis implemented a study with Morocco\u2019s government to improve the collection and treatment of ELV. In 2021, Stellantis collected and processed with an internal Individual System 34,609 of ELVs in France for former PSA and FCA brands. These accounted for 40,996 tons of material recovered, of which 87% was recycled.\n\n- **Parts and Service Sustainability.** Stellantis offers a full range of remanufactured parts. These parts support the aftermarket needs of customers, simultaneously reducing the cost of vehicle ownership and decreasing the volume of materials heading to landfills as well as energy consumption. For remanufactured product lines, average raw-material usage is reduced 60-95% while CO\u2082 emissions are cut 30-50% compared with new-part production. Remanufactured offerings cover close to 35% of vehicle parts value. In 2021, 64% of engines, 65% of gearboxes, 38% of clutches, 48% of injectors, 60% of alternators and 62% of particulate filters sold by brands in Europe and North America were remanufactured parts.\n\nA holistic approach to support carbon neutrality and biodiversity recovery, reduce resource use and environmental impacts:\n\n- **Inside the Company boundaries:**\n  - launching an electric product offensive, which aims to sell 100% of electric passengers car sales in Europe and 50% of passengers car and light duty truck sales in North America by 2030, reaching 100% by 2038;\n  - reducing vehicle diversity. Mindful of vehicle CO\u2082 emissions regulations compliance, Stellantis is reducing its vehicle diversity to focus on developing environmentally friendly technologies that can be rolled out on a large scale;\n  - investing in manufacturing process improvements to transform production locations in a more efficient and sustainable condition to reduce their CO\u2082 emissions (through energy efficiency and increased usage of renewable energy), their water consumption and their waste. In 2021, 61% of all the active plants have been qualified as zero waste to landfill facilities and 100% of metal waste is recycled. 93% of plants have ISO 14001 certification;\n\n- **upstream:**\n  - engaging suppliers on climate-related issues: as of 2021, more than 55% of our most important suppliers (based on APV) commit to a CO\u2082 trend which complies with the Paris Agreement;\n  - associating them to decarbonized energy: in South America, where 55% of Stellantis\u2019 plants have already neutralized the scope 1 and 2 of their certified emission inventory by using electricity originated almost entirely from renewable sources and offsetting the residual emissions. The result achieved in the Goiana plant was extended to the 16 suppliers in its supplier park that became the first multi-plant industrial complex to neutralize its emissions in Brazil;\n\n- **downstream:**\n  - providing customers with green energy solutions through day to day smart charging offers:\n    - a partnership signed between Stellantis and Digital Charging Solutions GmbH, will provide Jeep 4xe or Fiat EV customers access to the digital service \u201cMy easy Charge,\u201d offering them a single provider for the largest charging network in the world. With just one app and one single card the charging solution will provide access to more than 130,000 charge points in 21 European countries;\n    - Stellantis\u2019 partnership with NHOA is expected to develop a public fast charging network in Southern Europe. Enabled by renewables and energy storage, the network is expected to be 100% grid integrated. 4,900 fast chargers are expected to be installed by 2025 and 36,000 by 2030;\noutside its value chain:\n\n- supporting the Amazon Forest Carbon Sink Project: since 1998, the PEUGEOT-ONF forest carbon sink project in Mato Grosso, Brazil involves reforesting areas of degraded land and restoring biodiversity while studying the relationship between reforestation and the absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide. More than 645,000 tons of CO\u2082-eq have been sequestered through biomass and soil. Two million trees including more than 50 native species, were reintroduced in a plantation of nearly 2,000 hectares, more than 20 new global species were discovered.\n\n1.1.4.7 Distribution of added value\n\nRevenues\n(in millions of euros)\n\n| Distributions          | 2021 - extract from Annual Report |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                        | (in millions of euros)            |\n|                        | (as a % of revenue)               |\n| CAPEX + R&D\u00b9           | 10,081                            |\n| Public sector\u00b2         | 1,911                             |\n| Employees\u00b3             | 17,100                            |\n| Shareholders\u2074          | 3,765                             |\n\nDuring the year, some of the R&D activities have benefited from aid at EU, national and local level.\n\nPublic Funding for Research and Development\nStellantis\u2075 (\u20ac million)\n\n|                        | 2021 |\n|------------------------|------|\n| Grants                 | 62.8 |\n| Subsidized Loans       | 1.4  |\n\n\u00b9 Gross R&D Expenses, research tax credit and subsidies excluded.\n\u00b2 Corporate Tax.\n\u00b3 Bonuses and profit sharing included.\n\u2074 Distributions to shareholders.\n\u2075 Data refers to legacy FCA entities worldwide and legacy PSA Group perimeter in Enlarge Europe.\n\n1.2 MATERIAL CSR RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES INHERENT TO THE VALUE CREATION MODEL\n\n1.2.1 CSR MACRO-RISKS AND RELATED CSR ISSUES: STELLANTIS CSR PILLARS AND CHALLENGES\n\nStellantis has identified six CSR macro-risks and addresses them in accordance with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. These six CSR macro risks are the six pillars of Stellantis approach to Corporate Social Responsibility. In light of the Company\u2019s activities, each macro-risk has been broken down into a number of CSR issues, which are material to the Company and its stakeholders. These CSR issues are Stellantis CSR challenges.\n\nCSR risk management approach\n\nGiven its determination to take Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) into account in all its decisions and activities, Stellantis takes the same approach in managing CSR risks as it does for its other risks: the CSR risks are subject to internal control and are specifically included in the Company\u2019s Internal Audit plan.\n\nThe Company\u2019s risks and associated control procedures are described in section 1.2.3 and further detailed in the risk management section of the Annual Report.\n### 6 CSR MACRO-RISKS / PILLARS\n\n| I.

These measures are described in this CSR Report. The 22 CSR issues are grouped in 6 macro-risks (pillars).\nSTELLANTIS MATERIALITY MATRIX\n\nMapping of CSR macro-risks/pillars and the CSR issues/challenges\n\nSTELLANTIS\u2019 CSR MACRO-RISKS/PILLARS (DEVELOPED IN 22 CSR ISSUES/CHALLENGES)\n\n- Bringing a tangible impact on climate change\n- Driving the Company transformation through the development of human capital\n- Meeting changing customer expectations on mobility (market risks)\n- Preventing ethics violations\n- Promoting protection and implementing responsible use of natural resources\n- Ensuring protection of human rights and supporting a balanced economic development of territories\n\nIMPORTANCE OF THE STAKEHOLDERS\u2019 EXPECTATIONS ON THE CSR ISSUES\n\nIMPORTANCE OF THE CSR ISSUES FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE\n\nVehicle CO\u2082 emissions\nIndustrial and sites carbon footprint\nCarbon footprint of the supply chain: purchasing and logistics\n\nManagement of Company transformation and social dialogue\nAttracting and developing all talent\nDiversity and equal opportunity\nHealth, safety and well-being in the workplace\n\nDevelopment of new mobility solutions (including autonomous vehicles)\nVehicle and service quality - customer satisfaction\nVehicle safety\n\nEthics in governance and business practices (including relations with public institutions, balanced governance and distribution of added value)\nResponsible management of personal information\nResponsible information to customers\n\nWise use of material in the vehicle life cycle (including product recycling)\nVehicle impact on air quality\nOptimization of material cycles in manufacturing processes (including waste)\nControl of industrial discharge and nuisances\nSustainable water management in manufacturing\nProtection of biodiversity\n\nResponsible purchasing practices (including local sourcing development) to support the Company\u2019s development in host territories\nHuman rights in the supply chain\nPhilanthropic actions to support communities\n\nLast update in 2021\nMateriality Matrix Methodology\n\nThe CSR risk assessment was the first step in the process: the CSR issues and macro-risks were identified based on the expertise of the network of CSR correspondents and contributors, representing relevant organizations within the Company and on a dialogue with main stakeholders. This materiality assessment allowed us to identify critical economic, environmental and social issues on which we have impacts or which have a significant impact on our business performance and long term value creation.\n\nThe result was confirmed by a review of issues reported by industry peers and an analysis of worldwide CSR reference and reporting standards.\n\nA representative sample of stakeholders was then interviewed to ascertain their opinion.\n\nThis structured approach enabled us to score and position the CSR issues on the matrix:\n\n- the position of the issue on the horizontal axis represents the importance of the CSR issue for the business performance of the Company, according to three criteria:\n  - likelihood of the threat materializing and opportunities created by the issue;\n  - the seriousness of the impact for the Company, quantified in monetary terms by the Division affected, in case of absence of action;\n  - impact on long-term performance, in case of absence of action.\n\n- the position of the issue on the vertical axis represents the importance of the stakeholders\u2019 expectations on the CSR issue, based on their assessment on the impact Stellantis activities have on the environment and the society:\n  - the score given for each issue by the interviewed stakeholders reflects their perception of the impact the Company can have on each issue;\n  - the score is weighted based on the contribution of each stakeholder and their expertise on the issues.\n\nThe materiality matrix is compliant with the double materiality principle that companies should report not only on financially material topics that influence their value, but also on economical, environmental and social impacts that the company have on the society.\n\nAn external provider ensured that each issue was scored strictly and fairly using a rigorous methodology.\n\n1.2.3 EXTENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF RISKS\n\nThe overall Risk Management System of Stellantis integrates the identification and assessment of climate-related risks.\n\nStellantis uses a group-wide risk analysis framework to assess, manage and report risks, including climate-related physical and transition risks and opportunities. All functions are expected to identify and update the risks inherent to their activities. The principal risks in each function, those which are most critical, are analyzed each half year. The enterprise risk assessment is based on a bottom-up approach beginning with functional areas, and concludes with the review by the responsible Chief Operating Officers. The central Risk Management team consolidates results into a report for review and validation with the Top Executive Team.\n\nStellantis Protection, Audit and Risk Management Department is in charge of assessing the magnitude of the risk as well as the degree of maturity of the risk management measures adopted. The assessment and prioritization process of risks/opportunities, including those posed by climate change, starts with classification of likelihood of the risk occurrence, potential impact on profitability, business continuity and reputation, and mitigation actions in place. These elements determine the residual risk rating defining the risk significance and prioritization for the Company. Risks that are identified as having high- or medium-high rating are considered significant. The top significant risks, those that might have a substantive financial or strategic impact on the business, are deemed \u201cTop Risks\u201d.\n\nEach Top Risk is then classified by risk categories (Strategic, Operational, Financial and Compliance) and control measures and mitigating actions are subsequently defined.\n\nResults of the risk assessment are submitted to the Audit Committee, assisting the Board of Directors in their responsibility for strategic oversight of risk management activities.

Stellantis has concerns that the climate emergency may be a threat to the operations of industrial and global companies like ours. Likewise, Stellantis is concerned that if not enough is done to correct the current climate situation, the rise in temperatures might drastically affect the environment including water, air and biodiversity, which may alter the ability to sustain human activities. Challenging dialogues with stakeholders, such as investors, institutions, and NGOs, among others, allow the Company to share its vision of carbon neutrality, its targets, its initiatives and solutions.\n\nMore than ever, to address the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and to meet the challenge of drastically reducing its carbon footprint, Stellantis is rethinking its value creation model to anticipate major trends.\n\nClimate change requires a global response, which for Stellantis includes designing vehicles with lower CO\u2082-eq emissions, reducing the carbon impact of manufacturing facilities, logistics and purchasing and putting measures in place to offset any remaining carbon impact. Stellantis views it as an opportunity to be even more agile to face the challenges and to create the future of mobility, allowing for freedom of movement with reduced or no carbon emissions.\n\nTo demonstrate its tangible commitments for a low-carbon economy, Stellantis strengthened its climate governance by having climate change concern embedded in its decision-making processes, and developed a holistic and offensive strategy with the goal to reduce CO\u2082-eq emissions across its entire value chain.\n\n2.1 CONTEXT AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\nStellantis has a holistic approach to climate change.\n\nGiven its main sources of greenhouse gas emissions, the Stellantis decarbonization strategy is threefold:\n\n- cutting CO\u2082 vehicle emissions (for more information, see section 2.5);\n- moving forward into a carbon-efficient production system (for more information, see section 2.6);\n- improving the environmental performance of the supply chain (for more information, see section 2.7).\n\nThe following sections of this Climate Report detail the strategy implemented by Stellantis including the governance, and the actions to achieve the targets, following the recommendations of the Task force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nCSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE #1: Vehicle CO\u2082 emissions\n\nBased on an assessment of more than 14,000 scientific publications, the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) 2021 report on the physical science of climate change demonstrates that human activities have warmed our planet\u2019s atmosphere faster than anything people have experienced for at least 2000 years.\nThe report also answers important questions about how greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants are changing our climate. It sheds light on how plants, soil and the oceans store and release carbon, how the global climate is responding to human influence, and what we may fear about increasing global warming: a water cycle of increasingly variable, lasting changes in ocean and sea levels caused by the melting of frozen spaces on the planet, and more generally, extreme weather and climate events.\n\nBy highlighting the way future human activities change, our climate will affect the planet and its habitants. This report also highlights the importance of the choices we all make today. The recommendations from the IPCC report should support our strategies.\n\nIn its Vision 2050 report published in 2020, the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) projected that CO\u2082-eq emissions from transportation would rise from 10.9 billion tons (Gt) in 2015 to 11.9 Gt in 2019\u20132022. Forty-six percent of those global transportation CO\u2082 emissions come from the four largest vehicle markets: United States, China, the European Union and India.\n\nCertainly, our industry has a role in the global effort to limit the rise of temperatures to 1.5 degrees. To achieve the effort, Stellantis is adapting its business model and launching new technologies in order to meet its milestones and objectives while satisfying consumer demands for improved fuel economy and lower CO\u2082-eq emissions in several markets. Our success depends on our ability to meet regulatory emissions requirements while at the same time seek to meet customer expectations for access to safe, sustainable and affordable mobility solutions. The electrification of vehicles is one of the key actions by which we are supporting the transition to a decarbonized economy while working toward carbon neutrality.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nStellantis believes it has an ethical responsibility to offer customers affordable mobility solutions that are sustainable for the planet and its citizens.\n\nStellantis is determined not only to be compliant with applicable GHG regulations around the globe but to lead the way as a green company. This has been demonstrated since the beginning of Stellantis with a product lineup of 29 electrified vehicles aiming at a leadership position in the industry in terms of low CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nIn 2020, former PSA increased the pace of its electrification strategy with significant investments in a joint venture, ACC supported by the governments of France and Germany, to develop and produce batteries on a large scale in both countries starting in 2023.\n\nStellantis believes that the renewed global ambitions to tackle climate change, including the Paris climate agreement and the EU and U.S. objectives for carbon neutrality by 2050, could be achieved if the ecosystem adapts. Transition to low CO\u2082 transport and mobility at an increased pace requires policy makers to develop and implement a carefully coordinated plan that takes into account the countervailing economic and social challenges associated with this rapid transition. It also requires public authorities to actively support the development of an affordable and sustainable mobility ecosystem through the wise use of the regulatory framework and financial tools and by ensuring the contribution of all sectors and green energy sources of all kinds - in particular the energy sector that should provide green electricity. The availability of a convenient and widespread vehicle recharging and fast charging infrastructure will play a crucial role and must be facilitated. The Company is working with public authorities in designing and testing technologies and standards for electric infrastructures.\n\nCSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE #2: Industrial and site carbon footprint\n\nAlthough the emissions associated with fuel and electricity consumption in our manufacturing and other facilities represents a small part, around 1%, of the Company\u2019s overall carbon footprint, we are committed to reducing carbon emissions from industrial operations and non-manufacturing facilities. We regard this effort as an important factor in tackling climate change. As far as vehicle manufacturing is concerned, the major cause of greenhouse gas emissions is energy consumption. To reduce our impact on climate, Stellantis acts on several levers such as optimizing the energy efficiency of manufacturing processes, using electricity derived from carbon-free renewable sources and adopting more efficient technologies.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nAt Stellantis, we are committed to contributing to a decarbonized economy by engaging our talented teams and assets on the road to carbon neutrality across our products, plants and other facilities. The Company has been rolling out a process for controlling its environmental impact and ensuring continuous improvement. Based on\nour experience (vast majority of our plants are, or are becoming ISO 14001-certified, and the environmental footprint of its manufacturing operations being regularly reduced; 55% of our plants in South America have already neutralized the scopes 1 and 2 of their certified emission inventories, as they buy renewable energy and offset the residual carbon emissions; sourcing 100% of green electricity contracts for eleven plants), we are convinced that the energy transition requires that all actors of the economic ecosystem join forces. Manufacturing companies need to find affordable and available energy sources to implement their decarbonization pathway. Public authorities have a major role with aligning applicable regulations on similar deadlines and with consistent content.\n\nWe also believe solutions need to continue to be found or consolidated: we encourage governments to support research and development efforts related to carbon capture and storage technologies that should contribute to decarbonization.\n\n**CSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE #3: Carbon footprint of the supply chain: purchasing and logistics**\n\nIn addition to emissions from vehicles and manufacturing, there are significant emissions that come from outside the organization. These additional emissions are connected with our activities. The CO\u2082 emissions related to the purchase of goods for use in our products represents more than 10% of the overall European carbon footprint of the Company while inbound and outbound transportation accounts for about 1%.\n\nWe are committed to contributing to a decarbonized economy by following the principles of the Paris Agreement. We engage in this journey with our supply base to support our leadership in clean and advanced technologies for mobility solutions. We also ask them to commit to the same objectives of reducing their impact on the climate.\n\nStellantis works to reduce the CO\u2082 emissions associated with logistics as the environmental impact of inbound and outbound transportation is far-reaching, ranging from local impact, such as sound, air pollution, etc., to global warming. The challenge is to optimize transport plans, loads and volumes and the use of multimodal transport.\n\n**Company\u2019s public position**\n\nStellantis supports the decarbonization development of suppliers in the automotive industry through several organized initiatives. These include local and worldwide initiatives of the automotive industry, amongst them several in Europe and North America at a national (PFA; AIAG; VDA; ANFIA) and regional level (by the ARIAs, automotive competitiveness clusters, regional automotive industry associations; ACEA) with public authorities and the administration (refer to 7.1.6).\n\nThe Global Purchasing and Supply Chain Division supplements this automotive industry network and its ecosystem by appointing regional leadership in each manufacturing cluster around the world.\n\nIt involves suppliers in the Company\u2019s approach to reducing CO\u2082 emissions in the supply chain, i.e., emissions by its suppliers for the production of goods and services purchased by the Company. Stellantis GPSC strategy in monitoring suppliers CO\u2082 emissions is supported by various external partners, like the CDP Supply Chain Module and EcoVadis (see section 2.7.3.2).\n\nStellantis is aware that environmental matters are global and transversal in their scale and as such recognizes the importance of a holistic approach to the environmental footprint of our operations as well as that of our suppliers.\n\nStellantis supports both carbon neutrality objectives as well as the need for an environmental level playing field. The focus of the European Commission proposal for a carbon tax on steel and aluminum production is meaningful as these two materials account for a large portion of the CO\u2082 emissions in the supply chain of vehicle production. Stellantis supports the general idea of a carbon price and more specifically a carbon border taxes provided that (1) the taxes do not disproportionately impact domestic production compared to imported vehicles and (2) any extension of the scheme carefully assesses the cumulative impact on the competitiveness of the local production and is implemented in a gradual manner.\n\nStellantis welcomes the European Union decision to improve and increase multimodal transport solutions and is looking for opportunities for Stellantis European plants. The Company is also attentive to the evolution of transport regulations, and is favorable to new and innovative solutions that enable freight transport to reduce GHG emissions such as Gigaliners.\n##

NET ZERO COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT THE PLANET\u2019S CARBON NEUTRALITY\n\nStellantis targets to become Carbon Net Zero on the whole value chain by 2038, with single digit percent compensation of residual emissions vs 2021 level.\n\nIn order to contribute to the collective global carbon neutrality objective in the most efficient way, Stellantis strategy is based on energy consumption reduction first, then carbon footprint reduction at the maximum, before balancing residual GHG emissions with carbon removal and additional other compensation solutions if relevant.\n\nImpacts on other environmental criteria of Life-Cycle Assessment are also taken into consideration.\n\nTo achieve this target, Stellantis has defined a comprehensive, long-term, Carbon Net Zero roadmap, including an intermediate target of -50% reduction by 2030 vs 2021, based on the following key milestones:\n\n- by 2030, Stellantis targets to reduce GHG emissions by -75% on industrial sites and real estate (scope 1 and 2 of GHG protocol) and to use 100% of decarbonized electricity;\n- Stellantis continues to reduce the Well-to-Wheel CO\u2082 emissions of its vehicles, due to electrification roadmap, improvement of BEV efficiencies and fuel consumption of remaining ICE vehicles (scope 3 Use of sold products of GHG protocol). By 2030, Stellantis intends to sell 100% BEV for passenger cars in Europe and 50% BEV for passenger cars and light-duty trucks in the U.S.;\n- Stellantis intends to actively engage with its suppliers to reduce the carbon footprint of purchased parts, especially led by an objective of cutting by 40% the carbon footprint of purchased parts of BEV by 2030 (scope 3 Purchased goods and services of GHG protocol).\n\nThese objectives can be reached under the condition that the ecosystem adapts at the right pace and is conducive to electrification (public policies, charging infrastructure, decarbonized electricity, etc.).\n\nTo establish its targets, Stellantis referred to the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) methodology, based on Sector Decarbonization Approach for transport sector. The 2030 intermediate targets covering absolute GHG emissions from scopes 1 and 2 and Well-to-Wheel CO\u2082 emissions from scope 3 are in line with Paris Climate agreement and 1.5\u00b0C scenario.\n\nThe targets are defined assuming no change in the lifetime mileage of vehicles over the years, nevertheless, we will also work on the improvement of the durability of our vehicles.\n\n2.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF CLIMATE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nThe automobile industry is facing profound economic, regulatory, environmental and societal challenges, notably driven by the fight against climate change. This translates into an increasing pressure from all stakeholders (financial players, customers, regulators, civil society, NGOs and suppliers). In this context, the identification and the management of climate-related risks and opportunities is a key approach for Stellantis to work towards business sustainability.\n\nManaging those risks and opportunities leads Stellantis to define a clear decarbonization strategy, ambitious objectives and efficient enablers.\n\nGiven its determination to embed CSR in its decisions and activities, climate risks are managed by specific strategic actions and resources within the area of expertise required. Risks management is integrated at the heart of the strategy across the organization, from the decision-making bodies to the operational entities.\nOUR IDENTIFIED CLIMATE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nTRANSITIONAL RISKS\n- Policy and legal\n- Technology\n- Market\n- Social\n- Reputation\n\nPHYSICAL RISKS\n- Supply chain\n- Facilities\n- Scarcity\n\nOUR IDENTIFIED CLIMATE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nOUR VISION FOR CLIMATE\n\nContribute to a global carbon neutrality, with an ambitious carbon footprint reduction roadmap\n\nOUR CLIMATE STRATEGY\n\n- Innovation breakthroughs for low-carbon technologies\n- Strategic partnerships to master the EV value chain\n- New mobility solutions expansion\n- Close collaboration and innovation with stakeholders across the supply chain (purchasing and logistics)\n- Carbon / energy-efficient and resilient production assets (Stellantis production way roadmap)\n\nOUR OBJECTIVES FOR 2038\n\n- Carbon Net Zero of the whole value chain (scope 1, 2 and 3) with single digit % compensation of residual emissions vs 2021 level\n- 100% nameplates with BEV offering in Europe and U.S.\n- 100% BEV sales in Europe and 100% BEV sales in U.S.\n- Carbon Net Zero of the supply chain with minimal compensation\n- Absolute greenhouse gas emissions reduced by more than 90% for scope 1 and 2\n\nOUR ENABLERS\n\n- Efficient governance with clear responsibilities\n- Solid climate-related risk management with scenario analysis\n- Transparent climate monitoring with ambitious metrics and targets\n- Focused research and development/innovation investments\n- Continuous workforce skill improvement policy\n- Benchmark and sharing best practices to improve overall consumption by plants\n\n1 commitments, targets and conditions are detailed in 2.2\n2 for passenger cars\n3 for passenger cars and light-duty trucks\nIn order to manage its carbon footprint, Stellantis annually quantifies the total CO\u2082 equivalent of greenhouse gases, primarily CO\u2082 emitted from its activities over the whole life cycle of its automotive products. As recommended by the SBTi, Stellantis\u2019 carbon footprint methodology takes its global activity and the real life emissions of the vehicles into account.\n\nIn 2019, Eco Act, a specialized firm in environmental analysis and greenhouse gas diagnostics, verified and approved this method that has been adapted to the Stellantis scope.\n\nThe first assessment that has been conducted under the new Stellantis scope is limited to Europe, further global assessment are being developed. In 2021, the total Stellantis emissions of CO\u2082 equivalent for vehicles sold in Europe amount to 136 million tons.\n\nTotal carbon footprint of vehicles sold by Stellantis in Europe during the year: main emission items\n\n| UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES | COMPANY ACTIVITIES | DOWNSTREAM ACTIVITIES |\n|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| SCOPE 3 (Indirect emissions) | SCOPE 1 AND 2 (Direct and indirect emissions) | SCOPE 3 (Indirect emissions) |\n| PURCHASING | PROCESS AND FACILITIES PERFORMANCE | USE OF VEHICLES SOLD (WtW) |\n| 11% | Fuel and electricity consumption in plants | 85.1%\u00b9 |\n| Extraction of materials and production of parts used by Stellantis for its business | 1.2% | Fuel and electricity production (WtT) |\n| UPSTREAM TRANSPORT | tertiary sites | 16.3% |\n| 0.4% | 0.04% | Exhaust emissions (TtW) |\n| Transport of materials and parts to Stellantis plants | dealership networks | 68.8% |\n| WORK-RELATED TRAVELS | see 2.7 | see 2.5 |\n| 0% | see 2.7 | |\n| Movement of employees | |\n\n\u00b9WtW= Well-to-Wheel  WtT= Well-to-Tank  TtW= Tank-to-Wheel\n\nThe steps taken by Stellantis to reduce the emissions of these emission sources are described in the sections indicated.\nThis assessment considers the following carbon footprints for Europe:\n\n- **Carbon footprint of DOWNSTREAM ACTIVITIES**: Downstream activities emissions amount to 87% of the CO\u2082 equivalent emissions of the overall vehicle carbon footprint. The vehicle use phase represents 85% of the overall emissions. While emissions from vehicle maintenance weight 1.4% of the total. The recovery and recycling of end-of-life vehicles account for 0.6% and the downstream transport of produced vehicles to the point of sales account for 0.2%. The assessment takes into account:\n  - the use of vehicles produced in 2021 according to the CO\u2082 emissions data for each vehicle sold and the following operating criteria: real-life consumption assumptions (increase compared to WLTP emissions: +10% for ICE vehicle and +20% for electrical consumption of LEV vehicle) and use over 15 years with 225,000 km driven;\n  - the impact of the production of the fuels used by conventional vehicles are evaluated using life cycle analysis (LCA) databases;\n  - the impact of the production of the electricity used by the electrified vehicles are evaluated based on forecasted International Energy Agency scenario;\n  - the production of spare parts used for the maintenance of the cars, using LCA databases;\n  - the vehicle end-of-life modelled on current processes;\n  - the downstream transport (for more information, see section 2.7);\n\n- **Carbon footprint of UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES**: Upstream activities emissions amount to 11.5% of the CO\u2082 equivalent emissions of the overall vehicle carbon footprint. It includes emissions associated with the extraction of raw materials and the production of parts purchased by Stellantis for its vehicles (11% of total GHG emissions) and the upstream transport of materials and parts to the company\u2019s plants (0.4%).\n\n- **The assessment takes into account**:\n  - all component materials of vehicles manufactured in 2021 from extraction to molding and assembly on the vehicle, using life cycle analysis databases;\n  - the upstream transport (for more information, see section 2.7);\n  - the work-related travel have not been considered due to high level of remote work and strong reduction of business trips.\n\n- **Carbon footprint of Company activities**: Company activity emissions (direct and indirect emissions) amount to 1.22% of the CO\u2082 equivalent emissions of the overall vehicle carbon footprint. They are associated with fuel and electricity consumption in manufacturing plants (assembly plants or components factories) for 115%, tertiary sites (0.04%) and dealership networks (0.03%). They are derived from a GHG (greenhouse gas) assessments carried out at Stellantis plants, tertiary sites and Company-owned dealership network (for more information, see section 2.6).\n\n### 2.3.1 FACING REALITY AS IT IS: CLIMATE RELATED RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION AND ACROSS THE VALUE CHAIN\n\nOn the Stellantis materiality matrix, climate change appears as one of the top macro-risks the Company has to tackle. It requires a global and comprehensive response supporting the attainment of our carbon-neutrality target in the long-term as well as our intermediate targets in the short-to-medium term. A clear and transparent acknowledgement of the risks and issues related to climate change is therefore vital for Stellantis to work towards sustainability.\n\n#### 2.3.1.1 Extensive assessment of climate risks\n\nAs part of its Risk Management System, Stellantis uses its company-wide risk analysis framework to assess, manage and report climate-related physical and transition risks and opportunities. This is described in section 1.2.3 of this document. Given their potential impact on the Company\u2019s situation, the two climate-related risks, \u2018natural hazards\u2019 and \u2018global carbon footprint\u2019, are considered as top risks and presented to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\n2.3.1.2. Sowing the seeds of the carbon-neutral future opens new business opportunities\n\nIn accordance with the TCFD recommendations, our climate-related risk assessment sorts risks into two categories: transition risks and physical risks. The assessment of transition climate-related risks considers risks related to the current and emerging regulation, technology risks, legal risks, market risks and reputation risks. As for the assessment of physical climate-related risks, it considers both acute risks from extreme weather conditions such as floods or wildfires and chronic risks such as impacts of rising temperatures and accelerating loss of biodiversity.\n\nWhile the climate crisis generates transition and physical risks, Stellantis also considers it as an opportunity. The Company\u2019s agility enables it to focus on the most relevant market stakes and to rapidly implement decisions made to adapt to evolving mobility expectations. New \u201clow-carbon\u201d mobility solutions and urban mobility markets are becoming significant sources of revenue. Along with operational efficiency and technological innovation, they enhance the leadership and value of Stellantis.\n\nThe process used to assess and manage climate-related opportunities is identical to the one used to manage climate-related risks, in the sense that they are embedded within the Company\u2019s business lines, with entities managing specific climate issues that are within their area of expertise.\n\n### RISK #1: More stringent CO\u2082 emissions regulations thresholds for car manufacturers\n\n**Type of risk:** Transition Risk: Policy and Legal  \n**Timeframe:** Short-term (until 2025)\n\n| Risks | MITIGATION STRATEGY | Opportunities | ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES |\n|-------|---------------------|---------------|--------------------------|\n| The number, scope and ambition of regulatory requirements regarding greenhouse gas emissions are expected to increase significantly in the future. This concerns vehicle fuel efficiency regulations and emissions standards as well as regulations that apply to Stellantis\u2019 production facilities and to most of its suppliers. A failure to comply may lead to fines, vehicle recalls, the suspension of sales and may adversely affect Stellantis\u2019 reputation. Stellantis takes this risk into account because the Company sells vehicles in countries where regulations on fuel consumption are severe. | Developing an increasingly low carbon offer relying on an ambitious electrification roadmap.  \nRefer to section 2.5.3  \nInvesting in process improvements to transform production locations in a more efficient and sustainable condition to make them less energy-intensive and increase the renewable energy usage.  \nRefer to section 2.6  \nEngaging suppliers on climate-related issues to avoid supply chain disruptions due to more stringent emissions regulations.  \nRefer to section 2.7.3.1  \nRelying on a strong vertical integration strategy to reduce the Company\u2019s dependency on suppliers and to reduce the risk of supply chain disruptions or cost increases due to emissions-related regulations.  \nRefer to section 2.5.3.2.2 | Reducing vehicle diversity. Mindful of vehicle CO\u2082 emissions regulations compliance, Stellantis is reducing its vehicle diversity to focus on developing environmentally friendly technologies that can be rolled out on a large scale.  \nAssociating suppliers to decarbonized energy. In Brazil, where the electricity originates almost entirely from renewable sources, most of Stellantis\u2019 plants already neutralized their residual emissions. Stellantis associated its onsite suppliers in Goiana to decarbonized energy so they could also neutralize their impacts.  \nIncreasing business attractiveness. Stellantis considers complying with European Taxonomy regulation by properly disclosing the share of Taxonomy-aligned turnover and expenditures (capital and operational) will provide several opportunities, such as demonstrating to customers, media and financial markets our incremental contribution to sustainable mobility and confirming our attractiveness as taxonomy will allow comparison between companies of the same sector regarding their share of Taxonomy-aligned activities. The Company will have access to new financial instruments at favorable conditions, such as EU Green bonds. |\n## RISK #2: Impacts on the business model of the transition to low carbon technologies\n\n**Type of risk:** Transition Risk: Technological  \n**Timeframe:** Short-term (until 2025)\n\n| Risks | Opportunities |\n|-------|---------------|\n| **RISK DESCRIPTION**  \nThe registration of LEVs is increasing sharply and is expected to keep growing.  \n**POTENTIAL IMPACT**  \nThe transition to low carbon technologies may lead to an increase in vehicle price and have a negative impact on the demand addressed by the company\u2019s products, especially if government subsidies for EV sales are not maintained. Manufacturers may not be able to generate profit from LEV sales as anticipated since competitive pricing might be used in order to win market share, while adversely affecting profits. Technological capabilities may prove short-lived if BEVs replace PHEVs sooner than expected. After-sales revenue may also be impacted as EVs require less maintenance than ICE vehicles. The transition to LEVs could create a loss of added value if carmakers fail to obtain expertise in electrified technologies. Since EV manufacturing reduces the number of workers needed per vehicle produced, increased LEV sales could impact workforce volume. However, eventual delays in the development of new technology for electrification may result in the loss of revenue and market shares. The inability to keep up with the market\u2019s electrification trends would prevent the company from complying with CAFE regulations. | **MITIGATION STRATEGY**  \n**Speeding-up the electrification of the car line in all segments.** Stellantis aims to over perform the market with its LEV sales, anticipating LEV pricing improvements due to a reduced Total Cost of Ownership.  \n**Refer to section 2.5.3.2**  \n**Gaining control over EV components supply chain to maintain the value added.**  \n**Refer to section 2.5.3.2.2**  \n**Optimizing battery cost.** The Battery Management System aims to maximize the useful energy in real life, and controlling the aging to postpone discharge as much as possible.  \n**Anticipating the impacts of the company\u2019s decarbonization strategy on its workers, in a \u201cjust transition approach\u201d** Stellantis boosts its workers\u2019 employability through training programs.

As Stellantis implements electrified powertrain applications throughout its portfolio, it depends on a significant supply of lithium, nickel and cobalt and on the supply of parts.  \n**POTENTIAL IMPACT**  \nIncreased market power of raw materials and batteries suppliers may negatively impact Stellantis\u2019 ability to negotiate with its suppliers and may provoke raw material inflation. Price increases would increase Stellantis\u2019 operating costs and could reduce profitability. If the increased costs are passed through to customers via higher vehicles prices, the demand addressed to the products sold by Stellantis might decrease. Certain raw materials needed in lithium-ion batteries are sourced from a limited number of suppliers and countries. These may be susceptible to supply shortages or disruptions. Their sourcing may also cause negative environmental or social impacts. The global demand and supply of a single part could have huge impacts on our production. If Stellantis fails to optimize the raw materials and components used in its manufacturing processes, it may face increased production costs. | **MITIGATION STRATEGY**  \nImplementing battery circular economy solutions to reduce automobile manufacturers\u2019 pressure on scarce raw materials.  \nRefer to section 6.1.7  \nA vertical integration strategy regarding LEVs production.  \nAutomotive Cells Company (ACC - European partnership with TotalEnergies and Mercedes-Benz) and other two JVs (one with with Samsung SDI and one with LG energy Solutions in North America) planned five gigafactories in Europe and North America by 2025. Those are meant to secure Stellantis\u2019 battery supply.  \nRefer to section 2.5.3.2.2  \nCarbon free European and North American lithium sourcing. Stellantis signed direct off take contracts with lithium geothermal partners. Tier 1 battery suppliers also secured anode/cathode supply contracts in Europe.  \nRefer to section 6.1.7.6  \n**ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES**  \nPlanning dual chemistry battery strategy and solid-state batteries.  \nFrom 2024 dual chemistry strategy based on two cobalt free batteries to relieve EVs of raw materials concerns.  \nJoint development agreement signed with Factorial Energy to become a significant player in the solid-state batteries market in 2026.  \nRefer to section 2.5.3.2.4  \nRelying on alternative sourcing. Stellantis promotes the materials coming from recycling supply chains. Engineering resources are dedicated to increasing their rate in the production of vehicles.  \nRefer to section 6.1.7.2  \nReducing CO\u2082 emissions in the supply chain. Resource efficiency is an opportunity to combine competitiveness and climate change mitigation. Reducing the consumption of raw materials is a win-win situation: it reduces the purchases expenditures as well as the carbon footprint.  \nRefer to section 2.7 |\n### RISK #4: Changing mobility market due to shifts in customer preferences\n\n**Type of risk:** Transition Risk: Market  \n**Timeframe:** Medium-term (2026-2035)\n\n| Risks | Opportunities |\n|-------|---------------|\n| **RISK DESCRIPTION**  \nThe automotive industry is facing disruptive trends that range from the emergence of the mobility services market to the acceleration of new technologies such as the autonomous vehicle. Automotive markets are shifting from vehicle ownership to shared mobility services that change the use of the vehicle fleet. More environmentally conscious consumers turn to product-service systems that encourage the collaborative consumption of goods and services. In some areas of the world, consumers are more reluctant to buy new vehicles and would rather look for shared mobility services. The risk for Stellantis is insufficient adaptation of its business model to new forms of mobility.  \n**POTENTIAL IMPACT**  \nAs new forms of mobility gain consumer acceptance, vehicle sales may decrease in some markets. The loss of revenue could affect profitability, lead to asset impairment and a fall in their securities valuation. The mobility service market may negatively affect the strength of Stellantis\u2019 brands: new mobility services make it harder to differentiate a company\u2019s products from those of its competitors and therefore harder to encourage customer loyalty. | **MITIGATION STRATEGY**  \nDeveloping a portfolio of mobility services to prevent any gap between the market and Stellantis\u2019 business strategy. Free2Move and Leasys aim to compete with other actors, in and out of the automotive sector, on subscription economy trends. They represent opportunities for Stellantis to increase its revenue and gain market share outside of its traditional segments.  \n**ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES**  \nPursuing revolutionary autonomous driving projects as part of a multi-partner strategy. While tech players and start-ups should play an important role in the development of the autonomous vehicle market, it also represents a huge opportunity for traditional carmakers who manage to launch innovative high technology projects. |\n\nRefer to section 4.1.7 >\n### RISK #5: Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events and water shortages\n\n**Type of risk:** Physical Risk: Acute  \n**Timeframe:** Medium-term (2026-2035)\n\n| Risks | Opportunities |\n|-------|---------------|\n| **RISK DESCRIPTION**  \nScience shows that extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense, that incremental climatic changes are very likely to happen, and that their impacts are expected to grow more severe over the coming years and decades. The impacts of physical risks are uncertain, in probability, magnitude and timing.  \nWater shortages represent a direct risk for Stellantis since its manufacturing sites use water for production processes. In 2021, 36 plants were located in a high water-stressed area (according to the World Resources Institute Aqueduct \u201cbaseline water stress\u201d indicator). These sites represent 31% of the Company\u2019s production volume.  \n**POTENTIAL IMPACT**  \nStellantis\u2019 production facilities and supply chain are subject to risks related to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes and other climatic phenomena. Any catastrophic loss or significant damage to any of its facilities would likely disrupt Stellantis\u2019 operations, delay production and adversely affect its product development schedules and shipments and lead to a loss of revenue. Our suppliers and the entire extended supply network is also vulnerable to these same disruptive impacts, potentially leading to disruption in the supply of parts for Stellantis. The occurrence of a major incident at a single manufacturing site could compromise the production and sale of several hundred thousand vehicles. Any such loss or significant damage could result in expense to repair or replace the facility. Physical climate-related risks could also have an impact on the cost of insurance. Conflicts of use in water stressed areas could have significant repercussions, notably economic and social impacts that would change the company\u2019s relations with some of its stakeholders. Inadequate water supply for the painting and refrigeration processes would increase Stellantis\u2019 operating costs. Conflicts of use in water stressed areas could also have significant repercussions, notably economic and social impacts that would change the company\u2019s relations with some of its stakeholders. | **MITIGATION STRATEGY**  \nMaking and updating plans for business continuity and activity recovery at sites, according to their exposure to the risks and their criticality. Stellantis evaluates the probability of future impacts due to earthquakes, flooding, storms and hurricanes on its sites. Suppliers are encouraged to do the same. Stellantis is able to identify the most resilient supply chain options and associated suppliers.  \n**Relying on an effective risk-assessment method** to evaluate the use of water in water-stressed facility locations and, as a result, to mitigate future climate change impacts in those areas.  \n**Striving for responsible water stewardship.** To anticipate conflicts of use in water stressed areas and to comply with a developing regulatory framework, Stellantis set the objective to reach 1 m$^3$ of water withdrawn per vehicle produced in industrial activities, an improvement of almost 80% compared to current performance.  \n**Proactive environmental management of the supply chain**  \nIn order to minimize risks and avoid supply chain incidents we monitor and require ISO 14001 Certification from our supply base as well as Carbon accounting activities covered by the Stellantis Supply Chain CDP Program. For strategic suppliers we additionally review environmental topics during the Top supplier Meetings. Operationally we work to optimize our supply chains by optimization of transport plans and -routes.  \n**ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES**  \nReusing effluents for industrial use.

The higher the climate sensitivity is, the more the climate risks affect Stellantis activities for those same CSR issues. For each issue, Stellantis adopts measures proportionate to its position in the materiality matrix and its sensitivity to climate.\n\n2.3.1.3 A specific management of physical climate risks\n\nIdentifying and assessing the medium and long-term evolution of climate changes in terms of frequency and severity are key for Stellantis to build appropriate adaptation plans, manage the related financial impacts and mitigate the risks. In its global risk assessment, Stellantis evaluates the physical risks on its owned sites as well as in its supply chain. Indeed, extreme weather events or natural disasters could damage production facilities owned by Stellantis and its suppliers\u2019 sites, disrupting production and leading to costly delivery delays for the end customer, or resulting in plant repair costs.\n\nFor its own operations, Stellantis has implemented assertive industrial risk prevention strategies designed to:\n\n- prevent the occurrence of major incidents;\n- limit and control high-risk situations;\n- enable the various Stellantis structures to deal with emergency and crisis situations;\n- promote a risk prevention culture;\n- and optimize the transfer to the insurance market of high frequency risks.\n\nStellantis sites continue to build and update their plans for continuity and recovery of operations according to their exposure to the risks and their criticality to the business. To evaluate the physical risks of Stellantis sites, the Company insurance partners use natural disaster risk analyses from insurance databases, such as NatCatService from Munich RE. They monitor and analyze the number of past geophysical, meteorological, hydrological and climatological events and their related financial losses. They also project future occurrences of natural disasters and their potential physical impacts. Based on this data, Stellantis evaluates the probability of future impacts due to earthquakes, flooding, storms, and hurricanes on all its sites. This methodology was applied globally to 120 sites worldwide. As flood events are\namong the most relevant natural hazards that could affect Stellantis sites, a specific flood risk assessment study was done on the sites that were potentially exposed to a higher flood risk across the regions. The sites also continue to develop prevention plans based on those analyses with the adapted protocols, whereby investment requests regarding risk management are presented.\n\nIn its global risk assessment, Stellantis not only evaluates the physical risks on its owned sites, but also in its supply chain. The strategy to manage physical climate-related risks along the supply chain begins with a simplified, semi-quantitative approach used to prioritize suppliers, which helps focus on those crucial suppliers with the greatest potential impact or loss likelihood to Stellantis supply chains. A second step entails a methodology and supporting tool that allows Stellantis to assign a risk management maturity index to the supplier risk management processes. The final step is to work with specialized third-party risk research and development advisors to identify and quantify risks that could impact the supply of components to Stellantis and develop adequate action plans to mitigate those risks.\n\nIn terms of supplier selection processes, climate-related physical risks analyses based on the same tools are also used on suppliers\u2019 sites based on their GPS coordinates. Stellantis is therefore able to identify the most resilient supply chain options and associated suppliers.\n\nAnother way to manage climate-related physical risks in the supply chain is to support the increase in the recycling rates of critical raw materials and favor the integration of recycled material in our vehicles which also reduces the Company\u2019s dependence on raw materials supplies. For more information, see section 6.1.\n\n2.3.2 RESILIENCE STRATEGY BUILT WITH CLIMATE-RELATED SCENARIOS\n\nIn order to assess the impacts of both transition and physical climate-related risks in its strategy and planning and thus to build an effective resilience strategy, Stellantis takes into account how these risks could potentially evolve and what their implications might be. Indeed, most impacts of climate change are likely to affect Stellantis\u2019 business and strategy in the medium-to-long term. This generates uncertainty concerning future climate events and the solutions that might be encountered to mitigate these risks. On those grounds, the company uses qualitative and quantitative climate-related scenario analysis for three main purposes:\n\nTo make technology mix projections\n\nThe assessment of transition climate-related risks is based on a qualitative and quantitative climate-related scenario analysis. The scenarios used by Stellantis notably include potential scenarios for technological development or market conditions. Marketing and products division teams use various climate-related scenarios based on internal assessment, that are benchmarked with business partners and external scenarios developed by climate specialists, to ensure consistency with 1.5\u00b0C scenario. The output of those scenarios is the potential market evolution by energy and technologies and for different geographical zones, taking into account electricity mix projections in the countries considered. This analysis enables Stellantis to understand the minimum and maximum thresholds of electrified vehicles needed on the market to be aligned with Climate Paris Agreement. The use of climate-related scenarios also helps identifying the share of effort to be made to optimize CO\u2082 emissions on conventional thermal vehicles in order to reach Stellantis target relating to the average CO\u2082 emissions of all vehicles.\n\nTo set greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets\n\nThe use of climate-related scenarios supports the development of company-wide climate-related targets and the targets defined for scopes 1, 2 and 3 are aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C scenario. The assumptions for the decarbonization of electricity are based on the International Energy Agency scenarios.\nTo measure Stellantis\u2019 assets exposure to climate events\nStellantis\u2019 assessment of physical climate-related risks for Stellantis assets and for its suppliers is based on a qualitative and quantitative climate-related scenario analysis. The Company relies on its insurance partners who notably use natural disaster risk analyses from insurance databases, such as NatCatService from Munich RE or Sigma from Swiss RE. One of the most extreme scenarios considered in these databases is the IPCC RCP 8.5 scenario, the \u201cworst-case climate scenario\u201d studied in the IPCC fifth assessment report.\n\n2.3.3 CLIMATE EMBEDDED INTO BUSINESS PLANNING VIA THE USE OF AN INTERNAL PRICE OF CARBON\n\nStellantis has implemented two distinct internal carbon prices.\n\nA shadow price of carbon to reveal industrial climate-related risks and opportunities\nAll plants have CO\u2082 reduction targets and are required to present roadmaps to reach Stellantis carbon net zero ambition and present yearly progress.\n\nThe decision making process which allows capital investments in carbon reduction projects takes carbon price into account as well as the alignment with the decarbonization goals.\n\nAn internal carbon price to measure the cost efficiency of technical levers that reduce vehicle CO\u2082 emissions\nStellantis uses an internal carbon price to measure the cost efficiency of technical levers that reduce vehicle CO\u2082 emissions. This allows Stellantis to propose an optimized set of CO\u2082 reduction levers on its vehicles based on a cost-efficiency analysis.\n\n2.4 CLIMATE GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nIn order to have an efficient governance to support the implementation of decisions related to climate actions, Stellantis has embedded climate issues at various levels of the organization, with responsibility exercised within the Company\u2019s management and executive functions. Taking steps for climate to be central in decisions and operations can protect performance and enable Stellantis to improve its economic and financial efficiency by safeguarding the value of its assets, managing its risks more effectively and protecting its value and sustainability in the medium- to long-term.\n\n2.4.1 SUPERVISORY BODIES: STRIVING FOR LONG-TERM CLIMATE RESILIENCE\n\nBodies responsible for climate risks and opportunities oversight and control\nStellantis N.V. has a one-tier management structure: the Board of Directors is responsible for management and strategic direction of the Company as well as oversight and control. The CEO is supported by the Top Executive Team aiming to secure worldwide profitable growth for Stellantis.\n\nWithin this governance structure, the Board of Directors considers subjects that link to the strategic plan. Climate being a key topic, the Board of Directors ensures that the strategy fits with Stellantis long-term vision and climate resilience, but also that related risks and opportunities stemming from the effects of climate change are properly identified and managed.\n\nThe CEO and the Strategy Council are responsible for defining the overall environmental strategy, including Climate related policies. The CEO reports to the Board of Directors.\n\nMajor strategic projects with significant impact on the CO\u2082 emissions of the Company\nor its products are being brought to the Board of Directors for review and decisions. Those projects can be related to vehicle CO\u2082 emissions reduction, as well as product planning or new mobility offers with CO\u2082 emission reduction targets.\n\nOther major projects that can be impacted by the consequences of climate change, such as location of new sites, are also reviewed by the Board.\n\nThe Board reviews the related financial implications of strategic projects with significant impact on CO\u2082 emissions, such as the CAPEX or strategic transformation needed to implement these projects. The Board discusses these projects for approval after being informed about aspects such as CO\u2082 emission consequences and expected changes in the future mobility market.\n\nDuring Board meetings, Stellantis\u2019 strategic climate commitments, their implementation and their progress vs targets, are presented to the Board of Directors, in order to deliver relevant information on the climate-related CSR issues impacting the organization.\n\n**Board of Directors committees: incorporation of climate related topics**\n\nWith its 11 members, the Board of Directors has implemented three Committees with specific roles:\n\n- the Audit Committee;\n- the ESG Committee;\n- the Remuneration Committee.\n\nThese specialized Committees prepare and produce work for the Board of Directors. Each Committee issues proposals, recommendations and opinions within the scope of its responsibilities.\n\n**ESG Committee**\n\nThe ESG Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating reports on the Company\u2019s sustainable development policies and practices, management standards, strategy, performance and governance globally. It is also responsible for reviewing, assessing and making recommendations regarding strategic guidelines for sustainability-related issues and reviewing the annual CSR Report.\n\nIn 2021, climate change-related topics have been addressed by the Committee in its meetings.\n\n---\n\n**2.4.2 EXECUTIVE BODIES: PUTTING CLIMATE RESPONSIBILITY AS A CENTRAL THEME IN EXECUTIVE DECISION-MAKING**\n\nThe Top Executive Team has a broad reach across the organization; therefore, it has a global vision of climate-sensitive challenges and the impacts these challenges have on the Stellantis business model and management bodies. The Top Executive Team monitors progress against climate commitments and objectives, and reviews the top risks with a particular focus on climate change, especially vehicle CO\u2082 emissions, as the most strategic CSR issue for Stellantis.\n\nTherefore, climate-sensitive issues are embedded in decisions made by the Top Executive Team on reviewing and guiding major plans of action, annual budgets or business plans.\n\nAt the Executive level, two global Committees review climate-related topics:\n\n**The Strategy Council**\n\nThe role of the Strategy Council is to look at the long-term future and potential courses of action for growth and to define the Strategic Plan and validate the corresponding investment plans. Since the topic of CO\u2082 emissions of vehicles is a strategic issue for Stellantis, the Strategy Council\u2019s role is to verify that proposals on these topics fit the Company\u2019s strategy and its execution.\n\nThe Strategy Council meets monthly, notably to direct the strategy regarding vehicle CO\u2082 emissions with the Top Executive Team. The main objectives relating to CO\u2082 are to:\n\n- Share the forecast of vehicle CO\u2082 emission average for short, medium and long-term in different countries and geographical areas (especially where CAFE/CO\u2082 regulation exists, such as in the U.S., Europe, China, Brazil, Japan, Korea, India, Australia, etc) and decide on action plans.\n- Share the scenarios related on hypotheses worked out by the Company\u2019s experts:\n  - using internal data related to Stellantis\u2019 current technologies;\n  - using external data related to climate scenarios and market trends (regulation assumptions, energy mix evolution, uptake of electrified vehicles...);\n  - covering risks regarding the supply chain (shortages, climate and health-related events...).\nMake the necessary decisions and approve action plans worldwide (technical enablers, product plan adaptation and strategy) to target compliance, covering the most likely scenarios and reaching CO\u2082 emission targets.\n\nThe range of attendees demonstrates that the CO\u2082 issue is at the core of Stellantis activities and strategy: the CEO is the Chairman of the Strategy Council. Top Executive Team members from Planning, Manufacturing, Purchasing and Supply Chain, General Counsel, Human Resources and Transformation, Finance, Regions, Brands and Engineering also participate. The frequent briefings of Top Executive Team members during the Strategy Councils about climate-related topics such as Life Cycle Assessment or carbon neutrality are meant for top managers\u2019 to be up-to-date regarding climate change.\n\nThe Industrial Committee\n\nReflecting Stellantis\u2019 commitment to embed CO\u2082 issues within executive decision-making, the Industrial Committee has been established in 2021. It provides Executive bodies within Stellantis with a global overview of CO\u2082 issues within industrial activities. This instance validates the mid- and long-term vision about CO\u2082 emissions from industrial activities. This committee reviews all initiative related to the plants to ensure that they are following the decarbonization strategy (for more information, see section 2.6.3).\n\nStrategic and operational decision-making to drive climate risks and opportunities management across the organization\n\nIn the planning division, the CO\u2082 Corporate office is leading a global cross-functional team to drive all the action plans to go towards CO\u2082 emissions reduction and carbon net zero objective.\n\nThe Executive Vice President, Planning holds direct and specific responsibility on corporate CO\u2082 emission average, provides orientation for the development of new vehicles and in particular low-carbon vehicles. The Planning division translates Stellantis strategy into product plans and supervises their implementation by steering the development of vehicle and subassembly programs with the responsibility for their economic performance.\n\nSeveral climate issues fall into the scope of the Executive Vice President, Engineering, who supervises the research and development of low emission technologies as well as the reduction of the impact on air quality of the Company\u2019s technologies and the wise use of material in the vehicle life cycle.\n\nThe Executive Vice President, Purchasing and Supply Chain, is involved in reducing emissions from purchased goods and services since they will represent an increasing portion of the Company\u2019s CO\u2082 footprint. The division monitors the environmental performance and CO\u2082 emissions of suppliers and uses local sourcing as a way to enhance CO\u2082 performance of Stellantis. It also manages the logistics challenges on CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nThe Executive Vice-President, Manufacturing, coordinates the deployment of Stellantis environmental policy for manufacturing and research sites. In addition, the Executive VP manages an annual investment plan that targets plant operations compliance with regulatory changes, while mitigating pollution and environmental risks. In addition to product strategy, which emphasizes the development of low-carbon vehicles, the Executive Vice-President Manufacturing focuses the Manufacturing Division on programs and actions to reduce the Company\u2019s carbon footprint notably through a reduction of energy consumption and an increase renewable sources.\n\nThe Executive Vice-President, Customer Experience, is responsible for the Company\u2019s Quality Policy and the Conformity Of Production of the homologated vehicles, notably their conformity to the vehicles CO\u2082 emission requirements.\n\nThe Executive Vice President, Human Resources and Transformation contributes to the Company\u2019s transition to a low-carbon economy by providing the necessary skills through the attraction of talent, the upscaling of employees and the co-construction of the Company\u2019s future via social dialogue with employees\u2019 representatives. In addition, the Human Resources and Transformation Division is widely developing teleworking and online meetings to reduce the carbon footprint linked to employees commuting daily from home to the workplace or travelling between Company locations. Real Estate assets are also managed to minimize their carbon footprint and their resilience to physical risks. This EVP also supervises the Audit and Compliance Department in charge of the Company\u2019s risk management and internal control.\nThe Executive Vice-Presidents for mobility and connectivity services, have an essential role in the implementation of new mobility solutions and the development of Free2Move and Leasys, Stellantis\u2019 mobility brands, with the ambition to make them the preferred mobility service providers for customers.\n\nThe Office of the General Counsel provides climate change-related, CO\u2082 regulatory updates and legal support to the Company\u2019s organizations. Among other matters, it deals with GHG-related governmental enforcement and private litigations. The Public Affairs Department, under the responsibility of the General Counsel, is responsible for supporting the Company\u2019s interactions with institutions concerning climate.\n\nFinally, across the regions and brands, consistency on climate change is also targeted at the Top Executive Team level, since the Executive Vice-Presidents of the Company\u2019s geographical business regions or brands are in charge of implementing climate action plans in their area of responsibility and working to the achievement of the objectives set by the Executive Committee.\n\n2.4.3 EMBEDDING CLIMATE ACROSS VARIOUS MANAGEMENT LEVELS\n\nClimate risks and opportunities management is shared across the organization. Meeting the climate-related commitments is highly strategic for Stellantis. Therefore, CO\u2082 dedicated targets are annually set at various management levels and according to job perimeters (defined and reviewed during the annual performance review). Corresponding incentive plan are in place to foster the climate performance of the Company and the achievement of the set targets. Individual salary raises and bonuses are linked to the annual performance assessment, which can notably take into account some of the following carbon-related targets for certain employees.\n\n| Organizational Divisions | Climate-related targets |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------|\n| All Stellantis employees eligible for the incentive plans | Annual CO\u2082 emission target is used as a payoff trigger for the variable compensation. |\n| Chief Executive Officer | Annual and multi annual CO\u2082 reduction targets on the CO\u2082 emissions of the vehicles sold. |\n| Top Executive Team members | Targets dealing with Stellantis\u2019 position in vehicle efficiency (vehicle CO\u2082 emissions, new mobility services development, share of electrified vehicles, etc.). |\n| Planning | Short-term CO\u2082 related targets, on the implementation of specific programs aligned with the ambition to reduce average CO\u2082 emissions of the vehicles sold worldwide. Vehicle project managers can have targets based on vehicle CO\u2082 performance. |\n| Manufacturing | Short-term CO\u2082 reduction targets based on improved energy consumption and increased share of decarbonized electricity. Energy, environment and facility managers are operationally involved in facilities environmental management and energy saving and have targets related to energy savings in terms of CO\u2082 emission reduction. |\n| Purchasing and Supply Chain | Short-term CO\u2082 reduction targets based on the increase of the share of strategic suppliers demonstrating a CO\u2082 trend compliant with the Paris Agreement and on the implementation of processes allowing to reduce CO\u2082 emission of purchased parts for EVs. |\n\nThis incentive plan demonstrates the integration of climate objectives in the compensation system across the organization. In 2021, were considered, among other things, CO\u2082 emissions regulatory compliance as a trigger point for short-term incentive program and Electric Vehicle (EV) production and CO\u2082 emissions regulatory compliance for long-term incentive plan.\n\nSee also section 5.1.3.2 for additional information on the compensation policy.\n2.5 VEHICLE CO\u2082 EMISSIONS\n\nCutting CO\u2082 vehicles emissions is the first dimension of Stellantis\u2019 decarbonization strategic plan. The levers on Well-to-Wheel CO\u2082 emissions presented in this section support Stellantis to meet its objective of reducing by 50% its carbon footprint in 2030 compared to 2021, on the Company\u2019s path to carbon net zero in 2038.\n\n2.5.1 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nStellantis is committed to reducing its CO\u2082 emissions in the various regions in which it operates. Stellantis\u2019 strategy is to strive for compliance with Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulations worldwide. As they are by far the Company\u2019s main carbon footprint component, emissions from use of sold products (use phase of new sold vehicles) are at the center of the Company\u2019s carbon net zero objective, which was determined using a Well-to-Wheel approach.\n\nThe main levers for the Company to reduce vehicle CO\u2082 emissions are:\n\n- a LEV mix ramp-up, offering a wide range of BEV and PHEV: in 2021, 10 additional models were launched, and since the end of 2021, a full battery electric variant is offered in each LCV segment in Europe (details in 2.5.3.2);\n- a zero-emission fuel cell offer for LCVs, complementary to full battery models, in order to meet customer expectations (details in 2.5.2);\n- a BEV-by-design platform strategy to be operational from 2023 (details in 2.5.3.2.1);\n- a vertical integration strategy aiming to control the LEV value chain and its costs, to secure supply and quality (details in 2.5.3.2.2);\n- the use of MHEV technologies (details in 2.5.3.3);\n- the deployment of technical levers to improve all key aspects of energy consumption: for example, aerodynamics, rolling resistance and electrical consumption (details in 2.5.3.4).\n\n2.5.2 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nGiven its high stake for Stellantis, resources are mobilized across the company for its electrification: from the definition of the strategy to the sales in all regions, with the involvement of planning, engineering, manufacturing and supply chain divisions.\n\n2.5.2.1. Managing vehicles CO\u2082 emissions\n\nStellantis incorporates CO\u2082 emissions management from product planning to sales. Dedicated tools have been put in place to provide real-time information on the current status and forecasts of CO\u2082 emissions for all Stellantis brands, allowing the revision of production program and commercial policy accordingly.\n\n2.5.2.2. Investment in innovative tech to reduce CO\u2082 emissions of products\n\nTo limit CO\u2082 emissions from vehicles, Stellantis is continuing to develop efficient products by implementing technical solutions whose cost effectiveness is beneficial for its customers. The Company plans to invest more than \u20ac30 billion through 2025 in electrification and software, while continuing to be one of the automotive efficiency front runners, with investment efficiency significantly better than industry average, with respect to total Capex and research and development spend versus revenues.\n\nStellantis uses an internal carbon price to measure the cost efficiency of technical levers that reduce vehicle CO\u2082 emissions. This allows Stellantis to propose an optimized set of CO\u2082 reduction levers on its vehicles based on a cost-efficiency analysis.\n\nPatent strategy\n\nOur patented inventions are a key factor in working toward these objectives and provide us with a strategic competitive advantage. Our technological axis, protected by these intellectual property rights, have as a priority the major challenges of tomorrow\u2019s mobility.\n\nThey include the development of new powertrains that meet our customer expectations for energy transition and sustainable and responsible mobility: engines and transmissions for electrified vehicles, batteries, fuel cells and their control strategies.\nIn 2021, Stellantis published a total of 1,311 patents applications. These patents are essentially in relation with our key technological axis: electrification; driver assistance systems, connectivity and services; vehicle platforms and comfort and security equipment. The research and development budget is distributed based on the priorities set out in the strategic plan.\n\n**Fuel Cell: an additional opportunity in Stellantis\u2019 portfolio**\n\nThrough its \u201cFuel cell\u201d Center of Competence in R\u00fcsselsheim (Germany), Stellantis is leading research to develop Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) technology. The research is built around the following pillars:\n\n- design to customer: LCV market, B2B, Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) centric, shipping volume and payload preserved;\n- design to optimize development cost: right power architecture associated with a plug-in battery and a high level of carry over platform and e-powertrain;\n- global offering: Stellantis/Energy providers partnerships including vehicle, aftersales, leasing, services, energy infrastructure and supply.\n\nAs a result, the Company has launched in 2021 a LCV (Light Commercial Vehicle) fleet equipped with this FCEV technology. This technology combines hydrogen fuel cell and electric battery to provide the energy to the electric motor. It allows Stellantis to place a zero emission FCEV solution, complementary to the 100% battery-electric solution, and thus will attract new customers, in particular those who drive frequently long distances and need to refuel quickly. This version offers 400 km of range at a refueling time for a complete fill with hydrogen of three minutes only, without any compromise on payload and volume. This technology is already available on Citroen, Peugeot and Opel models.\n\nMore information on Hydrogen Fuel Cell is available on the [corporate website](#).\n\n**Use of alternative fuels**\n\nAlternative fuels are also a key component of Stellantis\u2019s strategy to achieve fleet greenhouse gases (GHG) emission reduction, considering that the production of alternative fuels emits less CO\u2082 which can compensate for tailpipe CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nIn close collaboration with leading renewable fuel producers, Stellantis makes sure that products in the hand of customers will be well prepared for these fuels.\n\nWithin Stellantis, the Center of Competence Alternative Fuels (CCAF) leads the research and development activities and is responsible for technological, strategic and application know how on Alternative Fuels.\n\n**Alternative fuels from biological origin (Biofuels)**\n\n- Ethanol flex-fuel vehicles in Brazil: Stellantis develops flex-fuel vehicles (FFV), which run on gasoline-ethanol blends in variable proportions: in 2021, more than 500 000 Stellantis Flex-fuel vehicles were registered in Brazil.\n- Stellantis is also working to anticipate the potential increase of bio component rate like ethanol or Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil, in order to have vehicles that are compatible with future European standards.\n- To support the development of \u201cadvanced biofuels\u201d from non-food resources, such as biomass waste, non-hazardous organic waste and micro-algae, Stellantis has conducted projects such as lipid biofuels from micro-algae in France (PE Shamash project) and in Brazil with the Federal University of Parana in Curitiba.\n\n**Alternative fuels from non-biological origin: non-fossil e-fuels**\n\nStellantis is also actively exploring the potential of e-fuels, synthetic fuels produced from the combination of carbon dioxide and hydrogen from water electrolysis with renewable electricity. The objective is to reduce production cost and prices of such e-fuels and to develop direct air capture of CO\u2082 to optimize GHG balance.\n\n---\n\n1 Production of a methyl ester from the microalgae Nannochloropsis grown in raceways on the French west coast, Fuel Elsevier, Fuel 153(2015)640-649\n2.5.3 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\n2.5.3.1 CO\u2082 performances of Stellantis vehicles: a trajectory in line with the COP21 commitments\n\nThe whole Company is committed to CO\u2082 reduction efforts, from the Engineering Department to commercial network.\n\nA Tank-to-Wheel performance compliant with CO\u2082 regulations\n\nBeing fully compliant as far as such regulatory requirements are concerned is an essential prerequisite for Stellantis.\n\nDriven by the electrification ramp-up and technical improvements brought to conventional vehicles, the CO\u2082 emissions of sold vehicles in 2021 have been reduced.\n\nIn the European Union and United Kingdom, Stellantis has reached its Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulatory targets, both for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles without buying any external credits.\n\nIn other CO\u2082 regulated markets, Stellantis is also compliant with local regulatory targets and aims at ensuring self-compliance without additional credit purchases from 2022 onwards.\n\nSee section 2.5.4.1 for Stellantis\u2019 sales-weighted average fuel emissions and CO\u2082 emissions data by region.\n\nIn 2022, the Company will continue to strive for a high level of CO\u2082 performance by:\n\n- investing in LEV technologies and extending its LEV offer by launching four new BEV and six new PHEV vehicles, and increasing our LEV sales with the ambition to be one of the top players of LEV markets in the future years, especially in Europe and in the U.S.;\n- optimizing technologies that benefit both LEV and ICE vehicles.\n\nThis should allow Stellantis to continue to reach its CO\u2082 targets in the coming years.\n\nA partnership to measure the real-world fuel and electric consumption of its vehicles\n\nAcknowledging the fact that there are discrepancies between homologated tailpipe CO\u2082 emissions defined in CAFE regulations and real-world tank-to-wheel CO\u2082 emissions, Stellantis publishes the real-world fuel consumption figures of its vehicles from the Peugeot, Citroen and DS brands in Europe.\n\nIn collaboration with the independent auditor Bureau Veritas, measurements of consumption and emissions are done on all models of the range of Peugeot, Citroen and DS Automobiles. These measurements are based on a specific test protocol inspired by the \u201cReal Driving Emissions\u201d (RDE) European regulation. This protocol has been adapted to measure real-world electricity consumption for battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.\n\nPeugeot, Citroen and DS Automobiles have launched an application on their websites that enables customers to:\n\n- view an estimation of the fuel consumption data for their model by entering in its characteristics (body type, trim level, engine, gearbox and type of tires);\n- estimate consumption based on the actual use of their vehicle (number of passengers, load, driving style, etc.).\n\nThis application is available on the brands\u2019 websites in main European countries, enabling customers to choose the most fuel-efficient models.\n\nThis initiative was innovative in the automotive industry.\n\nIn 2021, this transparency approach was pursued by continuing to publish the results of real consumption tests carried out on the basis of this protocol.\n\nIn the coming years, fuel consumption indicators will be available for all vehicles in Europe using data from On-Board Fuel Consumption Meter (OBFCM), equipment which has become mandatory.\n\n---\n\n1 Status according to internal assessment, to be officialized by European Commission and United Kingdom authorities.\nA Well-to-Wheel approach for Stellantis\u2019 vehicle CO\u2082-eq emissions reduction targets\n\nIn addition to the existing regulations regarding homologated CO\u2082 emissions at tailpipe, Stellantis takes into account in its reduction trajectory Well-to-Wheel CO\u2082 emissions over the expected lifetime of all vehicles sold, consistently with SBTi guideline for transport sector:\n\n- Well-to-Tank CO\u2082 emissions, with using life cycle emission factors for fuels and for electricity;\n- Tank-to-Wheel CO\u2082 emissions, based on homologated CO\u2082 emissions at tailpipe, with conversion ratio into real-world emissions.\n\nStellantis aims to reduce the Well-to-Wheel CO\u2082 emissions of its vehicles, thanks to electrification roadmap, improvement of BEV efficiencies and continuous improvement on fuel consumption of remaining ICE vehicles, in order to meet its objective of reducing by 50% its carbon footprint in 2030 compared to 2021.\n\nThe hypotheses of the emissions trajectory forecast are calculated by the company\u2019s CO\u2082 experts using internal data related to Stellantis\u2019 current and future technologies and external data related to climate scenarios and market trends. Action plans (technical enablers, product plan adaptation and strategy) to reach Stellantis\u2019 targets are then decided by the Strategy Council.\n\n2.5.3.2 Electrification: an ambitious plan to roll out electric and hybrid technologies\n\nStellantis responds to the environmental challenges associated with vehicle use thanks to technological solutions designed to drive powerful breakthroughs in fuel efficiency and CO\u2082 emissions. The introduction of zero-emission electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles, are poised to enable the company consolidate its position in the low-emission vehicle (LEV) segment in its various markets.\n\nPlacing short-, medium- and long-term quantitative targets on the share of LEVs sales in the total sales mix and on the percentage of nameplates available in a LEV version enables Stellantis to define and track alignment with a clear roadmap of how to attain its fleet CO\u2082 emissions reduction targets.\n\nStellantis electrification roadmap\n\nEach of the Company\u2019s 14 vehicle brands is committed to offering fully electrified solutions. In 2025:\n\n- 98% of the Passenger Cars (PC) models marketed by Stellantis in Europe will be proposed in full electric (BEV) or plug-in hybrid versions (PHEV);\n- 95% of the Passenger Cars and Light Duty Trucks (LDT) models marketed by Stellantis in the United States will be proposed in full electric or plug-in hybrid versions.\n\nBy 2030, Stellantis targets to include a BEV version in all of our passenger cars models marketed in Europe and all of our passenger cars and light-duty trucks models in the U.S.\n\nThis progression is consistent with the objective to grow, year by year, the LEV sales mix and to reach in 2030:\n\n- 100% BEV sales mix in Europe for PC;\n- 50% BEV sales mix in the U.S. for PC and LDT.\nIn 2021, 40% of nameplates were available in an electrified version in Europe and 10% in the U.S. Based on internal estimates, LEV sales represented 12.8% of passenger cars in Europe and 34% of passenger cars and light duty trucks in the US.\n\nGo to section 2.5.4.2 for Stellantis\u2019 detailed sales mix by energy type.\n\nLEV models launched in 2021 were:\n- BEV: Citro\u00ebn \u00cb-C4, Citro\u00ebn \u00cb-BERLINGO, Opel MOKKA-E, Opel COMBO-E, Peugeot E-RIFTER, Fiat E-DUCATO;\n- PHEV: DS4 E-TENSE, DS9 E-TENSE, Jeep WRANGLER 4xe, Peugeot 308.\n\nFCEV models launched in 2021 were: Citro\u00ebn \u00c9-JUMPY Hydrogen, Peugeot e-EXPERT Hydrogen, Opel VIVARO-E Hydrogen.\n\nIn addition, two sustainable urban mobility devices, Citroen AMI Cargo and Opel ROCKS-e have been launched in 2021. Those urban delivery low footprint electric devices, accessible to young drivers, are an additional answer to current mobility requirements, especially in cities.\n\n---\n\n1 Passenger Car only, excluding Commercial Vehicles\n2 Passenger Car + Light Duty Trucks only, excluding Van & Heavy Duty Trucks\n3 Europe 31 = EU 27 + Norway + Iceland + UK + Switzerland\nELECTRIFIED LAUNCHES IN 2021\n\n- Citro\u00ebn \u00cb-C4\n- Citro\u00ebn \u00cb-BERLINGO\n- Opel / Vauxhall MOKKA-E\n- Opel / Vauxhall COMBO-E\n- Peugeot E-RIFTER\n- Fiat Professional E-DUCATO\n- DS Automobiles DS4 E-TENSE\n- DS Automobiles DS9 E-TENSE\n- Jeep WRANGLER 4xe\n- Peugeot 308\n- Citro\u00ebn AMI Cargo\n- Opel ROCKS-E\n- Citro\u00ebn \u00cb-JUMPY Hydrogen\n- Peugeot e-EXPERT Hydrogen\n- Opel VIVARO-E Hydrogen\n\nBEV\nPHEV\nFCEV\nMobility device\nStellantis\u2019 fast LEV mix ramp-up is supported by:\n\n- A pure BEV-focused platform strategy (for more information, section 2.5.3.2.1);\n- A vertical integration strategy to master the LEV value chain (for more information, section 2.5.3.2.2);\n- A charging and energy strategy that aims to position Stellantis in the e-mobility ecosystem (for more information, section 2.5.3.2.3).\n\nThese three levers are consistent and intertwined. Stellantis\u2019s strategy to gain control over the LEV value chain is supported by specific EV-related services from its Free2Move e-solution service entity that delivers charging infrastructure solutions, charging-as-a-service and advanced energy services. This is expected to be leveraged in the BEV-focused platform strategy, which means that Stellantis should have a 360-degree approach to control the performance that it delivers to the customers, both in terms of range, drive smoothness, quality, but also the high level of control of cost and supply.\n\n**DIALOGUE WITH STAKEHOLDERS**\n\nOn July 8th 2021 a 360-degree overview of Stellantis electrification strategy has been presented, including:\n\n- Electrification roadmap\n- Battery in-depth focus\n- Ecosystem of services around the customer\n\n**2.5.3.2.1 The pure BEV-focused platform strategy of Stellantis**\n\nFrom 2023, the sales of Stellantis\u2019 LEV products worldwide will be driven by a 4 platform BEV-focused strategy for Passenger Cars: Stella Small for the A, B and C segments; Stella Medium for C and D segments; and Stella Large for D and E segments. An additional Stella frame platform will be dedicated to the electrified E and F segments SUVs and the pickup trucks. Covering the various market segments and regions where Stellantis operates, these full-BEV platforms should enable high modularity with parts and technology commonality without any compromise on BEV performance.\n\nThis limited number of platforms will be BEV-focused to ensure that the Company has a volume scale effect that is intended to drive the cost competitiveness of Stellantis and therefore the profitability of Stellantis, in order to compensate for electrification costs. Being BEV-focused, they will deliver a significant performance to address the range anxiety of BEVs. The Stella Small for A, B and C entry products is expected to deliver more than 500 kilometers of range. The Stella Medium is expected to deliver more than 700 kilometers of range. The Stella Large is expected to deliver more than 800 kilometers of range. On the Stella Frame, the expected range is 800 kilometers.\n\nUntil the launch of Stellantis\u2019 BEV-by-design platforms in 2023, existing multi-energy platforms will allow to manufacture the latest generation of electric vehicles.\n\nAs a result, Stellantis has the flexibility to adapt to changes in the energy mix in its various markets and can offer its customers a comprehensive range of technologies that meet their usage needs and contribute to increasingly responsible mobility.\nCOMPANY TRANSFORMATION THROUGH THE SOFTWARE STRATEGY\n\nThe heart of the transformation to customer-centric services is the new electrical/electronic (E/E) and software architecture. As announced on December 7, 2021 during the Stellantis Software Day, three new tech platforms (STLA Brain, STLA SmartCockpit, STLA AutoDrive) will be launched in 2024 and will be deployed, at scale, across the four vehicle platforms of Stellantis over the following two years.\n\nSTLA Brain will be fully Over-the-Air (OTA) capable, with 30 modules addressed, versus 10 today, making it highly flexible. It is a service-oriented architecture fully integrated with the cloud that connects electronic control units within the vehicle with the vehicle\u2019s central high performing computer (HPC) via a high-speed data bus.\n\nIt breaks today\u2019s bond between hardware and software generations, enabling software developers to create and update features and services quickly without waiting for a new hardware launch.\n\n2.5.3.2.2 Mastering the LEV value chain\n\nStellantis is increasing its control of the added value relating to low-emissions vehicles, having found a balance between partnerships with expert companies and in-house design and manufacturing.\n\nWith this strategy, Stellantis is targeting to control 80% of the BEV value (without taking into account raw materials) with its joint-ventures (which is more than the share of value that the Company controls for ICE).\nStrategic move to become a leading player in battery cells and modules\n\nGetting ready for the electric future of mobility, Stellantis is going to supply battery cells in order to make sure that it controls what is the most cost, quality and performance-sensitive matter of an EV, which is the battery cell. For that purpose, the Automotive Cells Company (ACC) joint-venture has been created in September 2020 between former PSA/Opel and Total/Saft. In September 2021 Mercedes-Benz AG agreed to join ACC as its third partner. First, ACC gigafactories will be located in Douvrin (France) for the start of production in 2023 and in Kaiserslautern (Germany) for the start of production in 2025 and an additional Stellantis facility is forecasted in Termoli (Italy). The technology used should offer the highest level of energy performance, both in terms of range and charging time, and a lower carbon footprint than that of the competition, setting a new standard in Europe. This project aims to position ACC as a major competitive player in supplying electric vehicle manufacturers with high-performance batteries from 2023.\n\nIn October 2021, Stellantis entered into two memorandums of understanding to form joint ventures to produce battery cells and modules for North America:\n\n- with LG Energy Solution, the new battery manufacturing plant is targeted to start by 2024;\n- with Samsung SDI, the plant is targeted to start in 2025.\n\nThe Company\u2019s EV battery sourcing strategy is to secure more than 400 GWh by 2030. The EV battery and component needs will be met with a total of five \u201cgigafactories\u201d in Europe and North America, completed with additional supply contracts and partnerships to support total demand.\n\nStrategic partnerships regarding e-components integration for next generation of electrified Powertrain\n\nIn order to increase control of cost, quality and performance of electric powertrain-related components, Stellantis has embedded their design and manufacture through joint ventures \u2013 respectively Nidec Stellantis e-motors and Punch Powertrain Stellantis e-transmissions \u2013 but also reduction gears and battery pack assembly.\n\nThereby, new e-components for PHEV, BEV and MHEV applications will be integrated in the next generation of electrified powertrain, from 2022. Innovation activities aim to reduce cost, improve efficiency and compactness.\n\nNidec Stellantis e-motors\n\nStellantis formed a joint venture with Nidec Leroy-Somer Holding in the field of electric motors. Backed by a \u20ac220 million investment, the partnership should lead to the development of a cutting-edge range of electric motors for electrified vehicles. The joint venture aims to meet the needs of both Stellantis and other carmakers.\n\nBased in Carri\u00e8res-sous-Poissy, just outside Paris, the entity currently comprises 240 employees dedicated to designing, developing and manufacturing new electric powertrains to be produced at the Tr\u00e9mery plant (Moselle, France). The powertrains will be fitted in PHEVs and BEVs.\n\nProduction is expected to begin in 2022 and to sustain Stellantis electrification growth.\n\nPunch Powertrain Stellantis e-transmissions\n\nStellantis and Punch Powertrain formed the Punch Powertrain Stellantis e-transmission joint venture. The entity is backed by an investment of \u20ac82 million and will focus on producing the future generation of electrified dual-clutch transmissions (eDCTs) as from 2022.\n\nFeaturing a 48-volt configuration, the transmission will be fitted on Stellantis\u2019 future MHEV models. The eDCT will be designed and developed in Punch Powertrain research centers in Belgium and the Netherlands and manufactured at Stellantis\u2019 Metz plant in Moselle (France), a facility chosen for its cost-efficiency and recognized for its expertise in gearbox production. The Metz plant is expected to have an annual production capacity of 600,000 eDCT gearboxes.\n\nA second JV was established to design, manufacture and supply state of the art components and sub-systems for the future generation of the electrified transmission, the Dual Clutch Transmission (DT2) by Punch Powertrain which is innovative, cost efficient and compact, available in Mild hybrid 48V, plug-in hybrid or conventional variants.\n\nMaterial supply\n\nMany raw materials used for High Voltage batteries are in demand due to the shift to electrification. The manner in which the materials are extracted and processed are often more risky and require appropriate monitoring. For example, cobalt is of\ngrowing interest for the auto industry due to its use in electric vehicle batteries. Stellantis participates in a variety of projects related to materials research, notably to reduce or substitute critical raw materials with other more sustainable metals in high voltage batteries. We are a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative to build capacity in the extended supply chain down through the mine level. Activities to conduct voluntary due diligence efforts are underway with our suppliers. We have used the Cobalt Reporting template from the Responsible Minerals Initiative to begin preliminary data gathering. Stellantis is conducting a due diligence program on these raw material, with a priority on Cobalt and Lithium, in partnership with RCS Global. Refer to section 7.1.4.\n\nTo secure lithium availability, Stellantis signed a binding agreement with Vulcan Energy to supply battery grade lithium hydroxide in Europe for use in electrified vehicles. From 2026, Vulcan will supply Stellantis with a minimum of 81,000 tons and a maximum of 99,000 tons of lithium hydroxide over the five-year term of the agreement.\n\nVulcan\u2019s Zero Carbon Lithium\u2122 Project in the Upper Rhine Valley in Germany uses geothermal energy to produce battery-quality lithium hydroxide from brine without the use of fossil fuels and minimal water usage, reducing the generation of carbon in the battery metals supply chain. The location in Germany, proximal to Stellantis\u2019 European gigafactories, will allow to reduce the transport distance of lithium chemicals.\n\nThe Company\u2019s Tier 1 suppliers are also contracting lithium supply in Europe.\n\nIn North America, Stellantis signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for a direct \u201coff-take\u201d contract with lithium geothermal partner.\n\nBattery recycling\n\nTo make EVs climate change mitigation solutions as effective as possible, Stellantis strives to develop a global circular economy for high-voltage batteries from hybrid and electric vehicles: a re-pair strategy with 21 e-repair centers, a re-man strategy with our remanufacturing center in R\u00fcsselsheim, re-use strategy with second life projects. Engaging partnerships with recyclers is a way for Stellantis to secure access to secondary raw materials enabling the production of EVs. Refer to section 6.1.7.6.\n\n2.5.3.2.3 Charging and energy strategy\n\nAs charging operations is a crucial user experience aspect of e-mobility, Stellantis studies:\n\n- technologies contributing to a simple and seamless user experience: plug and charge feature (easy payment process), high power charging (quick charge for long range journey), services facilitating the charging operations\n- the opportunity to make services for the grid, by the energy and power buffering capacity of the vehicles connected to it: Smart charge functions and Vehicle-to-grid generate value both for the customers and for the energy operators.\n\nCharging service offering related to electric mobility\n\nTo ease the customer electric mobility experience and therefore support its LEV mix ramp up, Stellantis has developed a complete service offering:\n\n- a range of connected services:\n  - Trip Planner and Charging Pass services, to plan a trip and for easy charging at public charging stations;\n  - $Mobility Pass, to temporarily access other mobility solutions if the electric vehicle autonomy is not sufficient for a long trip;\n  - Car Remote, to optimize the charge (charging management and air conditioning preconditioning);\n- new services available at home and in the commercial network:\n  - Private Charging: devices and installation;\n  - after sales: battery capacity certification, adapted roadside assistance, adapted service contracts;\n  - electric vehicle skilled contact center.\n\nStellantis introduced smart charging packages named \u201cALL-e\u201d, providing day to day smart charging offers with green energy.\nA partnership signed between Stellantis and Digital Charging Solutions GmbH, will provide Jeep 4xe or Fiat EV customers access to the digital service \u201cMy easy Charge,\u201d offering them a single provider for the largest charging network in the world. With just one app and one single card, the charging solution will provide access to more than 130,000 charge points in 21 European countries.\n\nA partnership was also formed between the Jeep Brand and Electrify America to install solar charging stations on Jeep Trails in North America.\n\nThe Company\u2019s electric vehicles are already used in many urban car-sharing services set up with communities and private partners in numerous European cities (see 4.1).\n\nFree2Move eSolutions: An active role in contributing to affordable and clean mobility\n\nIn January 2021, Stellantis created Free2Move eSolutions, a joint venture with NHOA (formerly Engie EPS, an Italian technology player in Energy Storage and e-Mobility), with the ambition to become a leader in the European e-Mobility landscape. Free2Move eSolutions has the ambition to support and ease the transition to electric mobility by offering innovative and tailor-made electric solutions for both private and business actors of the value chain.\n\nThrough a digital and seamless journey across all product lines, the scope of Free2Move eSolutions activities will range from charging infrastructures (installation, servicing and operations), public and home charging subscriptions with monthly fee, to battery life cycle management and advanced energy services such as Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) integration and energy management solutions to reduce the total cost of vehicle ownership.\n\nThe joint venture between Stellantis and NHOA is expected to simplify the access to e-mobility and aims to complement Free2Move current portfolio with a new set of offers 100% dedicated to electric mobility.\n\nFree2Move eSolutions also allowed the implementation of projects, such as the introduction of the exclusive Stellantis easyWallbox, an easy-to-use plug-and-play charging unit, the recently launched Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) pilot project and the innovative customer-oriented energy packages. The newly created company offers a full suite of products and solutions for EV customers such as residential, business and public charging infrastructures as well as green energy packages. It enables customers to charge at home and at any public charging point across Europe with a subscription at a fixed monthly rate.\n\nStellantis operates the recently launched V2G pilot project at the Mirafiori plant in Turin (Italy). V2G technology represents an opportunity to optimize vehicles\u2019 operating costs for the customers\u2019 benefit, as well as contributing to a more sustainable electrical power delivery system. Experiments using this innovative technology have started with a bidirectional charging solution, which both charges the car and returns power to the grid.\n\nIn addition, Stellantis\u2019 partnership with NHOA is expected to develop a public Fast Charging network in Southern Europe (before being extended to the rest of Europe and to North America). Enabled by renewables and energy storage, the network is expected to be 100% grid integrated. Free2Move eSolutions will act as turn-key technology provider and NHOA will develop the network. Approximately, 4,900 fast chargers should be installed by 2025 and 36,000 by 2030.\n\nRewarding customers for the environmentally conscious driving behaviors\n\nDeveloped by the green-tech startup Kiri Technologies exclusively for e-Mobility by Stellantis, the system rewards New Fiat 500 drivers in 13 European countries based on their environmentally conscious driving behaviors with KiriCoin, a cryptocurrency that can be spent in a dedicated marketplace. Drivers can check the KiriCoin collected based on an eco score obtained according to their driving style. Analysis of the driving style of New Fiat 500 customers has shown that the best participants in the contest drove up to 20% more efficiently than the average. This has a direct positive impact of 20% on charging costs and on the range of the car. The drivers with the best scores receive exclusive extra rewards.\n2.5.3.2.4 Battery technologies innovation: more energy density, faster to charge, less expensive\n\nBattery technology is key for customers\u2019 acceptance of LEV vehicles since it drives the zero emission range for BEV and PHEV, the charging time to provide a seamless long-range user experience, but also the cost of the system and its safety.\n\nThus, within the ACC Joint-Venture, Stellantis strives for innovation on battery technologies. The technologies covered include:\n\n- electrochemistry and cells design, with a specific focus on the next generation based on solid-state electrolytes;\n- pack design, including mechanical parts optimization, thermal management, wires;\n- software and Battery Management System (BMS) design.\n\nFrom 2024, Stellantis plans to base its electrification strategy on 2 battery technologies to offer a wider range of vehicles, to adapt to consumer needs and affordability constraints. These technologies are expected to enable energy density gains and therefore reduce the environmental footprint of the batteries. This dual chemistry strategy relies on:\n\n- a Nickel and Cobalt Free battery, that should enable an energy density between 400 and 500 Wh/L at cell level;\n- a Nickel based battery with an even higher energy density, between 600 and 700 Wh/L at cell level.\n\nFrom 2026, competitive solid-state batteries are expected to be introduced in Stellantis\u2019 fleet. A first joint development agreement has been signed with Factorial Energy to advance Factorial\u2019s high-voltage traction solid-state battery technology.\n\n2.5.3.3 Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicle (MHEV)\n\nStellantis is extending the deployment of mild hybrid technologies on internal combustion engines.\n\nThe mild hybrid technology combines a small electric motor with an ICE, in which the hybrid technology recovers the energy generated on braking to reuse it for vehicle motive power, thus cutting down on fuel use.\n\nFor a slightly higher cost, this new generation of powertrain reduces CO\u2082 emission up to 15% compared to a vehicle powered entirely by an ICE.\n\nMHEV technologies already implemented in Stellantis vehicles are:\n\n- a 12-volt belt starter generator (BSG) 3 cylinder 1.0-liter naturally-aspirated engine deployed in the Fiat 500, Fiat Panda and Lancia Ypsilon in Europe;\n- a eBooster and 48-volt BSG, on the 2.0-liter turbo of the Maserati Ghibli mild hybrid;\n- a 48-volt mild hybrid technology, marketed as \u201ceTorque\u201d in Jeep Wrangler vehicles, equipped with both the 2.0-liter turbo and 3.6-liter engine, as well as in the Ram 1500 5.7-liter and 3.6-liter applications;\n- a 48-volt mild hybrid technology, marketed as \u201ceTorque\u201d, available in Jeep Renegade, Fiat 500X, Jeep Compass, Fiat Tipo, Alfa Romeo Tonale, equipped with gasoline 4 cylinder Miller cycle Turbocharged engines.\n\nWith a 48-volt configuration, the e-DCT (electrified Dual Clutch Transmission) gearbox, developed with Punch Powertrain, will equip more of Stellantis mild hybrid electric vehicles (MHEV) in the coming years for more information on the joint-venture, see section 2.5.3.2.2.\n2.5.3.4 CO\u2082 reduction: a holistic approach to design vehicles\n\nBeyond the technologies related to engines and fuels, the company aims to leverage all the features of its vehicles in order to improve energy consumption and CO\u2082 emissions. Stellantis continues to develop technical levers that help to reduce CO\u2082 emissions such as weight, aerodynamics, vehicle architecture, materials, tire rolling resistance, losses through mechanical friction (brakes, rolling, bearings, etc.), management of parts that use electricity (sensors, actuators, engines), comfort features (air conditioning system, etc.), safety features and driver assistance features. These levers enable energy consumption gains on all kind of vehicles, both ICE and electrified.\n\n2.5.3.4.1 Weight: the virtuous cycle of reducing weight\n\nWhile we work to optimize vehicle architecture, we also focus on the choice of materials. High-tensile steel is preferred because of its superior strength. However, whenever technically feasible and cost effective, choosing lower-density materials, such as aluminum, composite materials and thermoplastics instead of steel, can reduce vehicle weight. For example, the 2021 Jeep Wrangler features lightweight, high strength aluminum doors, hinges, hood, fenders and windshield frame, as well as a magnesium swing gate, all of which help boost fuel economy. Innovative process techniques provide further gains (heat stamping, laser welding, joining structure, etc.) by helping reduce the weight of the car body while improving resistance to impact.\n\n2.5.3.4.2 Limited air resistance and rolling resistance\n\nAerodynamics and rolling resistance have an impact on fuel and electrical consumption and the Company endeavors to continually optimize these levers. For instance, since 2020 in Europe active air shutters, under-body deflectors, class A efficient tires, lower than 5.9 kg/T, have been widely deployed on vehicles in order to reduce the CO\u2082 consumption for our customers.\n\n2.5.3.4.3 Better management of onboard electricity\n\nReducing electricity consumption in vehicles is a way to lower fuel consumption. The electricity used in the vehicle, to power the air conditioning, lighting, dashboard, etc., is generated by the alternator which transforms the engine\u2019s mechanical energy. The more efficient the alternator is the less need there is for the mechanical energy from the engine and the less fuel the engine consumes.\nFor instance in Europe, the company decided to deploy the following levers:\n\n- optimizing the operating phases of the alternator through an intelligent control system (charge the alternator at times when fuel consumption is lower), lever incorporated into the new generation of engines;\n- optimizing the alternator\u2019s efficiency, with the deployment of ultra high-efficiency alternators (80% efficiency compared to less than 70% before);\n- high charge acceptance on 12-volt battery technology to optimize alternator recovery strategy;\n- using specific Light Emitting Diode (LED) lights, widely on the vehicle lines, to optimize the electricity consumption of the lighting functions.\n\n2.5.3.4.4 Reducing the environmental impact of refrigerants\n\nEuropean Directive 2006/40/EC gradually phases out the use of refrigerants in vehicle air conditioning systems, that provide air conditioning in the passenger compartment, which have a global warming potential (GWP) of more than 150 CO\u2082-eq. This regulation has applied to all models on the EU market that weigh less than 3.5 tons since 2017.\n\nNew types of vehicle produced by Stellantis use refrigerants that meet all regulatory standards. For example, the Peugeot 508, Fiat 500 and Opel Corsa no longer use fluoride gas R134a.\n\nIn order to reduce environmental impacts, quantities of refrigerant filled in European vehicles are reduced. This good practices will be rolled out in other regions. Stellantis also carries out refrigerant leakage inspections in assembly plants to check the tightness of the air conditioning system.\n\n### 2.5.4 DETAILED KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n#### 2.5.4.1 Sales-weighted\u00b9 average fleet fuel economy and CO\u2082 emissions (Tank-to-Wheel)\n\n| Regulated region | Category | 2021 volumes\u00b9 | 2021 results |\n|------------------|----------|---------------|--------------|\n| European Union 27 + Norway + Iceland (gCO\u2082/km)\u00b2 | M1 (Passenger Cars) | 2,541,837 | 114.8 g CO\u2082/km |\n| | N1 (Light Commercial Vehicles) | 446,429 | 189 g CO\u2082/km |\n| United States (mpg)\u00b3 | Passenger Cars domestic | 201,790 | 27.7 mpg |\n| | Passenger Cars import | 25,208 | 32.3 mpg |\n| | Light Duty Trucks | 1,447,313 | 26.9 mpg |\n| Brazil (MJ/km)\u2074 | Total Stellantis | 633,139 | 1.9 MJ/km |\n| China (L/100km)\u2075 | Total domestic | 102,553 | 6.7 L/100km |\n| | Total import | 21,723 | 10.1 L/100km |\n| | Total Stellantis | 124,276 | 7.3 L/100km |\n\n\u00b9 Considering registrations, shipments, productions or custom clearance according to local regulations.\n\u00b2 The European Commission imposes standardized emission requirements on vehicles sold.

The levers presented in this section aim to enable Stellantis to meet its objective of reducing its absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50% by 2025 compared to 2021, on the path to Carbon Net Zero in 2038.\n\nThis section focuses on energy and climate-related aspects of its manufacturing facilities, offices, warehouses, retail operations and other stationary operations. Stellantis\u2019 environmental management system is presented in section 6.3.\n\n2.6.1 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nThe Industrial manufacturing divisions implement Stellantis Environmental and Energy policy to contribute to a decarbonized economy by achieving net zero emissions within its activities worldwide (scope 1 and 2) by 2038. The policy elements are presented in section 6.3.2.\n\nWe are committed to actions that preserve the environment, by implementing initiatives that minimize energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. Such initiatives include using alternative and renewable energy sources, supporting the purchase of energy-efficient products and services and designing manufacturing processes for improvements in energy performance.\n\nThe analysis of our industrial and site CO\u2082 performance showed that the main emissions factors were:\n\n- energy consumption in the manufacturing plants (including processes and building systems) of which foundries and paint shops are main contributors;\n- the electricity source type consumed by the manufacturing plants.\n\nTherefore, Stellantis seeks solutions in its manufacturing processes that enable reductions in energy consumption, with a particular focus on decreasing the use of fossil fuels. This involves an energy management approach that notably maps the energy performance of all manufacturing plants and identifies the areas in need of improvement. This also involves associated short-term capital expenditure to reduce energy consumption. Another lever is to increase the share of renewable energies used by the Company to further reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nEnergy efficiency will play a key-role in our strategy, the main levers to manage industrial greenhouse gas emissions are:\n\n- managing energy use in manufacturing activities (for more information, see section 2.6.3.2);\n- relying on low CO\u2082 energy sources (for more information, see section 2.6.3.3) attributed to:\n  - Green Electricity contracts;\n  - Green self-generated electricity projects.\n\nIn an effort to manage energy use, we are defining our joint Energy Management System which is an integral part of the implementation of the \u201cStellantis Production Way\u201d (for more information, see section 6.3.3). This managerial approach begins with an initial stage of staff involvement at all levels including the machine operator level, targeting the reduction of energy losses during non-production periods. The following stage consists of developing solutions to reduce consumption during production periods. As solutions are developed, best practices are shared and rolled out across the plants. Stellantis\u2019 environmental and energy management policies focus on methodologies and processes related to the optimization of energy use.\n\nAt the end of 2021, the majority of the Stellantis plants were ISO 50001 certified, representing approximately 77% of the Company\u2019s total energy consumption. Accredited third parties certify the Company\u2019s Energy Management System. This management system supports our efforts to achieve a steady and consistent reduction in the environmental and energy impact of manufacturing processes.\n\nThe attainment of Stellantis\u2019 GHG emissions reduction targets is founded on five fundamentals, which are already well established:\nbeing mindful of regulatory compliance and transparency in relationship with administration bodies;\n\n- involving staff at all levels of the organization;\n\n- rolling out an Energy Management System at the manufacturing sites, taking into account ISO 50001 and ISO 14001 requirements and recommending that suppliers maintain similar management systems;\n\n- implementing production methods which incorporate the best available technologies that have adopted low cost and energy efficient processes from the design stage onwards, covering various aspects of production (logistics, maintenance, production);\n\n- employing shared best practices in these production methods to optimize consumption and emissions.\n\nMain levers to reach Carbon Net Zero for scopes 1 and 2\n\n| Period          | Levers                                                                 |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Short term 2025 | - Energy management in all plants                                      |\n|                 | - Energy efficient projects                                            |\n|                 | - Site compression and improvement of industrial footprint             |\n|                 | - Use and production of renewable energies                             |\n| Medium term 2030| - Technical innovations (e.g. Hydrogen, Power to gas)                  |\n|                 | - CO\u2082 capture and storage                                              |\n|                 | - Compensation of residual emissions                                   |\n| Long term 2038  | - CO\u2082 capture and storage                                              |\n|                 | - Compensation of residual emissions                                   |\n\n2.6.2 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nGRI 103-2\n\nEnergy management team\n\nFacilities have a dedicated Site utility manager and a team in charge of the energy management system. They monitor energy consumption, conduct audits, identify potential savings and drive energy reduction projects.\n\nInvestment Initiatives\n\nMore than \u20ac6.3 million is invested in energy savings which is approximately \u20ac11 per vehicle produced.\n\nAll plants have CO\u2082 reduction targets and are required to present roadmaps to reach net zero emissions and present yearly progress.\n\nThe decision making process which allows capital investments in carbon reduction projects takes carbon price into account as well as the alignment with the decarbonization goals.\n\nParticipation in the CO\u2082 emission allowance scheme\n\nEuropean regulation system\n\nStellantis is part of the CO\u2082 allowance trading plan implemented by European Directive No. 2003/87/EC, also called the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) regulation amended for combustion operations (heating and processes) of its largest plants and for one of its casting plants. There are 21 sites involved in the fourth phase of the CO\u2082 emission allowance plan scheduled from 2021 to 2030. Price increased from \u20ac25 in 2019 to more than \u20ac50 in 2021. Stellantis expects a high increase in the upcoming years.\n\nCanadian regulations system\n\nCanadian Carbon Emissions Levy: Federal Output Based Pricing System (OBPS)\n\nA carbon levy program that imposes \u201ccarbon\u201d costs on all fossil fuel-based energy consumption across Canada.\n\nStellantis two Assembly Plants and Casting Plant located in Canada do not pay for a significant portion of their Carbon emissions under an OBPS program design feature intended to protect Emissions-Intensive and Trade-Exposed industry (EITE) and help businesses transition to the program. Unit Costs of Carbon rise every year from $20 Canadian dollars (CAD) (\u20ac13.50) in 2019 to $50 CAD (\u20ac33.74) per ton in 2022. The Ontario Provincial Emissions Performance System will come into effect in 2022. The Emissions Performance Standard (EPS) will charge for Carbon emissions according to the Annual Emission Limit (AEL) is the amount of allowable emissions in tons of CO\u2082-eq for each Automotive Facilities. AEL will be declining from 96% to 92% between 2020 and 2022 and expected to continue to decline by 2% through to 2030. OBPS facilities will have to pay an increasing Carbon Cost for every ton of CO\u2082-eq over the AEL. The increase is expected to be $10 CAD (\u20ac6.75) every year (in line with the Federal program).\n2.6.3 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nVehicle manufacturing uses energy for a wide range of industrial processes including casting, machining, paint curing, heat treatment, etc., as well as lighting and heating of buildings.\n\nStellantis has completed a thorough review of its energy consumption and energy efficiency across the Company. A consumption control plan was developed to map the performance of the largest plants in order to identify the lines of action necessary for a full overhaul of their energy patterns.\n\nIn 2021, the plants implemented energy saving activities, based on the best practices shared between the two former companies. Each energy reduction project is validated based on its CO\u2082 impact and return on investment. Once validated and implemented at one of the Company\u2019s sites, initiatives that prove successful are gradually rolled out to all plants.\n\nThe actions to reduce energy consumption in production processes are described in more details in 2.6.3.2.1.\n\nCOVID-19 IMPACTS ON OPERATIONS\n\nDuring the COVID-19 shutdown period the individual plant energy consumption (gas and electricity) was monitored to minimize the financial and economic impacts to the corporation. With few resources physically at the plants, we created a new process called a Virtual Energy Treasure Hunt, which allowed the Stellantis Energy Teams to identify energy savings opportunities while working remotely due to COVID-19. This remote strategy for managing overall plant energy consumption was completed using remote connections to the utility meters, however we needed to drill deeper into the major energy consuming sub-systems to diagnose where they were in terms of energy consumption.\n\nThe Energy Teams worked their way through each major energy using sub-system, such as compressed air, chillers, HVAC, boilers, lighting and process systems, to gain access to information concerning the idle condition of each of the systems.\n\nGaining access to a full plant non-operating mode such as with COVID-19 presented an opportunity to challenge the organization to push the setbacks in \u201cnon-production\u201d mode beyond their standard levels and thereby generated additional savings and set up future best practice values for energy setbacks.\n\nMany plants achieved energy reductions well beyond typical shutdown levels and set new benchmarks for future actions. These new behavioral actions and adjustments made during the extended shutdown were summarized in a White Paper presented with the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) titled, \u201cStellantis drives Operational Savings during COVID\u201d.\n\nThe Virtual Energy Treasure Hunt was presented to the Energy Star Industrial Partner group in the U.S. Another key strategy to managing energy was to share best practices with all plants including the new shutdown practices learned during the COVID-19 shutdowns.\nENERGY SCHEMES TO CUT CO\u2082 EMISSIONS\n\nLOW CO\u2082 ENERGY SCHEMES\n\n100% GREEN ELECTRICITY CONTRACTS\nPlants: Aspern (Austria), Betim, Campo Largo, Contagem, Goiana, Itauna, Jaboat\u00e3o dos Guararapes, Porto Real (Brazil); Trnava (Slovakia); Madrid, Vigo (Spain).\n\nSOLAR SELF-GENERATED ELECTRICITY\nCento and MOPAR European headquarter in Rivalta (Italy); Saltillo (Mexico).\n\nSOLAR SELF-GENERATED HEAT\nPratola Serra (Italy)\n\nSOLAR ELECTRICITY GENERATED AT OUR SITES\nSochaux (France); Cassino, Pomigliano R&D center (Italy); Kaiserslautern, R\u00fcsselsheim (Germany), Madrid, Zaragoza (Spain).\nPower Purchase Agreements (PPA) signed in Mangualde (Portugal); Zaragoza (Spain) and in the JV in Ranjangaon (India)\n\nWASTE HEAT FROM FOUNDRY PROCESS TRANSFERRED TO A NEARBY DISTRICT\nCharleville-M\u00e9zi\u00e8res (France)\n\nSELF-GENERATED ELECTRICITY FROM OWNED COGENERATION POWER PLANT\nGrugliasco (Italy)\n\nAVOIDED CO\u2082 EMISSIONS\n\n109,099 tons of CO\u2082-eq avoided\n95 tons of CO\u2082-eq avoided\n1 tons of CO\u2082-eq avoided\n16,360 tons of CO\u2082-eq avoided\n2,607 tons of CO\u2082-eq avoided\n528 tons of CO\u2082-eq avoided\n\n1 PPA: Power Purchasing Agreement\n2.6.3.1 Main achievements on GHG emission reduction\n\nIn 2021, Scope 1 emissions amounted to 1,641,028 tons of CO\u2082-eq. Scope 2 emissions amounted to 2,233,459 tons of CO\u2082-eq.\n\nThis corresponds to 0.663 tons of CO\u2082-eq (Scope 1 + 2) per vehicle produced.\n\nDue to COVID-19 and semi-conductor crisis, production levels for 2021 were lower than expected. This situation led to a positive absolute emissions situation. However, results are untypical of a normalized situation.\n\nThe breakdown of GHG emission is as follows:\n\n- **58%** Scope 2 Emissions\n- **42%** Scope 1 Emissions\n\nDetails of Scope 1 and 2 emissions are provided in section 2.6.4.1.\n\nThis graph shows the scopes of CO\u2082 emissions for Stellantis facilities.\n\nPlacing short, medium and long-term quantitative targets on the share of electricity consumed from renewable sources enables Stellantis to define and track alignment with a clear roadmap of how to attain its Scope 1 and 2 CO\u2082 emissions reduction targets. By 2025, Stellantis will use 50% of electricity coming from renewable or decarbonized sources. The target is for the share to increase to 100% by 2030.\n\nIn 2021, the share of decarbonized electricity used by the Company amounted to 2,940 GWh, i.e. 45% of the electricity consumed, it includes renewable electricity (1,170 GWh) representing 18% of the total consumed electricity.\n\nThe share of renewable electricity comes directly from electricity suppliers.\n\nIn Brazil, where the majority of our South American plants are located, around 80% of the electricity produced comes from renewable sources.\n\nThe 1,169,776 MWh of electricity consumed from renewable sources were generated by hydropower, solar power, biomass and wind power and from other renewable sources such as geothermal and marine power.\n\n**A science-based roadmap for CO\u2082 Scope 1 and 2 emissions to reach Net Zero in 2038**\n\nStellantis has defined its CO\u2082 emission reduction roadmap and targets for scopes 1 and 2 in accordance with Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) methodology and aligned with 1.5\u00b0C scenario.\n\nHaving 2021 as a baseline, the target is to reduce emissions from Scope 1 and 2 by 50% in 2025, by 75% in 2030 and reaching Carbon Net Zero, with single digit % compensation of residual emissions, by 2038.\n\n2.6.3.2 Main initiative on GHG emission reduction\n\nThe following sections detail the initiatives that enable most part of industrial and sites CO\u2082 emissions reductions.\n\n2.6.3.2.1 Low-carbon energy consumption\n\nIn 2021, the plants in Betim, Campo Largo, Contagem, Goiana, Itauna, Jaboat\u00e3o dos Guararapes, Porto Real (Brazil), Trnava (Slovakia) and Madrid, Vigo (Spain) sourced 100% green electricity. From the beginning of 2021, a green electricity contract for the supply of Aspern (Austria) also came into force. The 100% Green Electricity contracts led to the avoidance of 109,099 tons of CO\u2082-eq.\n\nIn South America, Stellantis aims to measure, manage, reduce and offset the annual GHG emissions produced from the daily activities of regional plants through third-party verified emission inventory. The Stellantis assembly plant in Goiana (Brazil) was South America\u2019s first auto plant to have neutralized its GHG emission inventory certified by a third party. The plant\u2019s neutralized impact was the result of emissions reduction effort: energy efficiency, use of renewable electricity and replacement of fossil fuel by alcohol and electricity. The remaining emissions have been offset with carbon credits certified by Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The majority of the projects selected were to produce energy from landfill waste and other actions included planting seedlings, recovering environmentally degraded areas and raising awareness of suppliers.\nThe result achieved in Goiana was extended to the 16 suppliers in its Supplier park that became the first multi-plant industrial complex to neutralize its certified GHG emissions in Brazil. In addition, the following Brazilian sites also certified their emission inventories and neutralized their Scope 1 and 2 emissions: Campo Largo and Betim engine plants; component plants in Jaboat\u00e3o dos Guararapes, Goiana and Contagem; and parts distribution centers in Betim and Hortol\u00e2ndia along with some regional offices in both Brazil and Chile. As a result, in 2021, 6 Stellantis plants in South America achieved these results, representing 55% of the company\u2019s plants in South America. Stellantis was also recognized by the Brazilian GHG Protocol Program with a Gold Seal for completing and certifying the GHG emissions inventory. Completing an inventory of emitting sources is a key step on the roadmap to achieve carbon Net Zero.\n\nThe wood furnace in the Vesoul (France) plant produced 16,895 MWh in 2021 (5,596 tons of CO\u2082) by burning wood packaging waste generated on site. This action reduces waste transportation and avoids fossil fuel emissions.\n\n2.6.3.2.2. Low-carbon energy generation\n\nTo increase the share of self-produced green energy, Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) were signed in Zaragoza, Spain (12,000 MWh) and at the Mangualde plant in Portugal (4,000 MWh). These contracts stipulated the installation of solar power panels on the plant premises. Electricity production started in 2021. Photovoltaic panels were installed with the support of the Company\u2019s partners in Sochaux (France), Kaiserslautern and R\u00fcsselsheim (Germany), Madrid and Zaragoza (Spain) plants. The CO\u2082 emissions reduction is estimated at 8,866 tons of CO\u2082-eq per year.\n\nThe self-production of renewable electricity at the Zaragoza plant is Spain\u2019s largest renewable self-generation project. The photovoltaic installation, developed and executed by Prosolia Energy, consists of 19,200 photovoltaic modules installed over a 87,000 square meter surface. The project\u2019s capacity, 8.64 MW, is sufficient to provide 15% of the plant\u2019s annual electricity consumption. Therefore, Stellantis Zaragoza is capable of generating and obtaining its own \u201cclean\u201d energy, increasing its competitiveness in a market of rising electricity prices. At the same time, it fulfills its purpose of reducing carbon emissions, avoiding more than 2.2 thousands tons of CO\u2082-eq. In addition, the Zaragoza plant is certified according to ISO 50001 standards and on the path to implementing the \u201cStellantis Production Way\u201d sustainable efficiency model.\n\nFurthermore, an ongoing project to install photovoltaic panels in the Vigo plant should eventually enable the self-generation of 17% of the plant\u2019s electricity needs. The capacity of the first phase of the project is expected to be 8 MW in 2022 and is anticipated to increase to 15 MW in the future. By 2030, the plant plans to rely on green hydrogen instead of natural gas for some of its industrial processes.\n\nThe Ranjangaon plant in India is a JV supplied by green energy generated by wind power and photovoltaic (PPA) for a supply of 8,500 MWh per year, saving 6,350 tons of CO\u2082-eq.\n2.6.3.3 Main achievements on energy use reduction\n\nGRI 302-4\n\nIn 2021, Stellantis\u2019 industrial activities led to the consumption of 16,058,210 MWh of energy.\n\nThis amounts to 2.8 MWh per vehicle produced.\n\nThe breakdown of energy consumption is as follows:\n\n- 0.90% COKE\n- 6.45% STEAM\n- 7.28% ELECTRICITY (renewable sources)\n- 33.12% ELECTRICITY (not renewable sources)\n- 0.11% BIOMASS (wood)\n- 0.003% HEAVY FUELS\n- 52.14% NG + LPG\n\nDetails of energy consumption are provided in section 2.6.4.2.\n\nThis graph shows the sources of energy consumed in Stellantis facilities. This representation allows comparison with data from other manufacturers in the sector without casting operations.\n\n2.6.3.4 Main initiatives on energy use reduction\n\nGRI 302-4\n\nStellantis focused on energy efficiency projects and initiatives as an integrated part of the CO\u2082 decarbonization strategy.\n\nAs part of the Company merger, we used the opportunity to learn from former PSA and FCA companies by sharing best practices on a global level. Significant energy and emission reduction projects are shared next.\n\n2.6.3.4.1 Energy efficiency in buildings\n\nLighting\n\nLighting retrofits were implemented at numerous plants around the globe and included innovative lighting designs which utilized the latest LED lighting and control technology for enhanced operations. Collectively these projects were an investment of \u20ac4.8 million with a provided benefit of \u20ac5 million. Some of the largest retrofits that took place included:\n\n- Over 10,000 lighting fixture and control retrofits at four manufacturing plants in North America (NA) resulting in over 30,000 MWh/year saved and 7,000 tons of CO\u2082 reduced;\n- Over 7,000 lighting fixture retrofits in Goiana (Brazil) which resulted in more than 3,500 MWh/year of energy saved and 220 tons of CO\u2082 reduced;\n- LED retrofits in Sochaux (France), Torino Mirafiori (Italy) and Pomigliano d\u2019Arco (Italy);\n- During branding image projects, the French dealerships invested \u20ac160 thousands in lighting renovation of car parks using LED and solar panels for an expected saving of 260 MWh per year.\n\nTemperature management\n\n- New Energy Management Systems to control plant wide heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems were added at the Windsor Assembly Plant (Canada), saving over 15,000 MWh/year and 2,500 tons of CO\u2082 reduced. This project provides a \u20ac1.9 million of benefits to Stellantis including energy savings, carbon levy avoidance and government incentives;\n- In Goiana (Brazil), the plant optimized real-time efficiency of the chilled water system through the integration of intelligent and adaptive controls. The project achieved an efficiency improvement of 20 percent. Energy consumption was reduced by over 7,800 MWh and resulted in approximately 500 tons of CO\u2082 reduced.\nInsulation\n\n- Insulation of equipment supports the reduction of energy consumption as for example for the boiler house in Sochaux (France);\n- during branding image projects, the French dealerships invested \u20ac700 thousands in roof thermal insulation for expected yearly saving of 600 MWh and 90 tons of CO\u2082-eq.\n\n2.6.3.4.2 Energy efficiency in production processes\n\nCompressed Air\n\nSince compressed air is the most expensive energy in a plant, we improved our efficiency:\n\n- in North America, new trim compressors were installed at multiple plants and a comprehensive compressed air leak survey was completed at seven plants;\n- in Sochaux (France) with the installation of a new compressor station.\n\nVariable Frequency Drive\n\n- Stellantis focused within this year on improving ventilation and pumping systems by installing variable speed drives in several plants for example in Atessa, Termoli and Cassino (Italy).\n\nProcess Optimization\n\n- Over 750 process improvement projects were completed in South America that reduced 42,000 MWh of Electricity, 17 MWh of natural gas and 6,700 tons of CO\u2082. Most of the energy savings from these projects were a result of plant process optimization and improved shutdown efforts;\n- in North America, process electricity optimization projects in the General Assembly and Body Shop at the Toluca Assembly Plant resulted in over 8,000 MWh saved and over 2,000 tons of CO\u2082 reduced. This project provided a benefit of over \u20ac0.9 million in energy savings annually;\n- beside initiatives on building and building equipment, the major consumer of a vehicle manufacturing plant is the painting process. Therefore we continue to roll out an improved concept to lower the natural gas consumption as we did in Luton (UK), which will take a significant effect in the year 2022;\n- Stellantis improved the heat recovery ratio on the painting Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer (RTO) in Kragujevac (Serbia) saving approximately 16,000 MWh and 1,000 tons of CO\u2082-eq;\n- the Windsor Assembly Plant was recognized by the Association of Energy Engineers (AEE) for the Canada Region 2021 Energy Project of the Year regarding the Topcoat Observation Booth Downdraft Optimization project. Each year, AEE recognizes one innovative energy management project award recipient for this category per region. The winning energy project maximized energy efficiency of the plants largest energy user, the paint shop topcoat booths.\n\n2.6.3.4.3 Company policy or behavioral change:\n\nReal estate footprint\n\nIn 2021, the Real Estate Division continued to work on our footprint optimization for all Stellantis activities:\n\n- Evolution of use principles, geographical grouping of activities, maximizing use intensity, compaction (reduction of 800,000 square meters). Collectively, these actions provided an estimate reduction of 23,000 tons of CO\u2082-eq. Real Estate committees integrate the environmental issues of projects into decision-making processes including improvement of energy efficiency in the major renovation projects of our dealership, financial support for energy retrofits of buildings and the implementation of renewable energy solution.\n- Automotive Trade also conducted energy savings activities to improve energy efficiency. For all French dealerships and Warehouses, energy supervision has been implemented in 2021 to support site managers and share best practices. This also allowed to minimize consumption during the shutdown periods. The French dealership network represents 48% of the scope. Activity grouping, including installation renovation, is the main action to significantly reduce the energy consumption in the dealership network. For example, the grouping of two dealerships in Toulouse (France) in a new building compliant with the latest French Thermals Regulations for new building (RT2012) will allow significant energy savings compared to the previous older buildings.\n\nIn Poissy (France) and R\u00fcsselsheim (Germany), Stellantis plans to develop green campus for the national headquarters that will serve as role models for Stellantis with low-carbon concept and extensive \u201cgreening\u201d by 2025.\nPoissy headquarter in France is expected to group together employees working in nearby sites in a 60,000 m\u00b2 campus. With this project, Stellantis expects to reduce its real estate footprint with a modern, vegetated site, using cutting-edge construction technologies to reduce CO\u2082 emissions;\n\nR\u00fcsselsheim headquarter in Germany is expected to be transformed to minimize its carbon impact with a consistent low-energy concept and extensive use of solar panels on roofs. The headquarter is to be integrated into a historical building, allowing reduced use of resources compared to the construction of a completely new building. Stellantis integrates the great industrial tradition of the Company into its future site concept. The concept also integrates state-of-the-art equipment and allows easy accessibility.\n\nThe initiatives implemented by Stellantis in 2021 resulted in an emission reduction in scope 1 and scope 2 of 49,924 tons of CO\u2082-eq equals to 8.8 kg of CO\u2082-eq/vehicle produced.\n\nThe actions to control energy consumption led to savings of approximately \u20ac9.8 million. These figures are included in the vehicle production costs and affect the Stellantis\u2019 overall economic performance.\n\n### 2.6.4 DETAILED KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n#### 2.6.4.1 Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nNote: Direct emissions are calculated based on the direct energy consumption by applying emission factors acknowledged by the greenhouse gas emissions trading system (EU ETS) in compliance with the decree of October 31, 2012 or European Regulation 2012/601 in the case of CO\u2082-eq and the circular of April 15, 2002 for all other gases. Changes in emission levels are thus directly related to changes in energy consumption.\n\n| Region                  | Direct GHG emissions in CO\u2082-eq (scope 1) | Direct GHG emissions from biomass (CO\u2082-eq) | Indirect GHG emissions in CO\u2082-eq (scope 2) | Total GHG emissions (scope 1 + scope 2) |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Enlarged Europe         | 764,309                                  | 5,596                                      | 959,555                                   | 1,723,864                              |\n| North America           | 760,484                                  | -                                         | 1,163,882                                 | 1,924,366                              |\n| South America           | 65,160                                   | -                                         | 36,902                                    | 102,062                                |\n| Middle East & Africa    | 6,299                                    | -                                         | 20,596                                    | 26,895                                 |\n| China and India & Asia Pacific | 647                                      | -                                         | -                                         | 647                                    |\n| **Total Manufacturing** | **1,596,899**                            | **5,596**                                 | **2,180,935**                             | **3,777,834**                          |\n| Retail                  | 44,129.00                                | -                                         | 52,524.00                                 | 96,652                                 |\n| **TOTAL**               | **1,641,028**                            | **5,596**                                 | **2,233,459**                             | **3,874,486**                          |\n\nThe data provided above has taken into account all emissions from all Stellantis industrial facilities including direct emissions from four cogeneration plants.\n\n1 Greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion of biomass are not included in direct emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol guidelines. The deviation to the NFI is 105,254 tons CO\u2082 of energy and is linked to the energy sold (equals 0.027 % of total).\n\n2 Direct GHG emissions expressed in t CO\u2082-eq. are calculated by applying coefficients (global warming potential) of 298 for N\u2082O and 21 for CH\u2084 (source: IPCC reports, 2007 and 1995 respectively). Indirect emissions are calculated from electricity and steam purchases in compliance with emission factors obtained from suppliers for steam, based on the previous year\u2019s electricity factors.\nThe Company uses energy produced by cogeneration plants managed by two different approaches. In Melfi, Melfi Plastic, Cassino and Atessa (Italy), Sochaux, Rennes, Mulhouse and Hordain (France) plants have signed contracts with external suppliers which provide electricity, steam and hot water used in paint shop process. Four other cogeneration plants produce electricity and steam from gas. The energy produced is partly used in the plant, but a large part is also sold to other facilities or to external customers. The amount of gas used is 1,434,429 MWh LHV to produce 329,405 MWh of electricity and 433,871 MWh of steam. Electricity generated by cogenerations operated in Zaragoza, Grugliasco, R\u00fcsselsheim and Eisenach has a lower CO$_2$-eq content than the national electricity mix from the grid and therefore contributes to CO$_2$-eq reduction. These scope 1 emissions of the energy sold increase the reported absolute emissions even though they were not caused by the production. The CO$_2$-eq from energy sold to external customers represents 105,254 tons in 2021.\n\n### 2.6.4.2 Breakdown of energy consumption from operations\n\n**GRI 302-1**\n\nReported energy consumption is expressed in MWh LCV (the most common unit of measurement). In terms of method, the use of calorific values is recommended by the French decree of October 31, 2012 as part of the application of European regulation No. 601/2012 on the monitoring and declaration of greenhouse gas emissions under Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and Council. The coefficients proposed by these two regulations are derived from the work of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), as are those of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, used as a reference by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Following this approach, values expressed in MWh can be converted to GJ simply by applying a multiplying factor of 3.6 (1 Wh = 3.6 kJ).\n\n| 2021 (MWh) | Combustible energy | Renewable | Non-combustible energy | Total energy consumption |\n|------------|--------------------|-----------|------------------------|-------------------------|\n|            | Heavy fuels | HHO | NG + LPG | Coke | Biomass (wood) | Electricity | Of which decarbonized electricity | Share of decarbonized electricity (%) | Steam | |\n| Enlarged Europe | 561 | - | 3,928,611 | 76,121 | 16,895 | 2,985,282 | 1,759,576 | 59 | 1,034,074 | 8,041,544 |\n| North America | - | - | 4,063,762 | 68,883 | - | 2,742,931 | 1,001,723 | 37 | - | 6,875,576 |\n| South America | - | - | 343,766 | - | - | 589,166 | 156,048 | 26 | - | 69,014 |\n| Middle East & Africa | - | - | 34,699 | - | - | 34,315 | 6,217 | 18 | - | 69,014 |\n| China and India & Asia Pacific | - | - | 1,509 | - | - | 9,937 | 5,455 | 55 | - | 11,446 |\n| Total Manufacturing | 561 | - | 8,372,348 | 145,004 | 16,895 | 6,361,631 | 2,929,019 | 46 | 1,034,074 | 15,930,512 |\n| Retail | - | - | 253 | - | - | 126,519 | 11,053 | 9 | 925 | 127,697 |\n| TOTAL | 561 | - | 8,372,601 | 145,004 | 16,895 | 6,488,151 | 2,940,072 | 45 | 1,034,999 | 16,058,210$^1$ |\n\n$^1$The deviation to the NFI is 7,554 MWh of energy by a transmission error (equals 0.047 % of total).\n2.7 CARBON FOOTPRINT OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN: PURCHASING AND LOGISTICS\n\nImproving the environmental performance of the supply chain is the third dimension of Stellantis\u2019 decarbonization strategy. The levers presented in this section aim to enable Stellantis to meet its objective of reaching carbon net zero with single-digit % of compensation over its entire supply chain in 2038.\n\nStellantis\u2019 responsible purchasing practices are presented in section 7.1. This section focuses on environmental and climate-related aspects.\n\n2.7.1 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nReducing the Company\u2019s carbon footprint includes actions to reduce the CO\u2082 emissions related to:\n\n- purchasing, as the extraction of materials and the production of parts represents the second largest source of Stellantis\u2019 CO\u2082 emissions (see 2.7.3.1);\n- logistics, which represents a small portion of the carbon footprint of Stellantis (see 2.7.3.2).\n\nPurchasing\n\nSuppliers to Stellantis are deeply involved in the Company\u2019s approach to reducing CO\u2082 emissions in the supply chain, including the emissions generated for the production of goods and services purchased by Stellantis. Our strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the entire supply chain consists of:\n\n- selecting suppliers according to environmental criteria such as the ISO 14001 certification, or their capacity to develop products which incorporate green or recycled materials. Currently 62% of direct material suppliers have ISO 14001 certifications available;\n- collecting a status report from its major suppliers on their current and future CO\u2082 emissions and implementing a reduction plan by inviting them annually to participate in the Stellantis CDP Supply Chain program. CDP is an organization which supports companies with the disclosure of environmental impacts. It aims to make environmental reporting and risk management a business norm while driving disclosure, insight and action towards a sustainable economy.\n\nStellantis\u2019 climate change objectives are translated into contractual commitments via specifications and purchasing policies according to two different criteria: the CO\u2082 emissions generated and the type of materials used.\n\n- Regarding CO\u2082 emissions linked to the Company\u2019s purchases from suppliers, the Purchasing and Supply Chain division challenges its suppliers to establish and work according to an emission reduction plan at least compliant with the Paris Agreement and to be aligned with Stellantis climate ambitions. In 2021, 49% of the Company\u2019s suppliers set up a reporting process for energy consumption or greenhouse gas emissions. Stellantis is placing particular emphasis on CO\u2082 emissions linked to some specific commodities covering around 80% of the CO\u2082 emission footprint of the supply chain.\n\n- Ambitious targets have been set on the percentage of \u201cgreen/recyclable materials\u201d. These objectives are also a key focus of the innovation policy that is part of the Company\u2019s supplier certification criteria (see 7.1.5). Furthermore, suppliers also have a key role to play in our commitments on reducing hazardous substances in two main areas: first, the elimination of four heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium) and second, compliance with REACH regulations based on the recommendations issued by ACEA, of which Stellantis is a member. Refer to section 6.1.\n\nLogistics\n\nStellantis\u2019 logistics operations policy\n\nA specific policy is defined to reduce GHG emissions from logistics and identify areas of improvement and actions needed.\n\nThe logistics operations are handled by a variety of external operators and a minority of internal operations, depending on the origin and destination of the goods. The Company has adopted Logistics Guidelines that provide direction on how to\noptimize transport fleet characteristics and apply methodologies to reduce the impact of freight and vehicle movement. Stellantis has established a specific CO\u2082 requirement in its sustainable policy guidelines and has included the CO\u2082 performance as a criteria in its business award.\n\nThe Company\u2019s logistics approach focuses on the:\n\n- optimization of logistics flows regarding network, mode and capacity in addition to the adoption of low-emission transport vehicles in our own fleets to improve performance and minimize impacts on the environment:\n  - make efforts to use the least polluting transport methods available, in line with the most stringent environmental standards;\n  - parts transported from suppliers to Stellantis European plants are pooled in central hubs and then delivered to plants, first for ex-PSA perimeter and then it should be extended to other Stellantis plants. This bulk transport reduces the number of trucks on the road;\n  - the Company is exploring and prioritizing alternatives to road transport by increasing the use of rail and river transport;\n  - contractors comply with applicable legislation and regulations;\n- implementation of emerging solutions and technologies to protect parts and decrease the use of packaging and protective materials to save resources.\n\nEmployee travel policy\n\nStellantis undertakes policies to optimize employee mobility and reduce CO\u2082 emissions related to business travel. This approach encourages a more frugal approach to travel and supports alternatives to traditional individual transport. The Company is committed to limit travel to what is strictly necessary. The Company also focuses on the promotion of remote working, which reduces commuting.\n\n2.7.2 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nPurchasing\n\nMonitoring CO\u2082 emissions and GHG emissions of our supply chain is a major aspect of our responsible purchasing practices. It requires various internal and external resources and is deeply embedded in our management and tracking tools for CSR as well as the decision making process. Refer to section 7.1.6 to learn more about our allocated resources on responsible purchasing practices and to section 7.1.4 for the governance and organizational set-up of CSR management inside the Global Purchasing and Supply Chain Department (GPSC).\n\nStellantis has started to use CO\u2082 performance of suppliers as a key factor in sourcing decisions for raw materials we directly purchase in European supply requirements. In particular, we are utilizing the CDP Supply Chain module as CDP is the most recognized global carbon accounting initiative and has the biggest network and impact. This initiative promotes awareness among suppliers of their impact on the climate, particularly regarding greenhouse gas emissions and provides detailed information on the suppliers\u2019 level of emissions as well as reduction targets and commitments. For more information and data, refer to sections 2.7.3 and 2.7.4.\n\nFurthermore, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and CO\u2082 emissions are major subjects discussed in the Drive Sustainability Initiative, where Stellantis is a partner, as well as in various other Automotive industry groups in multiple countries. Refer to the Purchasing CSR Resources Matrix in section 7.1.6, for more info on our participation in CSR related working groups and associations.\nLogistics\n\nStellantis also created a specific environmental network in the Logistics Department to focus on the reduction of the logistics carbon impact and waste reduction roadmap. This network target is to:\n\n- improve the way of measuring logistics CO\u2082 emissions and waste impacts;\n- analyze those impacts;\n- set up and follow activities to reduce emissions and waste.\n\nIMPACT MEASUREMENT OF THE ELECTRIFICATION STRATEGY\n\nThe increase of Low Emission Vehicles (LEVs) strategy has two impacts on our logistics. The first one is on the sourcing of LEVs\u2019 component, which comes with an increase of our upstream distances. The solution to this impact is the creation of a battery Giga Factory close to our plants already announced by Stellantis. The second impact is the increase of the LEVs weight, which bring a strong constraint on our trucks capacity thus affecting our loading rate on our downstream flow. We are currently working on this topic to find solutions.\n\n2.7.3 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\n2.7.3.1 Initiatives to support the electrification strategy\n\nOver the next three years we intend to expand our electrification plan across all products and all Regions. We want to ensure the availability of our EV products for our customers and that means securing batteries and raw material supply.\n\nWorking with suppliers that are best in class on environmental criteria enables Stellantis, as of 2021, to be engaged in joint innovation projects with 29 suppliers to identify and implement technologies that reduce CO\u2082 emissions of the vehicles as well as in the production of parts. In order to secure the supply of critical materials needed to produce LEVs, it is necessary to have supporting contracts and relationships with our supply chain to procure the needed raw materials which will also reinforce the strategy for emissions reduction. Refer to section 2.5.3.2.2 for more details related to the binding agreement.\n\nIn addition, Stellantis\u2019 electrification strategy relies on battery repair and reuse, which could contribute to reducing CO\u2082 emissions from the raw materials and parts supply chain by decreasing the quantity of materials that needs to be purchased (for more information, see section 6.1.7.6).\n\n2.7.3.2 Suppliers make a significant contribution to Stellantis\u2019 environmental targets\n\nMost suppliers in the automotive industry face the same environmental issues as Stellantis itself, which pushes them to reduce their carbon footprint and water consumption, managing their industrial waste, improving waste recycling and protecting biodiversity. Stellantis involves them in the efforts to monitor our environmental roadmap.\n\nAt this time the manufacturing of BEVs is more CO\u2082 intensive than the manufacturing of ICEVs, principally due to the production of the battery. Moreover, EV manufacturing uses more aluminum to reduce vehicle weight and therefore optimize their energy efficiency and their range. As a result, electrification, although it reduces significantly CO\u2082 emissions from the use of sold products, could lead to an increase in Stellantis\u2019 CO\u2082 emissions from the purchases of materials and parts.\n\nCO\u2082 emissions linked to purchases of materials and components correspond to more than 10% of Stellantis\u2019 European carbon footprint.\nEfforts carried out by Stellantis to integrate suppliers into our CO\u2082 emissions reduction ambitions are based on:\n\n- **the integration of climate change in the supplier selection and evaluation processes**: as part of its responsible purchasing strategy, presented in section 7.1.5, Stellantis assesses the supply base also on environmental criteria annually via the CDP Supply Chain Module as well as part of the EcoVadis process annually. In 2021, the average environmental score in EcoVadis of Stellantis suppliers was 53.4, outperforming all suppliers assessed by EcoVadis, which had an average score of 43.8. In 2021, 2,561 supplier groups were assessed, corresponding to more than 80% of the Annual Purchased Value. In case of insufficient performance or nonconformities, suppliers have to prove their actions in Corrective Action Plans, that get shared with Stellantis and monitored.\n\n- **The requirement for key suppliers to commit to a CO\u2082 emissions reduction trajectory that complies with the Paris Agreement**: as of 2021, more than 55% of our most important suppliers (based on APV) commit to a CO\u2082 trend which complies with the Paris Agreement. The Company verifies their environmental roadmap and action plans. Placing quantitative targets on the share of Annual Purchased Value coming from suppliers with CO\u2082 reduction targets compliant with the Paris Agreement enables Stellantis to define and track alignment with a clear roadmap of how to attain its carbon neutrality target. By 2025, Stellantis aims to have 80% of its APV coming from suppliers with CO\u2082 reduction trends compliant with the Paris Agreement. The share is then expected to increase to 95% by 2030 and to contribute to the carbon net zero with single-digit % of compensation objectives in 2038.\n\n- **The collaboration of all major suppliers in the Stellantis CDP Supply Chain program**: To promote and closely monitor awareness among suppliers of their impact on climate change, 249 suppliers have been invited to participate to the program in 2021. See details on the survey in section 2.7.4. This program allows for a deeper understanding of several aspects including: the management, the targets and the results of individual CO\u2082 emissions of all major CO\u2082 emitting suppliers of Stellantis.\n\n- **The deployment of an engagement campaign to educate suppliers about climate change**: Stellantis considers all suppliers as partners which play a key role to reduce carbon emissions in the supply chain.

Stellantis\u2019 logistics operations are part of the scope 3 emission category.\n\nStellantis is working to define an ambitious trajectory for the carbon footprint of logistics operations that would be compliant with the Paris Agreement.\n\n---\n\n1 Since they represent a minor portion of the logistics flows, internal logistics emissions are included in the scope 3 disclosure.\n2.7.3.3.1 Reducing the carbon impact of logistics operations\n\n**LOGISTIC FLOWS**\n\n**UPSTREAM FLOW**\n- Supplier Tier 1\n- Stellantis foundry sites\n- Stellantis engine and transmission sites\n- Stellantis assembly plant sites\n\n**DOWNSTREAM FLOW**\n- Planning process\n- Forecasts and orders\n- Independent dealership network\n- End customer\n- Integrated dealership network\n\n**PHYSICAL FLOW**\n- Upstream\n- Downstream\n- Spare parts\n- Information flow\n\n**SPARE PARTS**\n- Storage warehouses\n**Actions undertaken by Stellantis**\n\nThis table presents examples of actions undertaken from both companies. The organization to monitor CO\u2082 logistics challenge was completely different, with a consolidated vision from ex-PSA and a larger autonomy of regions from ex-FCA.\n\n| Actions and levers used | Gains/results obtained | Company origin of the action and convergence maturity |\n|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Optimization of packaging and volumes transported with:** | **Waste reduction in new vehicle project:** | From both companies, a new Stellantis standard is under definition to evaluate the sustainability of the packaging. It will be rolled-out for all new vehicle projects in 2022. |\n| \u25aa Use of sustainable packaging | \u25aa The reuse of returnable containers in new vehicle projects allows to reduce waste and packaging are standardized to limit the use of disposable material. | From an ex-PSA initiative, this design to logistics to track the transport impact of parts right from the design phase will be included in the future common specifications for new vehicles projects. |\n| \u25aa Design to logistics initiative to track the transport impact of parts right from the design phase. | \u25aa Technical specifications for logistics (TSFLs) have been drawn up for the large majority of part families and these set out our logistics requirements for our research and development centers. For example, the volume of parts transported for the new Peugeot 208 has decreased by 6% and for new project 3008 it will be 20% compared with the previous model. | From both companies, a new Stellantis standard is under definition to evaluate the sustainability of the packaging. It will be rolled-out for all new vehicle projects in 2022. |\n| **Reduced industrial waste (upstream) with:** | | From both companies, a global policy about overseas packaging and associated waste is based on the reduction of necessary packaging, the reuse of packaging used for shipping and, finally, the recovery if reuse is not possible. The best practices will be widely implemented into Stellantis new processes. |\n| \u25aa Reusing disposable packaging for overseas flows. | \u25aa Waste reduction: the reuse of disposable packaging has been implemented for major flows between Europe and Russia or South America as well as China, South East Asia and North America. Wooden packaging is reused, which reduces the quantity of waste at the plant of delivery | From ex PSA side, new requirements have been set up in the specifications to take into account the plants difficulties to handle the quantity and diversity of packaging wastes. Best practices will be shared in 2022 between the different regions and company\u2019s culture to define a new Stellantis standard. |\n| \u25aa Take into account plant waste management in logistics | \u25aa Studies on plants worse packaging for wastes management are made to save waste cost and waste tons | From ex PSA side, new requirements have been set up in the specifications to take into account the plants difficulties to handle the quantity and diversity of packaging wastes. Best practices will be shared in 2022 between the different regions and company\u2019s culture to define a new Stellantis standard. |\n| Actions and levers used | Gains/results obtained | Company origin of the action and convergence maturity |\n|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Improve global monitoring of logistic CO\u2082 emissions. | Preselection of a CO\u2082 monitoring system adapted to the diversity of our Transport Management System (TMS) regarding upstream and downstream CO\u2082 emissions. The goal is to improve awareness with a shared vision between all transport stakeholders. | From ex-PSA side, there was a monthly monitoring of the logistics CO\u2082 emission with the supplier, followed by workshops for improvements. First, we will use it in Enlarged Europe as a pilot and it will after be extended worldwide. |\n| Exploration of the different solutions available. | | |\n| Innovative means of transportation | | |\n| \u2022 Development of a new autonomous and hydrogen barge project in northeast France, in the Rh\u00f4ne au Rhin canal. | An economical study has been made on this circular river route between Mulhouse, Tremery and Charleville plants. This study shows costs savings opportunities and CO\u2082-eq savings of 4,500 tons/year compared to the current logistic flow. The first prototype will be available end of 2022. | PSA had been contacted by the CEA - Commissariat \u00e0 l\u2019Energie Atomique - to confirm the interest of the project. New discussions are opened to follow the advancement of the project and its possible extension on other flows in the future. |\n| Make Parts Distribution Centers carbon neutral | | |\n| \u2022 Stellantis opened a leading edge Parts Distribution Center (PDC) and Logistics Center in Rivalta (Italy). The PDC distributes accessories and spare parts to over 5,000 destinations and is engineered to to pursue continuous improvement by an approach that seeks excellence and improved service levels and customer satisfaction due to reduced operations lead time and human errors, in addition to reducing consumption of natural resources and energy. | The existing building was renovated while minimizing new construction and land consumption, saving 2,600 tons of CO\u2082 emissions when compared to building on a greenfield site. In 2021, the site achieved LEED Platinum certification. The site uses 100% renewable energy, produced and purchased with 1 MW of energy sourced from about 3,000 photovoltaic panels installed on the roof and side of the building. | This ex-FCA initiative becomes a reference for the new renovation of our logistic warehouses. |\nActions undertaken in collaboration with our contractors.\n\n| Actions and Levers used | Gains/results obtained | Company origin of the action and convergence maturity |\n|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Make Parts Distribution Centers carbon neutral** | | At Stellantis level, the best practices are already identified and shared in business club in Enlarged Europe. This process will be extended to other regions in 2022. We are exploring the best tools from both companies to support our best practices. |\n| \u25aa Implementation of a tool for 3D visualization of the theoretical loading of trucks (Heavy Goods Vehicles) based on daily orders sent to suppliers. This tool was implemented for shipping containers. | \u25aa For the full truckload transportation, the truck utilization is strongly monitored with the target to optimize it, using dedicated tools. | |\n| \u25aa Pooling of flows between several suppliers, milk runs, regular optimization of the uplift frequency. | \u25aa The fill rate of the trucks arriving at the plants is measured and action plans are put in place if any anomalies are detected. | |\n| | \u25aa The average cube utilization rate of sea containers being shipped for intercontinental flows is also monitored and now reaches more than 85% at Stellantis Global level | |\n| | \u25aa The average fill rate of sea containers being shipped for intercontinental flows is also monitored and now reaches more than 80%. | |\n| **Use of multimodal transport** | | These initiatives come from the different approaches of the two former companies and are not exhaustive ones. They will be shared in the 2022 Stellantis regional roadmaps to deploy best practices. |\n| \u25aa Move to more environmentally friendly modes of transport (already high usage of rail transport and sea transport). | \u25aa Reduction in road traffic and corresponding pollution: a regular sea route service between Saint-Nazaire and Vigo (the so-called \u201csea motorway\u201d) is in operation. Thanks to this route, each truck reduces its mileage by 1,300 km, thus helping to ease congestion and reduce polluting emissions. | \u25aa ex-PSA |\n| | \u25aa Multimodal flows are used to transport components between Morocco and the Vigo plant in Spain, through a maritime shuttle between Tanger and Vigo. This mode of transport enables each truck to reduce its road journey by 950 km. | \u25aa ex-PSA |\n| | \u25aa Manufactured in Uruguay, the Citro\u00ebn Jumpy and Peugeot Expert use components from the Sevel Nord plant, which are transported by river from the plant to the Port of Antwerp, instead of by lorry. | \u25aa ex-PSA |\n### Actions and Levers used\n\n| Usage of alternative fuels | Gains/results obtained | Company origin of the action and convergence maturity |\n|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u2022 Utilization of a low emissions fuels | \u2022 Low-emissions natural-gas powered trucks in our transport fleet operating in North America and Europe avoided approx. 2,700 tons of CO\u2082 | \u2022 ex-FCA |\n| | \u2022 Utilization of hybrid vessel in Grimaldi short sea line to our Italian plants leads to 10% CO\u2082 savings on this flow | \u2022 ex-FCA |\n\n| Setting up Gigaliner lorry traffic flows | | |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u2022 Commissioning of a new type of truck, in line with new Spanish legislation | The Madrid and Vigo plants are using Gigaliner lorries (also known as mega trucks).

It will be studied in the 2022 Stellantis regional roadmaps. |\n\n### 2.7.3.3.2 Optimizing employee commute\n\nStellantis implemented a major action plan to anticipate intensive use of electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles by its employees. The ambition is to make employees electric vehicle ambassadors and that they adopt an exemplary, socially responsible approach. This plan supports the shift in usage and behavior related to electric vehicles.\n\nThis action plan triggers the modernization and the strong expansion of the infrastructures to prepare for the increased use of LEVs by Stellantis employees. It resulted in a significant increase in the number of electric charging points within the Company\u2019s facilities. By the end of 2021, 487 charging stations had already been installed at 17 sites in four countries.\n\nThis plan also includes an intensive training program, started in 2019, in the former FCA and PSA with the launch of the \u201ce-Mobility Boulevard\u201d and of the \u201cElectric Quest\u201d, respectively. The trainings have been rolled out to support employees in understanding the changes related to energy transition. A brand new training program was developed in 2021 and will be launched first quarter of 2022, at the global level, to spread the e-Mobility messages across the whole Stellantis population. The learning path will be delivered in four modules in all the regions, with the aim to support employees fully understanding the stakes of the energy transition, the Stellantis offer, its benefits and the ecosystem around electrified vehicles in order to be good ambassadors of electric vehicles. Participation in this program is expected to be significant since all the Stellantis employees will be involved.\n\nStellantis has also a car-sharing solution called Free2Move Fleet Sharing, also used for its employees. This mobility service is currently used by several companies, around 150 shared cars are present in the platform. Thanks to Free2Move Fleet Sharing, employees can book their vehicle between 48 hours and five minutes prior to departure.\n2.7.4 DETAILED KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n2.7.4.1 Supply chain operational emissions collected from CDP supply chain program in 2021\n\n| Number of supplier invited | 249 |\n|----------------------------|-----|\n| Number of suppliers responded | 208 |\n| Supplier Response Rate | 84% |\n| Average score | C |\n\n2.7.4.2 Summary of greenhouse gas emissions per type of shipment (scope: world, excluding JVs)\n\n| (CO\u2082-eq. emissions in tons) | Former FCA | Former PSA |\n|-----------------------------|------------|------------|\n| TOTAL                       | 1,658,462  | 722,885    |\n| Upstream transport          |            |            |\n| Road                        | 619,54     | 410,292    |\n| Air                         | 6,694      | 67,789     |\n| Rail                        | 52,469     | 0,732      |\n| Sea                         | 72,199     | 18,559     |\n| TOTAL                       | 750,902    | 497,372    |\n| Downstream transport        |            |            |\n| Road                        | 694,922    | 170,851    |\n| Rail                        | 116,762    | 6,812      |\n| Sea                         | 95,876     | 47,849     |\n| TOTAL                       | 907,560    | 225,512    |\n\nThis table presents two separate sets of data for ex-PSA and ex-FCA, measured using former methodologies that are different in assumptions and scopes.\n\nEnergy consumption is determined for each traffic flow and by mode of transport by using an emission factor corresponding to this energy (fuel).

Also, employees expect transparency of a forward-looking vision that includes their contribution to the future of the Company and how the Company will support the communities in which we operate and sell our products and services.\n\nThe automotive business and its workforce are being impacted by industrial, economic and environmental transformations. These changes require increased automation, digital transformation, implementation of new production and sales processes linked with new technologies, to design and offer new products and mobility services and address customers\u2019 new expectations. This shift will likely be more suited to address climate change and the demands for a more service-oriented business model.\n\nBased on our purpose and embracing our values, we are working to build an internal organization with local roots, capable of integrating these changes for a sustainable future. By developing agility, we address the changing work modes and customer expectations and lead taking into account the transformations needed to operate throughout the energy transition.\n\nWe recognize that the diversity of our teams is a strength that enables us to seize new business opportunities. We aim to unleash the full potential of our talent, through the promotion of an inclusive environment where we value and respect one another.\n\nWe are cultivating performance, continuous improvement and permanent development with a high level of creativity and inspiration based on positive employee experiences. With meritocracy as a key rule, we recognize and reward success.\n\nWe are committed to promoting safety, health and well-being in our workplace and increasing motivation. By applying a flexible approach, including remote working where applicable, rethinking our workplaces and increasing the adoption of digital and collaborative tools, we aim to preserve employees\u2019 health, in particular if the COVID-19 crisis continues, improving their quality of life, as well as reducing the CO\u2082 emissions generated by the daily commuting and the real-estate footprint.\n\nOn the basis of a constructive and responsible social dialogue, we aim to lead the changes and unleash new expertise in technologies and services to offer competitive mobility solutions to our customers for a greater future.\n3.1 MANAGEMENT OF COMPANY TRANSFORMATIONS AND SOCIAL DIALOGUE\n\n3.1.1 CONTEXT AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\nCSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE #4: Management of Company transformations and social dialogue\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, the speed of digital/software transformation is such that businesses need to move quickly whereas previous technological revolutions, most notably the industrial revolution, played out over a relatively long period of time.\n\nThe changes brought by digital technologies, such as the Internet of Things, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, etc., could be used to bring technical and societal solutions to climate change and customer expectations. The pace of technological change is exacerbating the challenge to offer a broad set of possibilities and business opportunities.\n\nIn this context, the major current and upcoming challenges are:\n\n- the protection of our environment, which is leading the electrification of mobility;\n- the digitalization, which fundamentally changes work processes and products;\n- the globalization, which requires our competitiveness and performance.\n\nThese challenges have already required Stellantis to evolve its engineering and production processes, products and ways of working (such as the increase of the remote working). This approach is expected to continue and accelerate.\n\nStellantis must have a comprehensive strategy that includes a plan to upskill or reskill employees to ensure a professional transition for them. The profound transformations instigated by societal and environmental demands, new customer expectations, the pandemic crisis and the unique opportunities connected with Stellantis are impactful.\n\nStellantis promotes and support to conduct constructive, trustful and responsible social dialogues with employee representatives at each level of the Company. In this way, management and employee representatives are able to tackle the major ongoing and upcoming challenges together and provide economic and social performance for a sustainable future.\n\nA key element for success to guide transformations of the Stellantis business model is the maturity and quality of constructive social dialogue between the Company and its employees, including their representatives. We aspire to improve efficiency, flexibility, performance and continue to grow while protecting our workforce. To achieve this, we understand the need to implement regular communication, a co-construction approach while creating trust and transparency, allow using Collective bargaining agreements to find agile and responsible solutions that will permit the Company to care for the future, in line with the purpose and values of Stellantis. Stellantis embraces a long-term vision to foster social dialogue as a means to achieve strategic goals, Company transformation and competitiveness, engaging stakeholders to seek collective solutions to communal challenges in a responsible and engaging manner towards its employees.\n\nThe shift to a Tech company and the acceleration of the energy transition, are redefining the technology scope of the Company. In Stellantis the diverse competences and know-how from all around the world are a key asset to face these internal and external challenges and support our performance. Ensuring the best level of skills and jobs development is a pivotal part of this transformation. To master these new challenges Stellantis has developed, at the heart of its human resources ambition, a common way to manage competences and jobs, centered around 15 global job families created to identify and develop the appropriate know-how. A job family consists of a set of common skills and jobs with the same business purpose. Each job family split in a specific set of activities called \u201cprofessions\u201d, requiring the mastery of skills, tools and standardized processes. A specific focus is on the skills that are strategic in supporting the core-technology and business strategy of the Company. Within this approach, a global employee collective expertise community, gathering senior fellows, fellows and senior specialists in specific areas of competencies (domains of expertise), is designed to strengthen the evolution of the highest level skills in the most technical and technological domains.\n\nStellantis aims to ensure its sustainability as well as that of its employees\u2019 employment by drawing on operational excellence, performance and agility programs, in a \u201cjust\ntransition approach\u201d. The Company operates according to a strategy of responsible employment with an ambition to anticipate transformation demands for skills, and to boost employability of employees. Implementing a cross and world-wide roadmap of skills and jobs within the Job Family\u2019 strategy:\n\n- will enable the Company to develop reskilling program adapting competencies to the energy transition and new technologies;\n- will attract talents with a global approach covering all the Regions in the strategic technologies;\n- will support the employees in identifying concrete inputs to strengthen skills as individual development plan and new opportunities within the Company.\n\nThis employment strategy is also shared with the employee representatives to strengthen its implementation and ensure full visibility towards all employees.\n\n3.1.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\n| CSR ISSUE | VISION / AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | 2021 RESULTS |\n|-----------|-------------------|----------------|------------|--------------|\n| CSR issue #4 | Management of company transformations and social dialogue | Implement co-construction with trustful and transparent social dialogue with employee representatives and stakeholders to continuously develop and prepare the Company for future challenges | % of countries covered by collective agreements | Short-term: 2024: 90% | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan): 2030: 95% | Long-term: 2040: 100% | 86% |\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nThe automotive sector is going through a significant transformation, ranging from electrification to the integration of artificial intelligence in autonomous driving. At Stellantis, we believe that social dialogue is key to the transformation taking place within the Company, supporting this change in a responsible way and engaging our workforce. Our employee representatives are fully engaged and involved through dedicated meetings and strategic business reviews so as to protect the Company and its employees by managing the risks linked to market changes and regulation. By involving and sharing a clear vision of the current and upcoming situation, the employee representatives are involved in paving the way to a sustainable future.\n3.1.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nThe profound transformation of the automotive industry induced by the energy transition, digital innovation and societal expectations is creating a strong demand for attention and protection by employees and stakeholders potentially impacted. In this context, social dialogue and workforce strategy are essential to prevent social risks, anticipate transitions, seek remedial solutions and to improve the Company\u2019s reputation towards internal as well as external stakeholders. We strive to make the Company a place that protects employees and their future and ensures high standards of decent work, respect for individual rights and social progress.\n\nWe believe that social dialogue can support economic development by providing an enabling environment for sustainable enterprise development. The trust-based relationships created by social dialogue reduce the risk of social conflict and create the stability necessary to ensure continued production and investment. They are a basis for the competitiveness and sustainable success of our Company.\n\nCorporate Social Governance (CSR) or Environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) stands out as a differentiating factor for our Company. More than a voluntary process and a legal obligation, ESG is a powerful lever for engagement among our employees. What\u2019s more, ESG becomes a concrete path for promoting the purpose and values of Stellantis among employees. The current health crisis underlines the importance of Stellantis work so far to build a more sustainable and resilient company. The unprecedented COVID-19 situation that we have been going through for more than one year also offers an unprecedented opportunity to construct a more inclusive and diversified company.\n\nSocial relations and workforce management are one of the key success factors for involving and engaging the employees in an ESG process.\n\nAgainst this background, risks and opportunities were identified.\n\n3.1.3.1 Risks\n\n- Regulations and industry are creating unprecedented requirements for specialized talent, for example related to CO\u2082 and Cybersecurity;\n- operational risks:\n  - lack of availability of specialized skills, skills assessment and inventory;\n  - lack of attractiveness and swift at enriching the Company with new competences needed for the coming challenges;\n  - decisions to conclude the working relationship with employees that are not aligned with the market-led and regulatory transformations of the Company, can cause social issues (e.g., social demonstrations, complaints provided by employee representatives);\n  - not having the support from social partners, the speed of transformations could be hampered, which is key to lead the way the world moves.\n\nThreat to our reputation in the event of strikes, social movements, dismissals, legal actions, employee unsatisfaction, etc. as a result not achieving the changing needs of the operational merger implementation and synergies execution. (e.g. department definition and boundaries).\n\n3.1.3.2 Opportunities\n\n- Availability of skills and competencies:\n  - making best use of the existing Human Capital with a strong skills background and recruit in game-changing new fields.\n- Diversity of skills, engine to power the transformations:\n  - Contribute to the global distribution of competencies, with the new way of working (New Era of Agility), by having the right skills at the right time and place to support the business strategies of the Company.\n- Innovative social dialogue:\n  - co-construction through innovative Collective Bargaining Agreement;\n  - reassuring on the Company\u2019s ability to manage transformation through social dialogue in order to facilitate its relationships with unions and public authorities.\n- Implementation of our purposes \u201cwinning together\u201d and \u201ccaring for the futures\u201d, both for the employees and the Company.\n- The highly competitive, committed and well-balanced team from the merger leverages its combined skills and diverse backgrounds to guide Stellantis to become a great Company.\nIMPACT MEASUREMENT OF THE ELECTRIFICATION STRATEGY\n\nOur electrification process relies on a strong inclusive strategy, among others battery repair and reuse. It will create workforce opportunities for our five gigafactories managed through dedicated Joint Ventures, 21 e-repair centers, and a battery expertise center in R\u00fcsselsheim, Germany. These new opportunities will be used to ensure the workforce transition from Internal Combustion Engine vehicles (ICE) to Electric Vehicles (EVs). Stellantis is supporting this workforce transition by training and offering skill enhancement to employees to assist them with their chosen professional paths internally or externally.\n\nBeing transparent about the impact of the electrification transition with our workforce is key to our continuing transformation. Stellantis integrates the electrification impact and strategy in the meeting agendas of international social dialogue bodies and local representative bodies. The purpose is to share the analysis of various scenarios of technology development including the fuel mix shift and managing the impact on engine and gearbox manufacturing activities. Sharing the electrification strategy with the social partners strengthens workforce understanding and the acceptance of the Company\u2019s transformations related to the energy transition. Several local collective agreements supporting the performance and the transition were signed in 2021. The objective is to ensure a responsible transition, including employee well-being policy, which protects the Company and employees in a sustainable way.\n\nVehicle electrification is vital to keep the pace with evolving regulatory requirements, including recent announcements from some countries on bans for internal combustion engine vehicles and the climate change. On July 8, 2021, Stellantis disclosed the intensification of electrification with clear paths, investments and programs. Under this context, the labor relationship and workforce are impacted and for that reason Stellantis will anticipate through the following actions:\n\n- dialogue with employees and with employee representative institutions to communicate, support and anticipate the transformation;\n- create conditions for employees to develop competencies;\n- anticipate the needs of skills to fulfill the operational objectives;\n- reskill employees to fit with the emerging skill technologies;\n- manage both the industrial footprint and acquiring of new technologies.\n\n3.1.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nStellantis has adopted a global operating model, with responsibilities at both local and corporate level. In this way, local needs are taken into account, while at the same time consistent and cohesive actions are taken.\n\nFor human resources and labor relations at Stellantis, the Chief Human Resources and Transformation Officer sets and enforces a global strategy. The Stellantis Social Relation strategy is approved by the Top Executive team. For more information, see section 3.1.5.\n\nThe Chief Human Resources and Transformation Officer is involved in strategic decisions in order to take the human factor into account. This is a necessary condition to establish a quality and proactive social dialogue.\n\nBy finding the right balance between corporate and local, the global operating model supports further integration of diversity in the Company. Local collective agreements are led by the regions and/or countries which take the global Company policies into account and reflect local particularities. To get a global social overview, a social climate monitoring was implemented in each region/country with the objective to give insight\u2019s, create a better common understanding and allows forecasting on a corporate level and define further action plan if needed. Each month, representatives from about 30 countries participate to a poll and share about working rhythm and atmosphere, manufacturing and sales activities, Unions activities and local policies. These criteria enable sharing the state of the social climate from within the workforce to allow for actionable planning and preparedness. Global guidance is given at the corporate level on the Company strategy, Purposes and Values, Diversity and Inclusion strategy, etc. and regional specificities are integrated in local agreements.\n\nCo-construction is the approach promoted by the Company to build a responsible relationship based on trust and transparency and aimed at reconciling economic and social performance by implementing the most appropriate and pragmatic solutions. With this objective in mind, an active dialogue has been maintained in 2021 with the various employee representation bodies existing at national or transnational level, notably in Europe through the European Works Councils of PSA, Fiat and Opel-Vauxhall or in North Americas UAW (US union) or Unifor (Canadian union) whose mandates are respected. Plus we conduct global events to share communications and strategies when appropriate prior to releasing the information, such as the preview of\nthe presentation of the Stellantis purpose and values. Goals are monitored and assessed on an ongoing basis, Stellantis has implemented a structured system involving local general management, HR management and employee representatives.\n\nThe Chief Human Resources and Transformation Officer is responsible for the oversight of the Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining. He is a member of the Strategy Council and the owner of the strategic ESG issue/challenge \u201cManagement of company transformations and social dialogue\u201d.\n\nThe approach of co-construction through social dialogue is held as a competitive advantage for the Company in a more and more demanding environment. The notice period provided to employees and their elected representatives regarding significant operational changes is regulated either by local legislation or through collective bargaining agreement. The company fully complies with both legislation and Collective Bargaining Agreements. Stellantis promotes and implements exchange with social partners regarding any significant operational changes to find the most appropriate way out in a responsible manner.\n\nAs part of this policy the Freedom of Association is respected, protects and promotes the fundamental labor rights of their employees namely, and the right to collective bargaining.\n\n- **Freedom of Association**: free exercise of the right to organize the efficiency of this organization is represented by 91.5% of employees who are represented by trade unions or employee representatives - We endorse, among other declarations, the United Nations (\u201cUN\u201d) declaration on human rights and the International Labor Organization declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work.\n\n- **87% of the workforce are covered by collective agreement.**\n\n**Employees Covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement**\n\n(Stellantis worldwide)\n\n| Year | Number of employees covered | % of employees covered |\n|------|-----------------------------|------------------------|\n| 2021 |                             |                        |\n| Blue collars | 182,173 | 97% |\n| White collars | 58,952 | 65% |\n| Total | 241,125 | 87% |\n\n1 Country with more than 150 employees\n\nThe Company aims to have relevant employee representatives bodies at all levels (Global, Regional, Local) enabling to share implementation of the Company\u2019s strategic plan across all regions and to conduct an efficient dialogue with employee representatives.\n\n**As well as social dialogue, the Job Family and skills strategy have been implemented and lead by the Chief Human Resources and Transformation Officer to ensure a transversal skills and job management.**\n\nThe Job Family approach provides a worldwide and cross-functional jobs and skills foundation for Stellantis, which is fully integrated with talent management and learning policies. This foundation of jobs and skills is based on internal and external data. Through Human Resources analytics facilitation, job roles and required skills are customized and finally validated by a Job Family and Human Resources stakeholders network.\n\nAs described above a job family consists of a set of common skills and jobs with the same business purpose. Each job family split in a specific set of activities called \u201cprofessions\u201d, requiring the mastery of skills, tools and standardized processes. All employees are assigned to a profession and a Job Family allowing a job and skills driven mapping, cross-functional to the organization.\n\nAs a key asset of the Job Family approach is the set up of a global employee collective expertise community, gathering senior fellows, fellows and senior specialists in specific areas of competencies (domains of expertise), designed to strengthen the evolution of the highest level skills in the most technical and technological domains.\n\nThis Community, managed together with the Chief Technology Officer, has the aim of:\n\n- concretely act for strengthening the best technical know how in the Company, ensuring the proper development of the most technical domains;\n- being the point of reference for supporting our Company performance, becoming the \u201cgo-to person\u201d to find the most efficient and innovative solutions;\n- developing the ability in forecasting changes to secure sustainability for the business;\n- building a world-wide expertise network, powered by Stellantis diversity, with an inclusive environment in which providing value to the whole innovative ideas and know how.\nIMPACT MEASUREMENT OF THE ELECTRIFICATION STRATEGY\n\nFrom the very beginning of the creation of Stellantis, the electrification strategy is a highly relevant topic shared with the social partners to share the challenges and the consequence of the energy transition with the willingness to have a common understanding and the construction of the path to achieve this challenging transition.\n\nRegarding the skills management, the anticipation of future needs is a critical element. The Job Family approach and expertise network is an answer to manage the required operations and ensure a leadership position within the automotive industry.\n\nFurthermore a budget has been allocated to retrain or reskill people who used to have jobs no longer pursued.\n\nExample: Dedicated negotiation to ensure an efficient transition for employees between Stellantis and Automotive Cells Company (ACC). ACC is dedicated to the manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles in Europe.\n\nA qualification concept for all employees working in battery-cell and -module production will be developed and deployed.\n\n3.1.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nStellantis social relations strategy is based on six commitments:\n\n- Stellantis upholds the United Nations declaration on human rights and supports decent work and a more equitable work environment;\n- Stellantis is committed to complying with all applicable labor laws and regulations and aims to apply best practices in human resources management;\n- Stellantis bases social dialogue on relationships with independent labor unions and employee representatives and seeks workplace cooperation;\n- Stellantis is engaged in collective bargaining agreement to find pragmatic, inclusive and protective agreements;\n- Stellantis fosters social dialogue by managers in the field on a daily basis;\n- Stellantis monitors social indicators in all subsidiaries and globally discloses in a transparent manner to its stakeholders.\n\nStellantis is committed to enacting a high-quality collective agreements strategy, based on a sound understanding of the Company, seeking out innovative solutions and demonstrating a capacity to reconcile the Company\u2019s economic and social challenges. In 2021, 467 collective agreements were signed worldwide and 97% of Company blue-collar workers are covered by a collective bargaining agreement at sectoral and/or Company level. Stellantis adopts an open approach to communicate with employees in countries where there is not an obligation for trade union implementation. As an example, in China, the mechanism of Voice of Employees (VOE) has been set up to work as a proactive bridge between employees and management. VOE representatives are consulted by the management over all important employee-related policy matters. VOE representatives communicate to China employees about Stellantis strategies and latest news and disclosures. What\u2019s more, they contribute to enhance both employees and company mutual development. It represents an efficient channel of constructive communication and helps implementing major action plans in the Region.\n\nThis employee relations strategy is in force at our Company sites. It is an important component for Stellantis aims to anticipate and support the Company\u2019s transitions by incorporating the human dimension, consequently helping to create a harmonious labor environment. No major strikes took place within Stellantis in 2021 according to the definition of SASB-310a.2. In total 13 strike events occurred corresponding to 13 days focused on two locations (Kragujevac (Serbia) 12 events for 12 days and Kenitra (Morocco) 1 event for 1 day). Stellantis has implementing a proactive process through an active dialog with the social partner to prevent strike or social demonstration. Additionally, in Serbia there are ongoing discussion between employee representative, management, labor minister with a mediator support. And in Kenitra an agreement was signed with employee representatives with regard to bank of hours payment.\nStellantis has a strong commitment to fundamental human rights, based both on the principles formulated in the \u201cPSA Global Framework Agreement on Social Responsibility\u201d (GFA) and in the \u201cFCA human rights guidelines\u201d. In 2021, the Company continued strongly to exercise vigilance in this area within its various activities and subsidiaries, by carrying out internal audits and monitoring the application of the GFA. In addition, we have begun working to define a merged framework of human rights principles and tools for their adoption and control. **Stellantis promotes the respect of human rights in every host country.** The policy aims at addressing and resolving issues also with regard to subsidiaries which are part of the Company\u2019s duty of vigilance. The Guidelines for Suppliers and Stellantis Human Rights Policy are consistent with the spirit and intent of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Companies, the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of the International Labor Organization (ILO), the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Modern Slavery Act 2015. As **supporter of the UN Global Compact and the ILO Principles**, Stellantis embarks environmental and societal impacts in all its decision-making processes in a 360-degree approach.\n\nStellantis on Social Responsibility has the willingness to formalize the Company\u2019s commitments to its stakeholders in a detailed and public manner and shares its social requirements with suppliers, subcontractors, industrial partners and dealer networks. **Stellantis goes beyond simply complying with local and national standards and to work within a recognized framework for fundamental human rights.**\n\n### 3.1.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\n**GRI 103-2**\n\nAs part of the Human Resources and Transformation division, a dedicated department to the workforce and labor relations has been created at corporate level to lead and coordinate the Employment and Social relations strategy for Stellantis. A similar organization structure has been implemented at regional level to increase coordination and efficiency.\n\nThe main resources involved in this labor relation strategy are:\n\n- training hours to the managers including dedicated to the Code of Conduct and Human Rights;\n- time given to employee representatives as part of their mission;\n- time for negotiation with the social partners.\n\nOutcomes in return are valuable:\n\n- helps manage disruption and preserve employment;\n- supports productivity and performance;\n- supports fairness and adherence;\n- conflict prevention or resolution;\n- enhances employee engagement and social cohesion.\n\n**Regarding the management of the skills Stellantis has implemented a Job Families strategy.**\n\nAgainst this background, specific roles for the Job Families allow a robust governance and deliverables as described above.\n\n**Strategic skills management**\n\n- Mapping of strategic skills that support the core-technology and business strategy of the Group;\n- Steering of needs ramp up workforce and training. Monitoring of the footprint;\n- Monitoring of replacement plans.\n\n**Job mapping/catalog**\n\n- Optimum job mapping structured by Job Family and Professions with common grading for \"manager\" level;\n- Jobs for Staff and Workers assigned to Professions;\n- Managed with Grading corporate HR.\nTechnical skills:\n- Shared library of technical skills;\n- Technical skills assessment integrated into the talent management process;\n- Skills sets predefined by job clusters (facilitated by AI tools);\n- Upskilling steering;\n- Link with the learning offer and technical training content with training academies.\n\nExpertise network:\n- A worldwide senior technical specialist, fellow and senior fellow network;\n- Structured around competency domains defined by need (Job Families);\n- Mission and deliverables expected increasing by level;\n- Dedicated technical career path to attract internal and external talents.\n\nKey jobs and typical career paths:\n- Key jobs for Stellantis are identified and characterized by the Job Families to ensure its cross-functional steering;\n- Examples of typical career path are provided for key jobs.\n\nFuture needs: skills and jobs\n- Major trends of skills and job changes identified by the Job Families as a worldwide approach to anticipate changes and bring guidance on the main upskilling and reskilling challenges;\n- With a self-learning approach, the most agile learners can self-assess their skills and capabilities, access learning resources and opportunities and track their achievements. Through this, new capabilities needed for projects, assignments or roles can be acquired fast and tracked easily.\nTo ensure the deployment of the Job Families strategy a proper governance is set up with key stakeholders:\n\n- the sponsor who validate the vision, the Job family manager who provide orientation to this vision defining priorities and validating proposals;\n- the profession managers who identify and build the concrete proposals related to main processes; and\n- the HR job family who coordinate and support the whole processes. To reflect Stellantis matrix organization specific local contacts in the regions are steered by the stakeholders.\n\nStellantis strives to have in each industrial site its own site project aimed at sustainable performance, supported by a collective performance agreement co-constructed with the social partners. The projects are planned, reported and shared with all sites and social partners.\n\n### COMPANY TRANSFORMATION THROUGH THE SOFTWARE STRATEGY\n\nOur software strategy is supported by a dedicated Software Division to operate the shift to become a sustainable mobility tech company.\n\nStellantis intends to create a software and data academy to retrain more than 1,000 internal engineers in multiple roles and develop its software community. The Company has a plan to hire top software and AI talent from technology and other industries globally.\n\nBy 2024, Stellantis targets having 4,500 efficiency-driven software engineers, creating talent hubs around the globe. Those engineers are expected to help achieve the execution of Stellantis\u2019 software ambitions.\n\n### 3.1.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nOne initiative that makes it easier for the Company to comply with Human Rights as well as its Diversity and Inclusion commitments and Well-being, Health and Safety policy is the **Stellantis Integrity Helpline**. Stellantis worked with two very similar whistleblowing systems from former Groupe PSA and FCA, which have been merged into one in November 2021. The **Whistleblowing system ensures that any violation of Stellantis compliance rules can be reported and received securely and confidentially and processed and managed properly**. This system is open to employees, suppliers and other stakeholders (for more information, see section 5.1.4.1). The Company expects that all persons in the workplace will be treated with dignity, their rights respected and their privacy maintained. One category of reporting addresses the violation of fundamental Human Rights. Our whistleblowers are briefed on following examples of cases that can be reported: discrimination, harassment, racism, sexism, xenophobia and homophobia; disrespectful behavior and sexual harassment; lack of respect for private life; threat, violence or infliction of injuries or other physical or psychological harm to a person; unequal treatment due to gender, religion, ethnicity or beliefs; breach of human rights such as forced labor, child labor, restriction of the freedom of association, illicit employment, working hours violations; violations of occupational health and safety regulations and lack of employee protection.\n\nEach report triggers an internal investigation. The investigations are conducted with neutrality and respect in order to check and verify the facts. These behaviors are liable to disciplinary measures that have been set in every country to prevent any form of misconduct. Reports may be made anonymously unless local law provides otherwise. These systems allow vigilance over the Company\u2019s \u201cimpacts\u201d on its stakeholders. Thus, in 2021, 1,077 issues have been reported via the Stellantis Integrity Helpline. All cases are investigated via the Company\u2019s disciplinary and grievance procedure. An investigation is carried out systematically with actions taken on the basis of the conclusions.\n\nAll employee representatives can exercise vigilance and can report non-compliance, and their opinion is regularly solicited on the application of the agreement\u2019s commitments. Stellantis is committed to handling claims and complaints that are raised and ensuring due diligence with suppliers in the supply chain (for more information, see section 7.1.5).\nCompany transformation\n\nSince the merge of PSA and FCA at the very beginning of 2021, Stellantis started dialogues with employee representatives and promotes both contractual and constructive approach. The Company operates according to a policy of responsible and sustainable employment, and it aims to anticipate transformations and reinforce employees\u2019 employability by offering different paths such as reskilling and upskilling programs to safeguard careers. The implementation of the Job Families mapping for Stellantis facilitates the needs identification for the core skills required for the professions and the business but also to anticipate and monitor the mapping of people and skills over the strategic activities related to electrification, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and data, robotics and automation, etc.\n\nAn example of a training project in the manufacturing perimeter related to strategic skills for the Industrial Handling and Automation profession: \u201cDigital Twin\u201d.\n\nThis project is carried out in partnership with a provider in this technical field and with the \u201cPlateforme Fran\u00e7aise de l\u2019Automobile\u201d (PFA), Center of the Automotive Industry in France. The deliverable is a world first in this sector: a virtual platform used for training in plants. This new way of learning is powerful, as it allows to see, to understand and learn in many different use cases (faults simulation, identification, analysis, diagnosis, how to restart a cycle,\u2026), without having to use or disturb the real production facilities. In 2021, after successful use tests, all French maintenance people and PSP (Production System Pilots) in a first plant have been trained. The solution adapts to different types of installations and can therefore be deployed in other plants.\n\nWORKFORCE DESCRIPTION\n\nWorkforce distribution by reportable segment\n2021 (% and number of employees)\n\n- 1% Maserati 1,538\n- 1% China and India & Asia 3,893\n- 2% Middle East & Africa 5,698\n- 9% South America 26,019\n- 4% Other 12,357\n\nWorkforce distribution by geographic area\n2021 (% and number of employees)\n\n- 2% Middle East & Africa 5,983\n- 10% South America 29,352\n- 32% North America 91,289\n- 50% Enlarged Europe 142,078\n- 1% China and India & Asia 4,764\n- 54% Enlarged Europe 150,807\n\n1 Includes 2,101 employees representing 0.7 percent of the total headcount, even if they belong to legal entities that are not managed within the HR consolidation tool that are not considered in other workforce KPIs.\n2 All outside Automotive division\nOrganization of working hours\n\nIn every host country, working hours are equal to or less than the legal work week or industry practices.\n\nStellantis has implemented flexible working hours initiatives, also known as banks of hours, in most countries with industrial or logistics facilities.

In order to face ongoing societal, environmental, technological, and industrial changes, we are focusing on evolving our talent practices to further enable us to ensure we can drive the transformation of our Company. We are utilizing the international footprint of Stellantis and the diversity of talent it provides to refine our talent management activities to cultivate the skills and capabilities necessary for continued success in an agile and effective way. We are continuing to build on our performance through talent processes and practices that unleash the potential of our workforce. Through our performance, continuous improvement, and permanent development, we attract and retain talent with the capabilities required for our success. To further engage and motivate our team, meritocracy is at the center of our strategy and we recognize and reward success.\n\nThe merger of PSA and FCA required the coordination of both learning strategies. By organizing workshops with representatives of the learning community, Stellantis redefined its path by taking the best from each company. Most of the new programs, including the global tenders, are the result of this process Stellantis learning strategy is in line with the global operating model, taking into account local needs, while at the same time measures are consistent and cohesive.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nThe Company considers talent management to be a key element in its human resources strategy. Indeed, employees are the asset that will lead the transformational change that it is underway in the auto industry. In order to remain one of the leading companies in the sector, at Stellantis we strive to provide opportunities for our people to grow professionally, helping in the retention of skills and the development of talented and engaged teams.\n\nStellantis has set up governance for its Job Families and professions to protect its know-how and expertise and develop its talents across the Company supporting performance as a basis for equality of opportunity.\n\nIn addition, the Company collaborates with academic and scientific research institutions. Stellantis believes that these partnerships are crucial to contribute to the development of next generation skills and the empowerment of talented people who will lead the automotive industry in the next decades.\n3.2.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\n| CSR ISSUE | VISION / AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | 2021 RESULTS |\n|-----------|-------------------|----------------|------------|--------------|\n| CSR issue #5 | Attracting and developing all talents | Recruit and empower talents, by increasing a 'learning enterprise culture' and developing strategic skills, with the right talents in the key roles to create a highly committed workforce and seize new businesses. | Access rate to training (=No. of employees trained/total number of employees) | Short-term: 2024: 95% | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan): 2030: 100% | Long-term: 2040: 100% | 72% |\n| | | | | 2024: 10% | 2030: 30% | 2040: 50% | 5% |\n\n3.2.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nConsidering the transformation of the automotive industry that is currently under way, attracting and retaining talent within the Stellantis organization is of high importance.\n\n3.2.3.1 Risks\n\nThe automotive industry transformation requires the utmost attention and working to mitigate the following risks:\n\n- **Risk of underperformance:**\n  The transformation of the industry along with many other factors, has created talent challenges that must be accounted for and mitigated in order to avoid increasing the risk of underperformance.\n\n- **Risks linked with the tight labor market that is persistent in many markets around the world:**\n  In these markets, specific skill sets and the most talent people have many more options for employment so action is needed to make Stellantis stands out as an employer of choice. A mix of international career opportunity and competitive rewards combined with the excitement and passion that the Stellantis brands inspire in people supports the attraction and retention of talent.\nRisks related to a weak employer brand recognition:\n\nWe will strengthen communication about our employer brand to rapidly connect \u201cStellantis\u201d name with all Brands in the labor market. Specific marketing actions/campaigns with the brands will be launched and all existing brand career pages will be directed to the new Global Stellantis career page. Our New Global Employer Value Proposition - a summary of why people should join and stay with Stellantis - will be communicated in the Social networks through an highly recognizable editorial line to progressively educate the market on what makes Stellantis a work place of choice.\n\nUndesirable attrition could lead to reduced productivity or lost knowledge and skills if mitigating activities are not in place:\n\nDue to such important change required to strengthen the organization of Stellantis, some level of attrition is expected. The risk that it could lead to reduced productivity or lost knowledge and skills is monitored and actions are taken to mitigate this risk. Succession planning activities are in place for critical roles that support business continuity. The Job Family approach and the assessment of the identified strategic skills supports the identification if increased risk cause by a shortage of knowledge or skills. This information is used to identify specific development and retention activities that prevent the loss of these critical skills.\n\nRisk of not having the right skills in the right places at the right time:\n\nWith the opportunity to expand the skills of our workforce in the face of industry changes comes the need to evaluate the skills our current employees and develop plans to continue their employability with Stellantis. This reskilling requires significant effort and planning and if not done properly could present the risk of not having the right skills in the right places at the right time. Through the Job Family approach, strategic skills management and the various function academies, regular reviews and actions are taken to ensure the skills of the future are being cultivated.\n\n3.2.3.2 Opportunities\n\nMany opportunities exist that can be seized to further increase the attractiveness of Stellantis. Stellantis has already capitalized in many ways on these opportunities and will continue to do so. In 2021 34,571 new employees were hired which demonstrated how attractive Stellantis is as an employer (see also 3.1.8).\n\nA unique opportunity for talent to work with Stellantis, become exposed to, or work within a wide variety of cultures, thanks to a workforce composed of 170 nationalities\n\nThis opportunity for exposure to other cultures is an asset that is regularly used to help our employees learn, grow and develop. Through cross cultural teams, global projects, development programs, and specific international assignments, many employees at Stellantis can and do have an impact well beyond their geographical location. 23 Strategic Task Teams and Cross Functional teams have been created that focus on 23 core areas of importance at Stellantis that regularly provide updates to the Top Executive team. Not only are these teams paving the way for future success, but they are driving engagement and retention by providing the opportunity for talent to make an impact and continue to grow. Countless other project teams have formed, carried out their stated objectives and concluded as part of our integration, all of which providing employees with opportunities for cross cultural and cross functional development. Coupled with the New Era of Agility, remote working and the increasing capability of employees to collaborate from a distance, now, more than ever, are our employees able to seek to better understand the world around them.\n\nAn opportunity to evaluate all of the talent practices from the past and use lessons learned to define our future\n\nThanks to creation of Stellantis, many activities have begun and work teams have been formed to define the future practices and processes of the Company. The framework for all future Stellantis talent practices have been defined and are in the process of being launched. The experience and development of the employee is at the core of these practices and processes, with the focus on creating an engaging, inclusive and supportive culture. This environment will empower the career development of our employees while supporting the performance of the Company.\n\nAn opportunity to define leadership models\n\nBuilding on the strengths of our collective pasts while identifying and driving what will be necessary for future success, we defined Stellantis Leadership Models, adapted to local and regional specificities and rolled out to every employee that is used as foundation of everything that we do. These Leadership Models, based on our noble purpose and the core values of Stellantis, is at the heart of our company, setting expectations on how each employee is to behave and be held accountable.\nAn opportunity to re-evaluate and refine our workforce to define our future and ensure the ability to deliver future performance\n\nThe fundamental transformation of the industry, coupled with the creation of Stellantis also provides an opportunity to re-evaluate and refine our workforce to ensure the ability to deliver future performance. The establishment of a new Stellantis approach to Job Families and Professions, the mechanism used to define roles and the required skills to be successful in those roles, based on best practice from legacy activities, has provided the opportunity to rebuild the job content and skills requirements of the areas of the organization most impacted by technology. Through this refinement, the latest and future needs have been taken into account, which will further enable the effective development of the Stellantis workforce.\n\nLargest opportunities to accelerate change and drive performance\n\nThe increased diversity of Stellantis brings together viewpoints and experiences from different perspectives that are working together to challenge how things were done in the past. The transformation of the industry and the strategy of Stellantis is also leading to the integration of new technologies and business areas which is only increasing our diversity. The rapid growth and expansion of the electrification of the industry is creating a fundamental shift in large parts of the organization which will require new types of talent. Additionally, the increased focus on software and the creation of a software organization of 4,500 employees by 2024. Their mission is to develop new platforms and businesses that will propel future success.\n\nOpportunity to create talent challenges that must be accounted for and mitigated in order to avoid increasing the risk of underperformance\n\nNot only has there been a significant shift in the skills needed for success in many areas of the Company, but roles and the required skills for those roles is evolving. The ability to adapt to current skill needs and plan for the skill needs of the future is a significant challenge that is a point of focus within Stellantis. The Job Family team of Human Resource professionals and functional subject matter experts within Stellantis is tasked with the monitoring and evolution of the roles and skills needed within the organization. This team works directly with the Leadership Development team as well as functional learning academies to identify skills gaps through assessment that occur every year and carry out corrective action to close those gaps. This is done on both a reactive and proactive basis to support the continuity of operations.\n\nIMPACT MEASUREMENT OF THE ELECTRIFICATION STRATEGY\n\nThe transition to electric vehicles (EVs) impacts workforce skills: some employees need to update and adapt their skills to work on electrified powertrains, while electrification is also expected to create workforce needs in the Stellantis\u2019 already planned five gigafactories, twenty-one e-repair centers, and battery expertise center.\n\nOn those grounds, the electrification strategy is shared with the social partners and a regular follow-up is done in transparency, including as far as action plans to retrain employees are concerned. Stellantis is working to anticipate transformation demands for skills and to boost workers\u2019 employability through training courses.\n\nThis is part of a strategic orientation for investment aiming at supporting the industrial transition of existing facilities so that they are able to produce LEV components according to a vertical integration model (for more information, see section 2.5.3.2.2). To strengthen Stellantis\u2019 competitiveness, the business decision was taken to develop in-house assets and expertise.\n\n3.2.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nConvergence on the future Stellantis talent practices have begun in 2021 in key areas such as the establishment of the combined organizational structures and succession planning.\n\nThe entire Top Executive Team (TET) plays a vital role in building, reviewing and approving the top layers of the organization. The TET members worked, and continue to work, diligently with each other and their strategic Human Resources Business Partners on building, refining and improving the structure of their teams. Changes to the structure of their teams and talent placements are reviewed with the full TET, including the Chief Executive Officer, for discussion and approval in committee meetings that occur two times per month. For the layer under their direct reports, Top Executive Team members discuss, review and share their proposals with the Chief Human Resources Officer for input and approval. These reviews occur semi-monthly or monthly based on the volume of changes in a Strategy Council meeting or a dedicated HR committee meeting.\nThese activities, with direct executive involvement, led to the confirmation or creation of over 368 leadership teams, the appointment of over 2,152 leaders in Stellantis (with 24% of positions held by women, within the top three layers of the Company; +4 points versus the female representation in the former companies).\n\nSuccession planning activities to ensure that appropriate talent is available to fill critical or strategic managerial roles is also ongoing and will continue into the future.\n\nThe Stellantis Talent identification process aims to search for diverse profiles and experiences, identify talent more deeply within the organization, assign diverse talent to key positions, support new businesses, protect knowledge and know-how, promote and develop local skills, and objectify and reward performance.\n\nThe identified next career steps for employees is discussed by leaders in the organization and used to create formal succession plans. These plans are a particular point of focus for the analysis of the Stellantis talent pipeline as well as the identification and execution of development actions. Succession plans for critical and strategic roles are reviewed specifically with Top Executive Team members and are monitored by a team of HR professionals dedicated to the support of talent activities. These plans also form the foundation of developmental activities for this population of high potential employees with specific action identified to increase readiness and prepare talent for future roles.\n\n3.2.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nTalent management: unleashing the power of our talent\n\nBased on meritocracy and contributing directly to the corporate strategy, the talent management approach taken by Stellantis seeks to diversify profiles and experiences, identify talent more deeply within the organization.\n\nThe forward-looking vision for skills ensuring the best match between future needs and current resources. A network of expertise contributing to the Company\u2019s technological roadmap is in place, whose mission is to identify the skills required according to the technical needs within the Company. The response to the need for strategic skills is provided, either through internal mobility coupled with upskilling through training programs, or with the acquisition of external skills.\n\nWe defined five levers to develop the right talent with the right behaviors and to anticipate skills in order to seize new business opportunities:\n\n- **Talent to value approach:**\n  - identify our most value adding roles that drive performance now and in the future;\n  - detect our most talented people and put them in the right roles.\n\n- **Meritocracy as a golden rule:**\n  - recognize and reward top performing talents;\n  - raise the bar with every promotion or hire.\n\n- **Diversity as a driver:**\n  - promote diversity, inclusion, unity, teamwork and mutual respect;\n  - ensure equal opportunities.\n\n- **Strategic skills focus:**\n  - plan talent moves that will enable future success;\n  - develop and attract talents with strategic skills necessary to deliver on future needs.\n\n- **Speed and efficiency:**\n  - learn to compete based on scale and speed;\n  - think about organizations differently.\n\nStellantis talent development practices focuses on:\n\n- leveraging our diversity to make it a competitive advantage;\n- the ability to retain talent and attract new talent by strengthening the employee value proposition provided by Stellantis as well as an engaging and motivating work environment;\n- the complete overhaul of the management training to prepare managers for the new challenges of the Company;\n- strengthening the identification and development of talent through the implementation of a digital strategy and the utilization of data.\nFrom delivering training to establishing an organizational learning culture\n\nThe goal is to support the development of an agile learning organization:\n\n- rooted into both daily work practices and strategic business challenges;\n- leveraging social inclusion, diversity, collaboration and collective intelligence across countries and businesses;\n- putting the learners at the very core, with their motivations, aspirations and willingness to improve their employability.\n\nIt is much more than \u201cdelivering training courses\u201d. It means creating, researching and leveraging all the learning opportunities present in a global and diverse Company. It means helping to create common practicing behaviors aligned with personal and business challenges and learning the new technical skills needed to drive digital transformation and green and sustainable mobility.\n\nA comprehensive compensation policy that rewards performance\n\nStellantis\u2019 compensation policy is designed to promote and reward those who achieve results based on leadership and performance. The Company benchmarks its compensation and benefits programs for a consistent and fair approach, aligned with its overall business strategy, in the countries where it competes for talent. The Company communicates to all employees in every country, the various aspects of compensation, social benefits, health and disability insurance, personal development and working environment.\n\nAs evidence of the ability of the employee representatives to reconcile cost control, competitiveness and rewarding performance, 62 salary agreements were signed. The Company compensation policy has three main objectives:\n\n- to reward performance;\n- to provide a fair, competitive, market-driven compensation package;\n- to retain and attract key talent.\n\nOur compensation policies and practices are designed to follow Human Rights Guidelines and comply with applicable laws with a focus on diversity and inclusion. Compensation practices involving recruiting, promotions, annual salary reviews and incentive awards are reviewed for consistency across all employee groups. Allegations of issues regarding eligibility or compensation actions are reviewed for further analysis, explanation and eventual actions.\n\nIn France with non-discretionary and discretionary profit-sharing, and in Brazil with the Programa de Participa\u00e7\u00e3o nos Resultados. In other countries, the Company has implemented a Collective Local Performance Incentive (CLPI) plan. The CLPI, which is deployed based on the Company\u2019s economic performance, is distributed among the countries involved on a shared basis and is paid out according to terms defined by each country based on collective economic performance achievement criteria. The CLPI is progressively being implemented in countries with no profit-sharing program. To the economic performance criterion of operating margin, a criterion on quality results has been added. In addition to this fixed and variable compensation, there is an individual bonus plan.\n\nA base salary is determined on the scope of job responsibilities, experience and the competitive market. Collective variable compensation is a component of the comprehensive compensation programs offered by Stellantis to its employees. These collective programs target all categories of employee and aim to reward collective performance and engage employees in value creation for the Company.\n\nThe Company\u2019s determination to reward merit was demonstrated through the expansion of the bonus plans. In 2021, 60,541 Stellantis employees were eligible to receive bonuses. Stellantis offers Long-Term Incentive (LTI) for specific top managers and key talent, and 1,920 employees benefited. It is a significant component as it is designed to attract, retain and motivate expert leaders and talent. Performance goals set for LTI compensation is aligned with the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders \u2013 such goals include total shareholder return, synergies and CO\u2082 emissions reductions.\n\nLong Term Incentive by gender\n\n(Stellantis worldwide)\n\n| Year | Women | Men | Total |\n|------|-------|-----|-------|\n| 2021 | 366   | 1,554 | 1,920 |\n\nAs the Company continues in the integration of the merger, an analysis of all compensation programs globally was conducted to harmonize and benchmark competitive practices in each country.\n\nIn line with the Dutch Civil Code (DCC) and the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (DCGC), the CEO pay ratio and the trend is disclosed in the annual Remuneration Report as well as a description of the CEO compensation.\n3.2.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nTo remain competitive in an auto industry undergoing transformational change, employees are encouraged to envision a career that involves continuous learning. Stellantis offers several learning and development opportunities, including training, coaching, mentoring, job rotations. The Company invested about \u20ac141 million in training during 2021, delivering about 3.49 million hours of training to approximately 202,437 employees. Investments in virtual and on-the-job training focused primarily on the Company\u2019s four core training concepts:\n\nEmployees trained by geographic area and age\n(employees trained at least 1 time)\n\n| 2021          | Up to 30 yo | 31-50 yo | Over 50 yo | Total of employees trained by geographic area |\n|---------------|-------------|----------|------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Enlarged Europe | 13,706      | 61,843   | 38,537     | 114,086                                       |\n| North America  | 15,509      | 28,693   | 17,030     | 61,232                                        |\n| South America  | 3,855       | 12,692   | 1,616      | 18,163                                        |\n| Middle East & Africa | 1,804 | 3,080   | 164        | 5,048                                         |\n| China and India & Asia Pacific | 709 | 2,941   | 258        | 3,908                                         |\n| Total of employees trained by age | 35,583 | 109,249 | 57,605 | 202,437 |\n\n2021 KEY FIGURES\n\nTraining hours distribution per training area\n\n- Development of job-specific know-how: 50.17%\n- Managerial skills: 4.38%\n- Cross-cultural awareness and language skills: 21.70%\n- Corporate campaigns, rules and commitments: 7.56%\n\nSoftware Division\n\nA software division was created as stand alone division with the mission to develop new platforms and businesses that will propel future success. In order to staff the new Software Division, a recruitment effort is deployed in five main hubs (U.S., India, Italy, France and Germany) to provide software critical skills from the global Tech labor market. The hiring process, started in July 2021, allowed the on boarding of 300 newcomers at all levels in 2021 and planned to recruit up to 550 new employees within 2022 in this area. The objective Stellantis targets is to have 4,500 efficiency-driven software engineers in those hubs around the globe (1/3 from hiring and 2/3 from upskilling or reskilling).\n\nCOMPANY TRANSFORMATION THROUGH THE SOFTWARE STRATEGY\n\nThe Top Management Team decided to launch a Software and Data Academy starting in 2022 to reskill over 1,000 Stellantis employees in software professions and reconvert internal existing talents into skills critical for the Company in the future.\n\nAmazon and Stellantis collaboration for customer-centric connected experiences\n\nAmazon and Stellantis N.V., a leading global automaker and mobility provider, have announced on January 2022 a series of global and multi-year agreements that will transform the in-vehicle experience for millions of Stellantis customers and advance the mobility industry\u2019s transition to a sustainable, software-defined future.\n\nStellantis is accelerating its shift to becoming a sustainable mobility tech company. Stellantis and Amazon will collaborate to deploy Amazon\u2019s technology and software expertise across Stellantis\u2019 organization, including vehicle development, building connected in-vehicle experiences, and training the next generation of automotive software engineers.\nA new Learning organization to drive the learning culture transformation\n\nIn 2021 the new Global Learning Team has been established. Reporting to the Learning and Diversity and Inclusion Unit, it is aimed at steering the journey towards the growth of the agile learning organization.\n\nThe Global Learning Team and the Technical Training Teams (teams dedicated to provide Job Families specific training) have been designed to combine, on global basis, business performance with the fulfillment of each employee\u2019s development expectations. Strategies, approaches, methods and ecosystems related to the \u201cLearning culture transformation\u201d are addressed by the Global Learning Team. In addition, this team is focused on the common needs which are at the very heart of Stellantis citizenship: values and purpose, strategic drivers, cross-cultural awareness and diversity, leadership and development opportunities. On the other hand, Technical Training Teams are more focused on job-related skills which are needed to perform in the different roles: Engineering, Industrial, Sales and Marketing, Retail and Corporate. They are guided by Job Family objectives and business lines\u2019 priorities across countries. Finally, Learning teams at the region and country level support the implementation of global initiatives and manage local challenges, rules and specific needs.\n\nAn example of a Region-wide initiative, fully consistent with the mentioned learning strategy, is the Digital Transformation delivered in Extended Europe. It adopts design thinking and agile methodology principles. It is clearly related to a Regional business priority, the impact is measured in terms of gained synergies, it leverages internal coaching and mentoring and it is led by the very top.\n\nDevelop global and agile talents: redesign and deploy new management training programs\n\nA Global Leadership Development team was created in 2021 dedicated to the design, planning, education and governance of all talent management and leadership development activities. This includes a focus on Stellantis Leadership Models, performance management, leadership assessment, individual employee skills assessment, talent identification, career planning, succession planning, and development planning. The Global Leadership Development team is also responsible for identifying common global talent needs, designing tools and methods for addressing those needs in conjunction with the Global Learning team, and enabling the HR team around the world to use those tools. The tools include, but are not limited to, assessment centers, coaching, mentoring, and digital assessment tools. This team works closely with a global network of over 20 leadership development professionals specifically identified to coordinate and support talent activities within each regional organization and each global function. This global network works together to lead the execution of all talent activities with the operations facing HR teams around the world. Human Resources Business Partners also, as a core component of their roles, drive the execution of talent activities and focus on strengthening the talent pipeline within Stellantis.\n\nEmployee benefits\n\nThe overall Company\u2019s compensation policy also includes providing an employee competitive benefits program in each of the countries, while controlling costs and meeting the Stellantis\u2019 social responsibility commitments. As the Company continues in the integration of the merger, an analysis of all benefit programs globally will be conducted to harmonize and benchmark competitive practices in each country.\n\nStellantis sponsors supplementary employee benefit programs worldwide that are aligned with local practices. Typical benefits can include cafeteria/lunch vouchers, childcare services, fitness/gym services, wellness/nutrition programs, etc.\n\n3.2.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nMany specialized programs exist across the regions that are targeted at developing our junior or high potential talent. These range in format from project-based programs where participants are deployed into different project teams or to achieve specific objectives, to rotational development programs where participants spend periods of time embedded full time in an organization or team. Rotating from team to team the talents gain a breadth of experience that usually takes years to gain. These programs are offered for several key functions across the Company including, but not limited to, engineering, manufacturing, finance, purchasing and the commercial groups. To date, over 500 employees have participated in one of these projects based or rotational development programs.\n3.2.7.1 Initiatives to promote and develop our Workforce\n\nSafeguarding career paths\n\nThere are several strategies aimed at anticipating new skills and providing the best possible learning solutions. The job-skills alignment process is being deployed across the world in Stellantis. Led by professional families owners, it is based on a standard definitions of professions and skills profiles.\n\nEvery year the professional development interview/assessment gives the opportunity to identify skills to be developed. The Global technical Training Teams provide resources, learning classes and technical library for self-development.\n\nStrategic competencies needed to stay competitive and prepare the future of the business are reviewed and validated on ongoing basis.\n\nThe white-collar worker are expected to prepare, with their direct manager, their self-development plan related to main skills (both technical and behavioral) to develop. An extended training offer is also available. On top of that, several functions (e.g. Engineering, Purchasing and Supply Chain Management, Industrial, Information and Communication Technology) have competency-based models in place aimed at better identifying technical skills need for both white-collar and blue-collar workers.\n\nThe safeguarding of internal careers is accomplished with the global internal retraining program known as \u201cTop Competencies\u201d.\n\nThis program supports employees who are changing profession or Job Family in case of transformation or linked to technological developments, through training paths that last over 18-24 months.\n\nIn 2021, 1,035 employees took part in such retraining paths, with \u20ac614,000 spent for this retraining path. Around 54% of these employees joined professions with new and rare skills.\n\nNew Era of Agility\n\nThe New Era of Agility (NEA) program, is an innovative hybrid concept of working based on 70% of remote work and 30% on site presence. This program launched in 2020 with the ambition of worldwide deployment and the mobilization of stakeholders including HR, Real Estate, ICT, employees and leaders to evolve the ways of working, behaviors and the mindset within the Company. At the heart of this project is the search for greater individual and collective efficiency: benefits for the health and safety of employees, improvement of their work-life balance, motivation and well-being, greater use of the digital and collaborative tools, decrease of bureaucracy as well as better economic and environmental performance. It is also a factor of attractiveness and new flexibility in talent acquisition.\n\nThe real estate teams have designed and are implementing new on-site space layouts aimed at increasing the complementarity of remote and on-site work with collective and collaborative spaces to encourage interaction, cross-fertilization and the development of a sense of belonging within the Company.\n\nThe Learning Team supports the New Era of Agility program with dedicated training paths, managerial programs and best practices. Several programs to support remote and virtual working have been delivered, including, seminars, key-note speeches, digital contents and resources, virtual classes. The new challenge of Hybrid work has been supported with a learning environment designed \u201caround the learner\u201d to give employees the opportunity to leverage the resources needed in the right moment.\n\nIn 2021 the New Era of Agility project was deployed in 23 countries, allowing the employees in engineering and central support functions to work remotely up to 70% of their worktime.\n\nThe Stellantis Venture Lab intrapreneurial approach\n\nThe Incubator welcomes and guides Company employees who have innovative ideas or new business ideas. The methodology, which is used by startups, focuses on the following key items:\n\n- #PitchDays, where employees present their ideas;\n- #debugs, where employees who wish to help people who have ideas can come together in a brainstorming session;\n- #ProjectReviews, a review at the end of the incubation phases, before the Steering Committee.\n\nIf an idea is good, seems viable and interesting for the Company, it will be launched as a pilot experiment in the Business Factory. The Business Factory experiments with new businesses that have been identified as strategic for Stellantis. This mechanism\nenables full-scale testing of new businesses in order to assess their potential and benefit for Company customers. It gives employees a chance to dare by experimenting with new businesses that are often different from their area of expertise. In 2021, 1,375 proposals have been examined, more than 45 have been incubated and 6 have been transformed into experimentation.\n\nIncub\u2019s basics, a COOC (corporate online open course) has been created and is available for all Company employees. This online training allows Company employees to get used to lean startup methods and innovative ecosystems more quickly.\n\nStar*Up, launched globally in 2021, is a program aimed at encouraging and transforming our employee\u2019s ideas and promoting an intrapreneurship spirit within Stellantis. Employees were invited to submit their ideas and each region selected their top 5 ideas to enter a three-months incubation phase. The six regional finals, chaired by the Region\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO) selected the winning idea to represent their respective regions in the Global Finals. The winning idea was launched in the Business Factory.\n\nSupporting the Company\u2019s international expansion\n\nOur strategy finds a balance between the promotion of local talent and the need to build international career paths for our high potential talent. Reserving the expatriation process for high potentials allows the Company to improve the way we manage the costs of expatriation for the business and to encourage the development of local talent.\n\nAt the end of 2021, 230 men and women were working as expatriates in 35 countries in the world. Women represented 8.26% of Stellantis expatriates, a proportion that the Company wants to increase. The main countries of destination are, in descending order, China, Morocco, France, Germany and India.\n\nThe Global Learning Team has launched in 2021 a learning site on cross-culture awareness, self-assessment and development to facilitate international mobility and, at the same time, full visibility and involvement of local talent within the global arena.\n\nAnnual Appraisal\n\nThe Annual Appraisal is a fundamental strategy for assessing individual performance and development. For the 2021 year, the two performance management approaches from the legacy companies (Performance Appraisal for legacy PSA and Performance and Leadership Management for legacy FCA) were carried out for the respective predecessor company populations. While these two performance management processes were built over the years in different contexts, there were many similarities that stem from two cultures that are passionate about performance. In both processes, organization leaders define the collective objectives that each function will work toward achieving. These objectives were shared with managers and employees who work together to set individual objectives that support the collective targets of the company. Managers and employees are encouraged throughout the year to assess performance, identifying successes and focus areas to improve delivery.\n\nAt the end of the year a self-assessment and exchange with managers, managers identify a rating for the employee and document major achievements for the year. The assessment of objectives and performance for the year ties directly to a variable bonus payment for eligible employees. In the legacy FCA Performance and Leadership Management process, ratings were also provided based on a list of 10 specific leadership behaviors, as well as an overall leadership rating which impacted the overall rating and variable bonus payment. This rating information is used as an input in many HR processes including succession planning and internal talent mobility.\n\nIn 2021, the foundation was laid for a new unified Stellantis performance management process that takes the best of both approaches and increases focus on supporting employee performance through enhanced and continuous feedback and discussions. Continuous and transparent feedback is a core element of our commitment to develop and unleash the potential of employees.\nEmployer Brand\n\nWe recognize the importance of consistency within our Employer Brand (the Company reputation as an employer), and the need to demonstrate the same values and behaviors internally and externally. Our Employer Brand has a significant impact on Company reputation, from how customers perceive our Company to the ability to attract future talent. We publicly share our commitments and initiatives on Diversity and Inclusion. We are reviewing our Talent Acquisition policy and tools to ensure that our processes are bias-free and support equality of opportunity.\n\n3.2.7.2 Supporting Digital Transformation\n\nTo promote digital transformation within Stellantis, the Global Learning team delivers a digital barometer, called Digimapper, to evaluate the level of knowledge in the Company. Employees can afterwards access content to learn according to their results and opportunities for development. In addition, several workshops were designed to learn about digital methodologies, technologies and working methods.\n\nDigital Employee\n\nThe Digital Employee program aims to onboard all employees in the worldwide digital transformation and improve global well-being of each employee within the Company. The Digital Employee program is based on three pillars:\n\n- **Digital acculturation for all**: our ambition is to improve digital and data skills for all our employees in order to support our workforce in the digital transformation of their jobs and to help them to simplify their daily basis processes with new technologies, to be more focus on the added value tasks.\n\n- **New ways of working in line with the New Era of Agility program**: we are deploying new ways of working and greater use of digital collaborative tools to help our employees to be more agile and more efficient in their daily works. Our network of Labs supports the teams in using these agile and customer centric methods.\n\n- **Employee Journey simplification**: We have the goal to simplify all touch points in the employee journey and decrease bureaucracy by proposing useful digitalized services and paperless processes through our Stellantis employee portal.\n\nDigital learning\n\nTo enable employees to learn at their own pace and according to their needs, motivation and time, the Learning Team is continuing to expand its digital training catalog (8,500 resources are available in the form of e-learning, videos, tutorials, MOOCs, etc.) through two Learning Management Systems (LMS) known as \u201cLearn\u2019in\u201d and \u201cThe Learning Hub\u201d. Both systems are accessible on mobile devices to allow as many employees as possible access to learning resources. COVID-19 has accelerated the expansion to reach learners wherever they are in order to leverage their motivation and agility. 58% of hours were attended via digital learning in 2021.\n\n3.2.7.3 Learning\n\nEngaging the Universities\n\nThe Philanthropy team facilitated online webinars for university students, reaching more students from the Politecnico of Turin. In-depth discussions focused on Stellantis\u2019s sustainability performance and transparency requirements for companies to disclose how they operate and manage social and environmental challenges.\n\nThe Company has been involved in providing technical support for years to university teams that design and produce prototypes in European Formula SAE events. In 2021, Stellantis took part in the jury of the 16\u00b0 competition, at both the remote and physical events, respectively focused on business model and race competitions for electric vehicles.\n\nInternational Dual Master\u2019s Degree Program with Politecnico of Turin (Italy), the University of Windsor (Canada) and Oakland University (U.S.), and our partnership with McMaster University (Canada). The partnership with McMaster University focuses on developing next-generation, energy efficient, high performance, cost effective electrified powertrain components and control systems suitable for a range of vehicle applications. This collaboration has contributed to technical advancements and the expansion of employee competency and to new employees engaged in the field of hybrid and electric vehicle technologies.\nSpecifically, in the ADAS area, the Company provides its expertise to develop training courses in partnership with major engineering schools, in order to contribute to the development of this technical strategic field. Here are different types of delivery in 2021:\n\n- The ECE school asked the Company to help it develop an autonomous vehicle training program (AD and ADAS). It is now integrated into the curriculum of the school\u2019s students. The content has been adapted to be also used internally to improve the skills of internal employees.\n- The Company contributed to design the content of an ADAS program with the ESTACA school. This certification program aims to meet the needs of industrial companies by allowing employees to retrain in 3 years in the field of ADAS. The majority of learners in this first current promotion are Company\u2019s employees.\n- Another example with the partnership with the Mines Paris Tech major school: the Company expertise contributes by defining the needs of educational content. The school will develop short training modules focusing on ADAS topics as data fusion, which will be used by automotive companies.\n\nNew learning impact measures\n\nConsistently with the new mission, the Learning Team is benchmarking and designing a new set of KPIs aimed at providing a more comprehensive view of the impact of learning in all its different and interconnected facets: formal and informal, social, digital, agile, embedded in business and daily work processes, driven by the learner more than by the Company, etc. Traditional measures, designed to report the mere provision of formal courses, are in fact no longer adequate to value all this richness and variety. This new set of KPIs, after approval, will be fully deployed along 2022.\n\nNew management learning to support the Company\u2019s strategic issues\n\nThe Leadership Academy, part of Learning and Diversity team delivers programs that are specially designed for managers. The approach to all programs is to mobilize and equip all managers with the most effective mindset and behaviors to tackle the business and the transformation of the Company. The Leadership Academy brought a renewal of programs and the creation of two new programs: \u201cLEAD\u201d (for high potentials) and \u201cBeyond Horizons\u201d (for all Vice-Presidents and Senior Vice-Presidents). The \u201cLeadership In Action\u201d (LIA) program, which works on leadership concepts and is based on collective intelligence, was designed to help managers become motivating leaders for their teams who can keep up with cultural changes by adopting the new Company values and new behaviors.\n\nNorth America delivered a fully digital \u201cNew Leader training program\u201d targeted to newly appointed managers. Another example, also in North America, is a development program designed specifically for women was used in 2021 in order to further deliver on our commitment to increase female representation in our most senior leadership roles, with the program being used as a template for a program for ethnic minorities currently under development. In South America a training course was given to some 260 leaders and talents over a 3-month period. In Europe two innovative, project based leadership development programs were continued, one for junior talent and one to prepare leaders for more senior roles. China delivered virtual mentoring program for 99 talents. India continued to have virtual instructor led workshops in leadership area, specific mention is the team-building program \u2018Collab\u2019 covering 250 employees conducted virtually.\n\nGlobal Learning team\n\nAn example of initiative promoted by the Global Learning team is the \u201cCross-Cultural Awareness global site\u201d, a virtual square where people can self-assess their cultural styles, get feedback, tools and insights on different cultures, exchange views with colleagues based in other countries. Consistently with our learning strategy aimed at leveraging individual accountability for learning and development, it is more a combination of peer and social learning opportunities than a compulsory training program. Similar concepts have been applied to digital literacy and digital transformation (Digital WoW), diversity and inclusion, learning and sharing actual practices on the new Era of Agility and new way of working (hybrid, versatile, self-directed).\n\nTechnical Training Teams\n\nAn example of programs designed and delivered by Technical Training Teams is the Engineering one: The peculiar and innovative training activities took place on 3 fronts: Connectivity, Electrification and Vehicle Automation. All these activities were carried out with internal trainer specialists, mostly identified within the Product Development Technical Career Community.\nFor Connectivity courses were held on Architectures, Cybersecurity, Geolocalization, Big Data and Human Machine Interface.\n\n**Training on Electrification** was about Hybrid and Electric architectures to NVH (Noise, Vibration and Harshness) for Hybrid and Electric Vehicles and Battery Cells and Packs System.\n\nOn the **Vehicle Automation topic**, a suite of specific courses has been created covering the following contents: Autonomous Driving, Introduction to Agile Methodology, Sensors, Control System, CAN Network and Architecture trend.\n\n**Customer Experience Training** dedicated to Sales and Marketing and Retails employees to support the ambition of Stellantis to be the n.1 in the Customer Satisfaction. The aim is to build the awareness and commitment of each employee towards this goal. A deep dive on Net Promoter Score, Failure Rate and Warranty Accrual to show the direct impacts on Customer Satisfaction level and based on:\n\n- management of customer interactions in dealership reception situations or in spare parts hubs call centers;\n- warm up to reduce musculoskeletal disorder with an immersive program (Virtual reality);\n- professional risks decrease in spare parts hubs with an immersive program (Virtual reality);\n- better phone communication with the clients.\n\n### 3.2.7.4 Compensation and Benefit\n\n**Employee savings plan**\n\nEmployee savings plans allow employees from several countries to invest in Company shares or other diversified instruments (shares, bonds, monetary) with a varied yield/risk ratio depending on the instrument. At the end of December 2021, employee savings plans represented \u20ac27.16 million.\n\n**Health and Welfare Benefits**\n\nThe Company offers life insurance in all countries where Company insurance can be set up. For health care benefits, the Company provides health care insurance to employees that is competitive within country local practices.\n\n**Retirements/Pensions**\n\nPensions at the end of 2021, the commitments recorded in the Company\u2019s accounts under defined-benefits pension programs were \u20ac767,538,441 and were covered by dedicated funds of \u20ac28.8 million. These valuations are conducted annually, in accordance with the IAS 19 standard, by an international actuary firm, based on assumptions audited by the Company\u2019s Statutory Auditors. The Company has set up defined-contribution pension programs in all countries where necessary according to market practices and available resources. Some defined-contribution plans are in place in countries such as France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Canada and the United States, with country-specific modalities.\n\n---\n\n**IMPACT MEASUREMENT OF THE ELECTRIFICATION STRATEGY**\n\nIn 2021, the people trained on electrification-related topics within several professions have been 36,320, with 81,606 hours delivered.\n\nFor example, in the Engineering perimeter:\n\n- training on electrification have been covered one wide range of topics, from hybrid and electric architectures to NVH (Noise, Vibration and Harshness) for hybrid and electric vehicles and battery cells and Packs System;\n- 2,000 ex-PSA engineers specialized in the strategic domains identified to follow the evolution to new mobility and connectivity, have been involved into programs called \u00abTOP competencies\u00bb and \u00abskills2move\u00bb;\n- in e-Powertrain, specific training courses were developed and delivered with different levels until the advanced one for Electric Machine, Power Electronics, Electrical Energy Storage and Charging System. These specific training courses were prepared and delivered by internal Specialists within the \u201cExpertise\u201d community and also in partnership with Schools and Universities.\n\nIn the Manufacturing perimeter, into the vehicle electrical authorization program a specific training course has been developed thought a specific project named \u201cBattery Pack\u201d. The aim is to upskill around 120 operators on the battery. This training course leads to a qualification certification, officially recognized in by the Metallurgy branch.\n### 3.2.8 Detailed Key Performance Indicators\n\n**GRI 103-2**  \n**GRI 202-1**

Company, the need for inclusion and diversity is stronger than ever and the COVID-19 crisis has confirmed how they matter more than ever. This report shows that the business case remains robust and that the relationship between diversity on executive teams and the likelihood of financial outperformance has strengthened over time.\n\nBy virtue of its structure and global vocation, Stellantis considers diversity as a strength. Through diverse teams, who are representative of the markets and communities we operate in, we gain a better understanding of the needs and expectations of our customer base, and a deeper understanding of market dynamics. Through fostering inclusion, we drive employee engagement and create the conditions for all employees to reach their full potential, leading to greater performance and businesses sustainability. Our Diversity and Inclusion Leadership Commitment is founded on clear principles, which ensure that basic human rights and dignity remain paramount, regardless of the country or region in which we operate. These principles are reinforced through commitments outlined in collective agreements, established in collaboration with our social partners.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nPowered by our diversity we lead the way the world moves, this is our purpose. Diversity and inclusion are therefore intrinsic parts of our Company\u2019s commitment on equity of opportunity. We work to offer our employees an inclusive work environment, where everyone can feel respected and valued. Stellantis publicly calls for the prevention of discrimination and the promotion of equal opportunities. Our Company\u2019s commitments have been detailed in various Company agreements, such as the Diversity and Inclusion Leadership Commitment, which will be published at the beginning of 2022. Our commitment is underlined through our signing of the UN Global Compact as Stellantis on 31st May 2021.\n3.3.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\n| CSR ISSUE | VISION / AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | 2021 RESULTS |\n|-----------|-------------------|----------------|------------|--------------|\n| CSR issue #6 | Reinforce diversity, equal opportunities and inclusion as a strength for our teams and business by influencing the development of new ideas and solutions that will shape the future | Workforce gender balance: % women in leadership position (N1-N2-N3) | Short-term: >28% | 2025: >28% | 2030: >35% | 2040: >40% | 24% |\n\n3.3.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n3.3.3.1 Risks\n\nIf we take no action relating to Diversity and Inclusion (D&I), or if our actions do not align with our commitments, then we are subject to, amongst others, the following risks:\n\n- Inability to attract talent leading to lack of diverse representation, hindering innovation and our ability to meet our customer needs\n- By communicating openly and widely on our D&I strategy and commitments we place D&I at the heart of our Employer Brand (the company reputation as an employer) and present Stellantis as an employer of choice to future talent.\n\n- Potential of non-compliance with local regulations and cost of managing individual employee claims on the grounds of discrimination or harassment.\n- Our Code of Conduct states our commitment to compliance with all applicable local laws, with some commitments going beyond legislative requirements. In addition, we provide comprehensive employee training on D&I, for example, Unconscious Bias, Preventing Discrimination and Harassment.\n- Difficulties when trying to build a global multi-cultural organization.\n- Through a comprehensive Intercultural Learning and Awareness Program, we ensure that employees are equipped with the knowledge and skills to work with colleagues in a multicultural working environment.\n- Difficulties when trying to integrate new generations.\n- Through Mentoring and Reverse Mentoring programs we ensure knowledge, experience, and insights are shared between generations within the workplace.\nReduced levels of employee motivation, with a potential impact on productivity.\n\n- Our first Stellantis Global Employee Survey will take place in early 2022. This will allow us to understand employee perceptions and feedback on engagement, well-being, motivation, and inclusion, and adopt appropriate actions to address any areas of concern.\n\nNegative impact on Company reputation and image.\n\n- We openly share our commitments on Diversity and Inclusion through our Company D&I Leadership Commitment which we will publish beginning of 2022, and our Code of Conduct affirms our commitment to maintain a fair and inclusive workplace, free of discrimination or harassment. We will monitor our progress against our action plans and will produce an annual report (first release planned at the end of 2022) to share our achievements.\n\n3.3.3.2 Opportunities\n\nAs a global Company, building and retaining a diverse workforce and fostering an inclusive environment, where all employees feel valued and respected, presents us with many benefits, including:\n\n- as a business, we are more agile with the ability to develop and adapt to social and industry transformations;\n- the ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers through diverse and representative teams;\n- increased employee motivation and engagement by maintaining a fair and inclusive workplace;\n- optimizing efficiency, leading to greater performance and business sustainability, by leveraging all talent and diversity;\n- from an external stakeholder perspective, we can maintain, and even improve, the Company\u2019s image and reputation due to our progress and achievements against our commitments and action plans;\n- by developing a strong employer brand, which is closely aligned with our Diversity and Inclusion strategy, we have the ability to attract and retain top talent.\n\n3.3.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nGRI 103-2\n\nThe Global Diversity Council is chaired by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and composed of the Stellantis Top Executive Team, some of whom also have the responsibility of Chairs of the Regional Diversity Councils for their region. The Council has the responsibility for setting the Company\u2019s Diversity and Inclusion strategy in alignment with the overall business strategy and objectives. It provides governance and oversight on the delivery of the key Diversity and Inclusion actions and the effectiveness of the Diversity and Inclusion function.\n\nIn early 2021, a new dedicated Global Diversity and Inclusion office was established, with responsibility for defining and implementing the Company\u2019s Diversity and Inclusion strategy on a global level and coordinating the extension of the global strategy into our regions and countries of operation.\n\nWithin our regions, the Chief Operating Officer chairs the Regional Diversity Council. Each Regional Council is responsible for establishing the Regional Diversity and Inclusion strategy and associated action plans, whilst supporting the implementation of local Diversity and Inclusion action plans, ensuring that regional and local actions align with the global strategy.\n\nMoreover, collective bargaining agreements, established in collaboration with our Social Partners, state our commitments on Diversity and Inclusion, with a focus on the elimination of discrimination and the promotion of diversity.\n\nWe all recognize Diversity as a competitive advantage and we build our global strategy on three main principles:\n\n- respect for human values: human dignity and basic rights should remain paramount;\n- respect for local traditions and context: we respect the traditions and culture of the countries in which we operate;\n- finding common ground: we strive to find the common areas and use them as a starting point for moving our global strategy forward.\n\nOn a Global perspective, the Stellantis Diversity and Inclusion strategy focuses on the main dimensions related to Gender and Generation. This approach is applied at a Regional level and integrated with local specificities.\n3.3.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\nStellantis is a global organization and across all of our locations and business areas we embrace diversity and inclusion, where everyone is valued for their contribution to the Company, leading to stronger employee engagement, increased innovation, and greater business sustainability.\n\nIn line with Our Purpose, we believe that Diversity and Inclusion is essential to the performance and sustainability of our business.\n\nWe seek to promote a diverse and inclusive environment where we respect the different characteristics of our employees, including but not restricted to, gender, age, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual orientation and disability. We also promote an inclusive environment for disabled people. The strategy reinforces our commitment to providing equality and fairness to all in our employment based on merit, and our zero tolerance approach to all forms of unlawful and unfair discrimination.\n\nThe strategy shares our aspirations in the area of Diversity and Inclusion in relation to our customers, our employees, our future talent, our leadership, and the communities within which we are located, whilst setting out the key areas of our approach:\n\n- **Commitment**: building a diverse and inclusive workspace that aims for stronger employee engagement, leading to greater business sustainability.\n- **Learning and awareness**: ensuring all employees have equal access to training and development opportunities, and a specific learning and awareness program to raise awareness on key Diversity and Inclusion topics.\n- **Employee Voice**: the importance of employee voice and creating channels for them to be heard.\n- **Employer brand**: ensuring we reach a diverse audience with our employment opportunities and ensure that our selection processes are free of bias.\n\nCode of Conduct\n\nThe Stellantis Code of Conduct (CoC) sets out the principles and requirements that employees are expected to respect in relation to Diversity and Inclusion, when interacting with colleagues, customers, suppliers, visitors and other business partners (80,201 employees trained).\n\nThe CoC details the Company\u2019s commitment to maintaining a fair and inclusive workplace, free from favoritism, violence, sexual and non sexual harassment, or any kind of discrimination including based on age, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. The Company promotes equal employment opportunity and diversity, where everyone is valued for their contributions to the Company.\n\nCollective Bargaining Agreements\n\nStellantis voluntarily formalized its actions in favor of diversity in its social dialogue. On an international scale, the Collective bargaining Agreements on Social Responsibility are committed to exceeding local legal requirements in applying and promoting the fight against racism, sexism, xenophobia and homophobia and, more generally, against intolerance of differences and ensuring respect for privacy.\n\nWithin former Groupe PSA, an agreement on \u2018Motivation and Well-being at work, was established in 2020. It has been updated in 2021 (for PSA Automobiles and Stellantis NV France) and affirms the Stellantis commitment to ensure equal treatment using objective criteria, such as skills and performance, to combat prejudice and to prevent direct or indirect, conscious or unconscious discrimination, particularly with regard to the real or supposed origins of people.\n\nHuman Resources Policies\n\nTo ensure we continue to promote equality of opportunity, we are in the process of aligning our Human Resources policies and processes with the Diversity and Inclusion vision and strategy. This exercise includes policies applicable to key elements of the employee journey, such as Talent Acquisition, Talent Development, and Remuneration, however, we ensure that information relating to Diversity and Inclusion within Stellantis is included in all relevant policies and processes, for example, the Job Families approach and Expertise network (for more information, see section 3.1.4).\n3.3.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nStellantis recognizes the value of engaging with and involving employees in our Diversity and Inclusion journey and has supported the establishment of a wide range of Employee Resource Groups (ERG) across the organization. These resource groups undertake multicultural learning opportunities, mentoring and networking events, community outreach initiatives, charitable activities and contribute to the development and improvement of HR policies and processes across the Company. We believe that employees actively participating in ERG, contribute to developing a diverse and inclusive working environment.\n\nOn a global perimeter, the \u2018Women\u2019s Alliance\u2019 of former FCA and \u2018Women Engaged in PSA\u2019 acts as a think tank that contributes to business issues and cultural change, and encourages the members to be actors of tomorrow\u2019s Company, through key management or expertise positions. Collectively both groups at the end of 2021 have 2,815 members and 224 Ambassadors/Partners, who are men and women committed to supporting the network\u2019s actions. They are active in 25 countries, and thus contributes significantly to the Company\u2019s cultural transformation. The two groups are working to create the \u2018Women of Stellantis\u2019 group, that focuses on promoting gender equality within the workplace.\n\nIn North America the following Business Resource Groups (BRG) are also active: Asians Connected Together (ACT), the DIVERSE+abilities Network (DaN), First Nations, Latins in Connection (LinC), Middle Eastern Employees Together (MEET), the Prism LGBTQ+ Alliance, the Stellantis African Ancestry Network Diaspora (STAAND), the Stellantis Veterans Group, the Women\u2019s Alliance, Women in Manufacturing (WiM), and the Working Parents Network (WPN). The Women\u2019s Alliance BRG supports two affinity groups representing the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) at Stellantis and Connecting Women in Technology (CWIT) and recently supported colleagues in Canada and Mexico to launch the Canadian Women\u2019s Alliance and Women\u2019s Alliance Mexico BRGs. Similar groups are planned to be launched in the other regions in the near future.\n\nA proportion of the Company\u2019s Learning and Development budget is dedicated to learning interventions related to Diversity and Inclusion, with the objective of raising awareness and expectations with our workforce, including all-employee learning and a specific focus within our global leadership programs.\n\n3.3.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nStellantis is aligned with the vision of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on Gender Equality, and committed to following the UN Women\u2019s Empowerment Principles, which encourages companies to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women in the workplace, industry, and community.\n\nWith this commitment, the Company shares its intention to adopt business practices that support gender equality and empower women within the Stellantis organization, globally and across the automotive industry. These include, among others, processes to ensure equity and fairness in the determination of compensation levels (Blue Collars average wages for women is 94% of average wages for men and 91% for White Collars), annual salary reviews and promotions; provision of flexible working opportunities to support work-life balance arrangements; and events to foster interest in technical careers among women.\n\nIn 2021, in North America, Stellantis earned 90%, a top score on the annual Disability Equality Index (DEI), a comprehensive benchmarking tool that helps companies build focused and measurable strategies that support disability inclusion and equality in the workplace. Administered by Disability:IN and The American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD), the Index represents those businesses that have invested in accessibility and inclusion across their enterprises and are recognized as the best places to work for disability inclusion.\n\nStellantis supports public policies in favor of diversity\n\nFormer Groupe PSA was one of the first French companies to be awarded the Diversity label in recognition of the human resource policy and best practices in promoting diversity and equal opportunity and preventing discrimination. Since obtaining this label in 2009, former Groupe PSA maintained its commitment and the current label, valid for a period of three years, dates from November 8, 2019. In addition, former Groupe PSA was the first company to receive the \u201cGender Equality label\u201d in France in 2005. The current label, valid for a period of three years, dates from January 10, 2020. It marks the Company\u2019s long-term commitment and ongoing progress toward gender equality. These labels are awarded after a demanding certification process conducted by AFNOR Certification via an on-site audit. Similarly, in Spain, former Groupe PSA\nheld the Diversidad label, accredited by the Diversity Foundation with the support of the Spanish Ministry of Equality, since 2009.\n\nPrior to the merger, former FCA received a number of recognitions for our commitment to diversity in 2020. As an example, former FCA was ranked in the Refinitiv Diversity and Inclusion Index in the global \u201cTop 100 Most Diverse & Inclusive Companies\u201d. The index lists the most successful companies in promoting and leveraging diversity and inclusion in the workplace. In addition, for the 17th year former FCA was included in Latina Style\u2019s 2020 list of Top 50 U.S. companies for Latinas.\n\nGender Equality\n\nStellantis adopts a proactive commitment to promoting gender diversity and professional equality between men and women. In view of its traditionally male sector of activity, the Company considers the gender balance of its core businesses and key positions as a fundamental objective of its responsible and sustainable development and of its employees\u2019 quality of life at work. In 2021 women represented 24% of top management (N1-N2-N3) and 32% of hiring with all employee categories combined.\n\nStellantis defines the following target and commitment:\n\n**Gender diversity of top management:** >35% by 2030, eliminating under-representation of women in top management;\n\nThe cross-functional management of Company Job Families and Professions (see section 3.1.7) incorporates objectives of gender balance of key positions. Each job family has appointed a female ambassador who promotes gender diversity and creates action plans adapted to her business line.\n\nIntergenerational diversity\n\nStellantis seeks to strengthen the place of more experienced employees and considers them an advantage for the Company\u2019s success. Through reverse mentoring programs, the Company encourages knowledge transfer, and considers this exchange and the coexistence of generations as an asset for social cohesion and business performance.\n\nIn addition, the Company has programs in place to attract the next generation of talent into the automotive industry. In 2021, the Company welcomed 4,462 work-study program participants (skills-acquisition and apprenticeship contracts) and 4,013 interns.\n\nOn a regional basis, countries such as India and China have specific projects focused on attracting candidates directly from University campuses in order to meet our future skills requirements in areas such as software and digital technologies.\n\nCultural Diversity\n\nIn the United States, Stellantis has developed several programs and policies specifically supporting ethnically underrepresented populations. In 2021, two leadership development programs, focused on Black and Multicultural talent, were launched to prepare emerging diverse talent for leadership opportunities. Candidate hiring slate requirements were established to ensure diversity among candidates interviewing for internal and external opportunities. Additionally, diversity targets were established and tracked for senior leadership, as well as top management. Diversity Action Plans by function have been established to identify specific actions to be taken to close talent gaps. In 2021, Stellantis launched the Black Supplier Development Program, in collaboration with the National Business League (NBL), to develop Black suppliers for future contracting and procurement opportunities in the pursuit of greater racial equity in the marketplace. The Stellantis-NBL National Black Supplier Development Program will support the development of Black businesses around the country and internationally for future opportunities within the federal government and public and private sectors.\n\nMaternity, paternity and educational parental leave\n\nStellantis takes parenthood into account as part of its respect for gender equality in the workplace. By supporting a work environment encouraging employees to return to work after maternity leave, Stellantis policy helps employees who are parents to achieve a better work-life balance. It also ensures employees are informed about the various possible parental leave options, depending on the legislation, encouraging both mothers and fathers to take advantage of it.\nOn top of the public regulation, Stellantis has a proactive approach with its social partners, for example in order to support working parents. A company agreement was signed in 2014 in France with all trade unions to establish an innovative social cohesion system based on the values of solidarity and mutual assistance. Under this agreement, employees can donate days off to parents with a sick child, anonymously and without receiving anything in return. The donated days are banked in a Solidarity Fund created for this purpose and is managed by the workplace social services. In 2016 a new agreement extended the program to spouses, common-law spouses and partners.\n\nStarting in 2020, another agreement extends this program to employees who are caregivers of a dependent or disabled relative. This program has received a strong response.\n\nIn 2021, 408.6 days have been donated. 237.5 days were granted to 20 employees to help them cope with a variety of situations including illness, disability or accidents.\n\n### Parental Leave by gender\n\n|                | Men  | Women | Total |\n|----------------|------|-------|-------|\n| Parental leave entitled | 16,202 | 5,883 | 22,085 |\n| Parental leave used      | 3,967  | 2,877 | 6,844  |\n| Back to work after parental leave | 3,093  | 1,326 | 4,419  |\n\n### Supporting individuals with disabilities\n\nStellantis policy regarding social and occupational inclusion of people with disabilities is enacted worldwide through various collective agreements with the goal of keeping workers with disabilities employed, carrying out preventive actions and promoting their integration into the workplace. Taking such an approach benefits everyone as well as the Company\u2019s performance and includes:\n\n- offering employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities;\n- changing how we look at disability by raising awareness among employees throughout the year and by reinforcing the training of managers and trainers;\n- taking action to include and retain employees with disabilities and maintain them in their jobs by supporting them and providing adjusted work solutions or specially adapted workstations;\n- mobilising all actors by improving awareness of collective agreements and of measures in favor of the workers concerned (local disability correspondent, social service, medical service, human resources function, management, employee representatives and employees) and by setting up preventive measures.\n\nOn a global level subcontracting with sheltered workshops is one aspect of the Company\u2019s commitment for the social and occupational inclusion of disabled people. Other initiatives dedicated to people with disabilities are in place at regional level. For example, in South America specific training and mentoring programs are in place, as well as dedicated listening groups for people with disabilities and the translation in sign language during main events. In North America the The DIVERSE\u2022abilities Network is one of the company\u2019s Business Resource Groups (employee-led groups that promote a diverse and inclusive workplace) that aims to support employees with disabilities and employees who are caregivers of family members with disabilities, by providing resources, training and development programs. Furthermore, the DriveAbility program in North America and Autonomy Program in Europe and Brazil are two examples of programs designed for customers with special mobility needs (see section 4.1.7 for further details).\nLearning and Awareness\n\nWithin the former FCA and PSA organizations, ongoing education programs have been in place and ongoing as Stellantis. We seek to engage and involve our employees in our Diversity and Inclusion actions and to nurture a diverse workforce. For example, recent training on the \u2018Prevention of Sexual Harassment at work (PoSH)\u2019 was mandated across the FCA organization. Within PSA organization, a new training program was deployed globally to address the issue of stereotypes and discriminatory behavior, which was a commitment of the \u201cMotivation and Well-being at work\u201d agreement with social partners. Using augmented reality technology, the key themes of sexism, working parents, age and invisible disabilities were addressed.\n\nIn line with the Global strategy, a program of learning and awareness is underway, with e-learning on key Diversity and Inclusion topics available to all employees, with a specific provision via Linked In Learning for our Management population. Other learning activities are also underway, including Conferences with external speakers and Leadership Roundtables. Work is ongoing on the creation of a bespoke Stellantis Diversity and Inclusion education and awareness program, to be made available to all employees globally, including specific content for the onboarding of new hires.\n\nIntercultural Program\n\nAs a truly global organization, it is important that we can provide employees with opportunities to develop their knowledge and skills on working in a multicultural environment. We have created an internal information hub dedicated to Intercultural Awareness, with access to a range of information and resources. Employees have also attended Masterclass to learn more about the cultures of specific countries within the Stellantis scope.\n\nEmployees have ongoing access to the \u2018Country Navigator\u2019 tool, which provides employees with the knowledge, skills and confidence to effectively communicate and collaborate with global colleagues, enabling a truly borderless workplace.\n\nMentoring and Development programs\n\nAcross the Company, we offer Mentoring and Reverse Mentoring programs to support employees\u2019 personal and professional development.\n\nWithin South America, in 2020, a specific program was run in Brazil with the aim of supporting women in preparing for a leadership position. Following positive feedback, in 2021 the program has been extended three other employee groups: employees from diverse ethnic groups, members of the LGBTQIA+ community, and employees with a disability.\n\nIn North America, Stellantis offers several development programs to prepare emerging diverse talent for leadership opportunities. For example, the award-winning Women\u2019s Leadership Experience, launched in 2018, will continue with enhanced content. Two additional programs, focused on Black and Multicultural talent, launched pilot programs at the end of 2021. Furthermore, Business Resource Groups worked closely with HR teams to create and roll out specific mentoring programs designed to bring together employees based on common heritages and ancestries. These programs continued in 2021. Business resource groups manage these dedicated mentoring programs, for example the Asians Connected Together, Latins in Connection and Middle Eastern Employees Together Groups, pairing leaders and employees who can share experiences and support developmental activities through the lens of shared cultural backgrounds.\n\nInclusive Leadership self-assessment\n\nDuring the 3rd quarter of 2021, North America region launched a self-assessment for all leaders. This self-assessment provided leaders with baseline measurements of inclusive behaviors, to include receptiveness (how curious and accepting is the leader), reflection (how self-aware and transparent is the leader) and revitalization (how Inspirational and Empowering is the leader). Aggregate data results with high-level insights on strengths, opportunities, and recommendations on improvements were communicated to Leadership. Based on the aggregate results, a learning and development plan will follow in 2022.\nEmployee Voice\n\nEmployee Resource Groups\n\nAcross the Stellantis organization, local operations have established Employee Resource Groups who contribute to the local efforts on Diversity and Inclusion. As we continue to share best practice across the organization we aim to expand certain networks as a priority (see section 3.3.6).\n\nIn the UK, RUOK? (Are You Ok?) is an employee-led group, created to support the mental health and well-being of employees through raising awareness, providing information and resources, and removing the stigma associated with mental health by providing the space and time, and encouraging conversation around mental well-being.\n\nCourageous Conversations\n\nIn North America, employees are invited to participate in \u201cCourageous Conversations\u201d \u2013 open and sometimes challenging discussions surrounding social issues. The sessions are led and facilitated by Company leaders who guide participants in open dialogue. The goal of these sessions is to help one another be more open to listen, learn and contribute to an inclusive workplace where respect for ethnicity, gender, and cultural differences can flourish. Through the end of 2021, more than 130 volunteer facilitators were trained and 2,000+ employees participated in these important conversations, which will continue in 2022. In the 4th quarter of 2021, a new initiative called Conscious Choices was launched, expanding on the concept of Courageous Conversations by bringing together employees in a small cohort to participate in a facilitated session over a six-week period to discuss topics such as unconscious bias, microaggressions (commonplace daily verbal, behavioral or environmental slights, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative attitudes toward stigmatized or culturally marginalized groups.), equity and inclusive language.\n\nEmployee Survey\n\nIn order to assess the impact of our Diversity and Inclusion strategy and action plans, a global employee survey will be launched at the beginning of 2022, which will gather employee feedback in relation to Diversity and Inclusion within Stellantis in addition to assessing employee motivation and well-being.\n\nWhistleblower Line\n\nThe Company is committed to maintaining a working environment free of bullying, sexual and non sexual harassment, victimization and discrimination. Employees are regularly informed of this policy and those who have experienced or witnessed acts of workplace harassment, discrimination or bullying are encouraged to report this through a number of reporting channels, including their direct supervisor/Line Manager, the Human Resources function, the Compliance or Legal Departments, and a dedicated Whistleblower Line (for more information, see section 3.1.7). Cases are investigated via the Company\u2019s disciplinary and grievance procedure.\n\nIn 2021, a total of 1,077 cases via the helpline and via other channels 891 cases of workplace harassment, discrimination or violence were processed.\n3.3.8 DETAILED KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n3.3.8.1 Top executive by age and gender\n\n| 2021 | Up to 30 years | 31 to 50 years | Over 50 years | Total

We attend to employee safety and well-being by applying a methodical approach that involves stakeholders, employees, employee representatives, the medical community and management.\n\nThere are mandatory training and certification requirements targeted to operations and facilities. We provide health and safety protocols and recommendations regardless of where the workplace is located, on-site, home or remote working locations.\n\nWe innovate by challenging the status quo, such as remote working encouraged where applicable to reduce CO\u2082 emissions associated with employee commutes and to expand well-being in the workplace, improve efficiency and quality of life by encouraging work-life balance.\n\nThe current COVID-19 crisis highlighted the commitment, the robustness, and the ability of the Health and Safety community to provide the relevant recommendations, based on the best knowledge available, to the leaders and managers to address an unprecedented threat. This commitment, robustness and ability are in place to relentlessly address each issue related to health, safety and well-being with the same methodology, striving to offer safe and best in class working conditions to everyone, everywhere, every day.\n\nOne of the goals to promote health and safety is to prevent illness clusters from the COVID pandemic, including the exposure during the commute by public transportation. Evolving high level sanitary protocols based on World Health Organization recommendations supported by occupational physicians were implemented since the COVID-19 crisis began. Likewise, communication and management have been adapted to limit exposure to COVID and to address the decrease in morale of employees because of lockdown periods.\n\nThe merger of PSA and FCA required the harmonization of the Health and Safety systems of each company to create one seamless system. Alignment of the health and safety policy and processes, and adjusting safety standards ensured best practices of each company were realized. The Global Care Management System is the outcome of bringing together the best of both companies\u2019 practices.\n\nIn a nutshell our Well-being, Health and Safety policy embodies our Corporate Values by supporting the \u201cworking together\u201d (\u201cWe Win Together\u201d Value) and the sustainable performance of our Company (\u201cWe care for the future\u201d Value).\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nThe Company allocates resources (e.g. standards, safe equipment and workstations, people, employee assistance programs) for an overall health approach that goes beyond health at work and contributes to healthy choices and lifestyle. It supports the \u201cHealthy Workplaces\u201d initiative promoted by the European Union and the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as similar initiatives in the U.S. Stellantis\u2019s commitment is demonstrated in the Well-being, Health and Safety policy, as well as in several collective bargaining agreements.\n3.4.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\n| CSR ISSUE | VISION / AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | 2021 RESULTS |\n|-----------|-------------------|----------------|------------|--------------|\n| CSR issue #7 | well-being, health and safety in the workplace | Create a safe and engaging work environment promoting employees\u2019 health and well-being at work for a greater work life balance | Lost-time injury frequency rate [LTIR /1,000,000 hwkd)] | Short-term: <1 | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan): <1 | Long-term: <1 | 1 |\n\n3.4.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n3.4.3.1 Risks\n\nThe safety obligation is no longer understood only as an obligation for the employer to ensure the physical safety of employees (work accidents and occupational diseases). It has widened and now includes the protection of all the risks to which an employee could be exposed as a result of his/her mission, including protection from psychosocial risks.\n\nFor a company, Health and Safety performance at work has a direct impact on employee absenteeism and thus on the ability to operate and on labor costs through lower productivity (loss of working time, cost of occupational illnesses...). It can also affect the Company\u2019s reputation, impact staff morale or increase operating costs through fines and other contingent liabilities.\n\nWith the COVID-19 crisis that touched every part of the world with significant consequences in communities, but also on the business, requiring the adoption of new protocols and ways to work. Business impacts of increasing health costs, absenteeism and mental illness made it necessary to be innovative and agile to mitigate these risks.\nThe Company\u2019s actions and innovations to mitigate these risks\n\nStellantis is committed to prevent health and safety risks at work of employees by preventing fatality, disability, injury and illness; by completing risk analysis to identify workplace hazards and potential exposures, implementing containment and countermeasures to permanently reduce the identified risks; by promoting health and safety to support and enhance a healthy and engaged workforce; by empowering everyone, so that each contributes to improving the workplace and by deploying an effective management system to provide strong standards, measure our results and impacts and support our continuous improvement (see 3.4.6 and 3.4.7 for more details.)\n\nLost Time Injury Rate by geographic area\n(per 1,000,000 hours worked)\n\n| 2021 | Enlarged Europe | North America | South America | Middle East & Africa | China and India & Asia Pacific | Total |\n|------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------|\n| Total| 1.5             | 0.6           | 0.9           | 0.5                  | 0.2                           | 1     |\n\nFatality accidents\n\n| 2021 | Number | Rate |\n|------|--------|------|\n| Total workforce | 1 | 0.0021 |\n\nIn addition, the Company innovated to mitigate the increased risks for health and safety of its employees due to COVID-19 crisis.\n\nTaking into account the critical nature of the risks posed to the Company, the first and immediate actions were for the prevention of transmission of the COVID-19 among our employees and their loved ones. We defined global Stellantis governance with our physicians and health leaders from all regions to build common health protocols and unique protection measures. Weekly COVID-19 Committees bring together Stellantis physicians and Corporate and regional health leaders to monitor the situation and take common decisions. At the operations level, daily crisis cell meetings addressed concerns and issues. Concerns were processed by specific and multidisciplinary working groups that were referred to the COVID-19 committee, allowing reactivity, global vision and efficacy in the decision process.\n\nThe Stellantis team followed the evolution of the pandemic to adapt our actions. We used weekly Global and local reports about cases among our employees and the level of absenteeism to assess the impact of our actions and adjust them if necessary. Our Stellantis protection measures were often stricter than the ones defined by the local authorities; we claim this difference as a demonstration of the care we bring to each employee.\n\nAcceptance of the COVID-19 protocols by our employees has been a key lever of the prevention measures effectiveness. Easing of measures was done, when possible, by examining local situations and changing the central guidance. Changes to measures were explained through discussions with managers, unions, health and safety professionals, and other stakeholders.\n\nVaccination against the COVID-19 is one pillar of our policy to protect employees and allow the business to run. Stellantis supported local vaccination policy and enabled employees to be vaccinated, through government vaccination programs, or, when possible, through internal vaccination centers (France, Germany, Italy, India, Brazil, and U.S.).\n\nAt the Mirafiori facility in Turin, Italy, an internal COVID-19 Vaccination HUB opened in mid-June. The vaccination campaign offered COVID-19 vaccines to employees who requested to be vaccinated. This campaign successfully vaccinated approximately 1,000 employees, the vast majority with the required 2 doses for the chosen vaccine. The vaccination hub was built within the Mirafiori facility, following the directions of competent authorities with the resources of the Well-being Health and Safety (WHS) Central Staff, nurses, and a group of competent doctors. The vaccination activities proceeded at a fast pace following the planning shared with the competent regional authority resulting in positive feedbacks from the employees who used it.\nStellantis provided our employees with a dedicated app to ensure their self-monitoring protocol was completed daily, where it was possible to register for vaccinations and tele-monitor suspected and confirmed cases.\n\nStellantis common requirements, designed by an international teamwork, are the common rules to be applied everywhere, even if the local regulation is less strict.\n\nWe provide the regional Chief Operations Officers and the Chief Human Resources and Transformation Officer weekly reports about the pandemic worldwide and the health situation of Stellantis employees, including number of active cases.\n\nBeing successful in protecting our people and promoting health and well-being is a question of policy and commitment but also of structured and efficient actions. A global management system, whose principles and tools are also integrated in the Stellantis Production Way system (for more information, see section 3.4.7), is built to define common processes and requirements, follow the implementation, supported by training and learn from our failures. (for more information, see sections 3.4.5 and 3.4.7)\n\nAt the heart of the crisis, at the beginning of 2021, Stellantis Health services implemented a survey on mental health, stress, well-being and motivation in 19 countries in Europe. Results have been shared in every country and action plans are implemented under the responsibility of the country management. The survey showed that:\n\n- the main determinants impacting Stress are: Time constraints / over-investment at work / interruptions of activity;\n- the main determinants impacting Motivation are: Career evolution / Concern for Well-being / Equity;\n- short work impacts motivation highly and with less intensity Stress.\n\nAddressing the main concerns of the workforce allows to strengthen health, well-being and motivation.\n\nIn recognition of structural changes in the economy brought about by the COVID-19 crisis, we recognize that employees who were forced to work at home reported that the lines between work life and home life can blur. The New Era of Agility (NEA) (see section 3.2) also provides guidelines to be respected that put a framework in place to define the differences between work and personal time. NEA is a great opportunity to promote work-life balance and flexibility across the various regions. This transformation project has visibility outside the Company and this program strengthens our reputation and attractiveness to potential employees.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic and the shift to remote work for many employees, necessary actions were deployed to maintain social networks, advise our employees on physical and mental health issues and to identify and support any individual difficulty.\n\n3.4.3.2 Opportunities\n\nThe Stellantis Well-being, Health and Safety policy is based on the conviction that our actions have a significant impact on many critical domains. It is a fundamental aspect of our social responsibility towards our employees and all the people working in our facilities as well as the mark of the Company\u2019s respect for each of the individuals who are part of it:\n\n- bringing to life the Well-being, Health and Safety policy can improve the social climate and embodies our corporate values and its impact on our people\u2019s feeling of belonging;\n- taking care of our people and acting to reduce injuries has direct and positive consequences on absenteeism, which is important for all our operations;\n- acting to promote well-being and motivation through global and local actions is also a strong lever to improve productivity, quality, innovation, and the capability of our workforce to adapt positively to current and future challenges we will have to face and changes we will have to create.\n\nThe Well-being, Health and Safety commitments and actions strengthen our reputation internally and externally and help to attract and retain key talents and skills. Our actions on those domains also protect the Company and its top managers from compliance issues and potential litigation or penalties.\n3.4.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nThe governance process is overseen by the Strategy Council. In monthly Business Reviews the results related to Health and Safety are presented and discussed with the analysis of the impact on operations.\n\nThe Corporate Well-being Health and Safety (WHS) organization ensures proper coordination of WHS activities, processes and targets throughout the regional Stellantis Organizations. In each region a Well-being, Health and Safety leader is appointed and is in charge of contributing to the global policy, implementing the actions, supporting the operations in the region and providing the regional top management with results and analysis. Because the Health and Safety domain is part of the Stellantis Production Way management system (for more information, see section 3.4.7), key indicators of the manufacturing operations include the Health and Safety related indicators, among which Total Recordable Injury Rate, Lost Time Injury Rate and absenteeism rate. The proactive approach to Health and Safety will be tracked via the \u201cCare Index\u201d measuring the level of maturity of Health and Safety System Implementation in our sites.\n\nDialogue concerning improvement of employee health and safety with employee-representative bodies, in accordance with current laws and the collective bargaining agreements, has continued.\n\nDuring the year, due to COVID-19, there were dedicated discussions with employee representatives regarding the application of preventive measures by following specific guidelines in the workplace. These continuing meetings have led to adjustments to COVID-19 protocols in order to update them based on the latest information from recognized health authorities.\n\nIn North America (U.S. and Canada) weekly meeting to review changes in employee safety activities, procedural updates, and other opportunities for improvement is undertaken by the Joint Health and Safety Committee comprised of representative of Management and Labor Union.\n\nIn most host countries, joint management-worker organizations are in charge of monitoring the application of employee health and safety practices. 95% of Company employees are represented by 306 joint management-worker health and safety committees.\n\n3.4.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nThe Well-being, Health and Safety policy is defined as part of the Human Resources ambitions for Stellantis. Acting in a proactive mode and building our Well-being, Health and Safety program will be a competitive advantage for the Company.\n\nWe aspire to achieve World class levels of Health and Safety for everyone, everywhere, every time.\n\nWe act to:\n- prevent fatality, disability, injury and illness;\n- promote health and safety to support and enhance an healthy and engaged workforce;\n- empower everyone so that each contributes to improvement of the workplace;\n- deploy an efficient management system to provide strong standards, measure our results and impacts and support our continuous improvement.\n\nIn order to live up to our Health and Safety policy Stellantis created a well-being and motivation program, labeled \u201cWe All Care\u201d, based on 5 pillars that highlight the priority levers on which to act. This program was built based on a deep analysis of best practices and studies and identification of our organizational strengths:\n\n- **physical**: actions focused on safety, physical health promotion, health support, and sport promotion. It also includes our ergonomics commitments to prevent occupational illness such as musculoskeletal problems in the workplace;\n- **social**: creation of positive and supportive relationships at work through belonging, events, and a Stellantis Volunteer Program to encourage and enable our employees to address community needs and foster employee engagement in the community in which they live. Through our New Era of Agility Project (see 3.2.7) that redefines the balance between remote work and work in the office. Work spaces are recreated so time spent together has the highest social and collaborative impact. Finally, this pillar embodies our actions to promote our diversity and support multicultural education;\n- **professional**: provide training, and in some cases retraining, to support our employees in acquiring skills critical to building the future of the Company, while also building sustainable and attractive career plans;\nemotional: focus on actions related to success and belonging, promotion of work life balance and flexibility of working time, especially through our New Era of Agility program. Improve understanding of mental health issues and the prevention of the psychosocial risks;\n\nfinancial: actions related to reward, recognition, compensation and benefits policy, and the communication methods to explain it.\n\nThe five We All Care pillars also serve as the foundation of our Well-being Health and Safety (WHS) management system known as the Global Care Management System (GCMS). This integrated management system ensures that well-being, health, and safety is considered, planned for and implemented every day.\n\nIt is inclusive of Stellantis operations and includes specific requirements for manufacturing sites, which are contained in the fundamentals of the Stellantis Production Way (SPW) health and safety domain (see 3.4.7). Management at all levels of the Company works to ensure compliance with the principles stated in the health and safety policy, with a mindset of continual improvement.\n\nTo create awareness, promote well-being, health and safety and engage our employees, Stellantis initiated the WE ALL CARE days. This event launched at the end of October 2021. There was a set of actions organized at the Corporate and Regional levels involving plants and sites all over the world, to highlight the Company commitment on Well-being, Health and Safety (WHS). We communicated the new WHS Policy and addressed topics such as COVID-19, Safety at Work, Occupational Risks, Musculoskeletal Diseases, Mental Health, Well-being at work and remote work. There were several webinars and onsite actions. For example safety talks were conducted in North America that impacted approximately 62,500 employees and onsite actions including COVID-19 Audit/PPEs Actions and other topics had approximately 4,373 participants in South America.\n\nThe corporate WHS policy states: \"...we aim for the highest possible levels of health and safety for every-one, every-where and every-time. Our objective is to avoid any work-related injury, death, disability, accident or illness for every individual working for our company: employees, temporary employees and contractors.\" Majority holding joint ventures are included in our safety performance tracking and adopt common policies and processes. Visitors receive information on arrival to a site regarding the health and safety rules they must follow; close working relationships, with safety performance tracking, are established with temporary employment agencies in order to ensure temporary employees receive appropriate training before arriving on site. This is supplemented with on site training. Contractual obligations for minimum safety standards are established with contractor companies that can only work on site after risk assessments and method statements have been completed to ensure their interaction with our operations will not create additional hazards. Audits on contractor activities are routine practice.\n\nWith the Global Care Management System, Stellantis is compliant with the occupational health and safety recommendations of the International Labor organization (ILO-OSH 2001) and performs its obligations in all countries. Encompassing ISO 45001 requirements, the GCMS is a means to assess, monitor, and manage risks systematically.\n\n42 European plants have an Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems certified according to ISO 45001:2018 standard. Due to the replacement of OHSAS 18001 with the ISO 45001:2018 standard, the migration activities was concluded in September 2021.\n\nThe South America region has 10 plants of which 8 ones operating in 2021 are certified to the ISO 45001 standard.\n\nThe North America region operates under ISO 45001 certification for all manufacturing locations. The enterprise certificate is issued by third party auditors and covers Health and Safety, as well as Environment (ISO 14001) and Energy (ISO 50001). Joint Health and Safety Committees are in place at our represented facilities.\n\nWorker representatives are involved in Stellantis health and safety processes. Areas where worker representatives participate in health and safety processes include, but are not limited to, incident reviews, job risk analysis, safety observation tours and periodic health and safety reviews. Where there are formal joint management-worker health and safety committees, there are no bargaining unit workers that are not represented by these committees.\n\nExample: In the United States, the Local Joint Health and Safety Committee meets on a weekly basis. This committee reviews any incidents that may have occurred along with the root cause and countermeasures implemented to prevent a recurrence of the incident. Status of safety related training is reviewed, as well as any required monitoring.\nThe COVID-19 crisis has been the first big Health and Safety issue worked on with health and safety specialists from the entire Stellantis scope. It has served as an opportunity to build strong partnerships, network, and to have common, efficient protocols. The resultant \u201cStellantis COVID-19 Prevention Principles\u201d were communicated throughout the organization and have defined requirements, but also the criteria and description of progressive adjustment of those measures when pandemic trends improved. The best of what had been done by the previous organizations was integrated to build a safer future and was an important step toward fulfilling our Health and Safety policy.\n\nHealth and safety agreements/ Promotion of health social dialogue\n\nStellantis is committed to implement the best occupational health and safety standards and practices, and has made health and safety a top priority. This commitment is demonstrated in the Well-being, Health and Safety policy, as well as in several national Company agreements with employees representatives. Each year, health and safety agreements are signed in the countries where the Company operates. **30 health and safety agreements were signed in 2021.**\n\n3.4.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nMotivation and Well-being at work\n\nThe Stellantis Well-being Health and Safety (WHS) organization is staffed with professionals dedicated to their field. The WHS team is deployed around the globe to implement the ideals of the Wellness, Health and Safety policy at the corporate, region, country, cluster, and site levels. The varied skill sets of Stellantis WHS professionals cover the entire scope of WHS services at the appropriate levels, with responsibilities ranging from technical safety to wellness, and ergonomics.\n\nErgonomics: strong asset\n\nThe team of **80 Stellantis ergonomists** works with the objective of promoting ergonomics to improve overall efficiency within the Company. This team is divided into three teams:\n\n- the Trade Ergonomists team is responsible for standards development and ensuring the deployment of the Company\u2019s guidelines and tools;\n- the Project Ergonomists team works with Manufacturing engineering to ensure that ergonomic standards are met when purchasing and installing new equipment and new programs;\n- the Site Ergonomists team analyzes and improves ergonomics at their respective facilities.\n\nThe objective of each team is to design a user interface adapted to physical capabilities, to prevent the deterioration of working conditions and its consequences both on individuals (e.g. health, particularly musculoskeletal diseases) and on the related costs for Stellantis (loss of full-time equivalents, cost of occupational diseases, etc.).\n\nMedical resources\n\nStellantis Health teams are dedicated to the care of employees while respecting their right to confidentiality and professional secrecy. The Health related information collected through internal occupational Health services is kept under the responsibility of the physician in charge, supported by the country Health coordination. Many countries implement an IT solution to store them, implement and monitor the Occupational Health processes. **Each IT solution is compliant with the country regulation.**\n\nFulfilling requirements of local regulations, that differ from country to country, a team of **488 physicians and 527 nurses focus on prevention, occupational follow-up, emergency care and health promotion.** No matter if legally required local workers at all Stellantis sites have access to medical resources. Stellantis believes that health has to be taken as a holistic matter and achieving occupational health goals requires improvement of the comprehensive health of the employee.\n\nPrevention covers the activities dedicated to occupational risks and exposure assessment related to any health consequence from work activities. Occupational follow up includes monitoring, examinations to check for exposure consequence, assess fitness to work and any potential limitations. It includes individual follow up by physicians, trained nurses, physiotherapist, and/or psychologist to take into account early symptoms before requiring long or complex treatment and fosters sustainable employability.\n\nEmergency care is organized in every facility with internal resources or external support to address critical medical situations.\nTraining and prevention programs\n\nBased on accident analysis and risk assessment, specific training programs are developed and deployed at all sites. In 2021, 363,410 hours of training were dedicated to safety and, in addition, 259,517 hours of training in the COVID-19 health protocol were delivered before returning to work.\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, most of our Health promotion activities have been targeting COVID-19 and some of the consequences like Mental Health, lack of physical activity, remote work and sedentary.\n\nMusculo skeletal disorders are the most common work related issues. To prevent them, a comprehensive program is implemented. This program takes in account the workstation and product design, ergonomic assessment and improvement, risk factors avoidance, but also occupational health follow-up, fitness to work process, out-patient clinics, and strategies to take in account early discomfort felt during work. On the other hand, the health promotion and physical activity promotion programs are implemented.\n\nDeafness and noise prevention is based on the implementation of the risk assessment, communication about the risk level and the protective equipment to get protected from them. Risks reductions programs, as well as medical surveillance are implemented.\n\nRelated illnesses to Asbestos are outcomes of past exposures.\n\nAnd the last main types of work-related ill health is others including carrying heavy loads. Each work related illness lead to a comprehensive root causes analysis and related action plan to avoid other cases to occur.\n\n363,410\n\nTraining hours dedicated to safety\n\n2,000 managers received the training \u201cCreating the Conditions for Sustainable Performance\u201d, designed to provide the necessary awareness on psychosocial risks, and leadership behaviors necessary to associate a high level of demand and change with concern for the well-being of each team member.\n\nRegarding COVID-19 in Italy, the Organismo Paritetico Health and Safety (OPHS) is an unrecognized association pursuant to art. 36 of the Italian Civil Code. The OPHS was able to carry out training activities in the Health and Safety area which, despite the COVID-19 crisis, continued according to schedule.\n\nAudits\n\nCOVID-19 audits are an important tool not only to check the implementation of prevention measures and the way issues are fixed, but also provide good understanding of the priorities of the Company. In the COVID-19 crisis, audit has been implemented at many stages, from the readiness of the facilities to safely welcome employees to the sustained implementation of prevention measures. The COVID-19 audit program (with 100 questions covering the full array of COVID-19 protocols) provided the impetus to fix issues discovered related to the prevention protocol implementation. We deployed those audits on sites with the support of local teams (dedicated auditors in each site) but also auditors from the regional Health and Safety teams and from the Compliance Organization. Employee representatives were also involved in this process. In 2021, a total of 553 COVID-19 related audits have been implemented worldwide.\n\nIn North America, COVID-19 audits have been conducted since the start of the pandemic by a multifunctional team including the corporate audit office, Health and Safety, Operating Management, and Labor Union representatives to assure protective measures and consistent compliance with a robust program of protective measures and hygiene.\n\nHealth and Safety Audits, after a pause in 2020, began again in 2021. Though the audits once again took place, they were conducted somewhat differently. Due to the pandemic, portions of all audits were completed through virtual interfaces. Some management system audits were completed entirely over an internet connection and tools like google glass and GoPro cameras. Due to the success of these virtual audits, Stellantis will continue to integrate the use of web tools to conduct health and safety audits, though certainly there are audits that will require an in person experience. Done properly, virtual or in person, audits find not only potential deficiencies, but also best practices to be shared throughout the organization.\n3.4.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nManufacturing System Integration\n\nDuring 2021, the World Class Manufacturing (WCM) methodologies and tools, including a Health and Safety pillar, adopted throughout the former FCA, and the Production Excellence System, implemented at former PSA sites, were thoroughly revised and merged to create the new Stellantis Production Way (SPW).\n\nIn the SPW, Health and Safety remains a fundamental pillar, dedicated to improving health and safety in a systematic manner by involving the entire manufacturing organization and encompassing all phases of production. It includes a combination of preventive measures and collaboration of employees. Employees are involved through training that focuses on the importance of safeguarding health and safety; complying with policies and procedures; and promoting appropriate prevention behaviors across all organizational levels and roles. They are also engaged in initiatives designed to increase safety awareness and participate in a comprehensive system for gathering feedback and suggestions. Useful and implementable ideas are put into practice, shared across multiple facilities, with the project owners recognized for their involvement.\n\nThe SPW Health and Safety applies risk identification and assessment, both on a routine and non-routine basis, with the purpose of singling out major risk areas and implementing preventive action plans. Risk areas include physical, ergonomic, chemical and psychosocial risks. The Hierarchy of Controls methodology is then used to determine the proper countermeasures.\n\nThe Stellantis Well-being, Health and Safety commitments (our \u201cWe All Care\u201d program) have been summarized in a document signed by all the Executive Vice Presidents to highlight their support regarding those priorities for the Company. This document has been communicated internally to the Stellantis employees.\n\nMoreover, from the creation of the Company, the protection of people from transmission of the COVID-19 crisis was the first message sent to all employees by the Chief Human Resources and Transformation Officer in February 2021: \u201cOur priority is to protect our employees. It is our number one priority\u201d.\n\nHealth\n\n- **COVID-19** has been the main concern of this first year of the new Health Team of Stellantis. Common principles, rules, and tools based on the proven knowledge were devised to protect the employees, monitor potential failure in our prevention measures, to correct them if necessary, and adapt the measures as required by local situations. Beyond this, our ways of interacting with people had to change taking into account the new reality. Remote appointments, electronic surveys, and dedicated apps became the method of choice to be in contact with employees, especially COVID-19 highly vulnerable ones. Stellantis made vaccine available to our workforce and their families, directly on site or indirectly with external partners, as soon as it was possible. Despite vaccine hesitancy being a challenge in countries where vaccines are largely available, corporate Well-being Health and Safety Health professionals continue to work within their local community to provide relevant information to promote vaccination.\n\n- Health teams were committed to promote and support psychosocial risks and mental health prevention programs, especially for those who had to work remotely on a permanent and mandatory basis.\n\n- Daily activities progressively took their place again in the schedule of the health teams, such as MSD (musculoskeletal disorders) prevention and sustainable employability promotion program.\n\n- Chemical risk management involved a network of specialists and stakeholders to have a comprehensive vision of the products used within the Company, with the appropriate risk assessment, prevention measure and plan to reduce the risks to the lowest level, including a structured substitution policy.\n\n- Ergonomic evaluation and rating tools for our repetitive workstations is required in Stellantis plants. Ergonomic tools have a common principle - to measure the difficulties and the risk level for each workstation and to detect factors with the greatest risk of causing musculoskeletal disorders. To ensure the most advanced methods and tools are used, some Stellantis Ergonomists are involved in technical boards for the scientific evolution of risk assessment tools and participate in ergonomic committees to develop and revise national and ISO standards. These tools also allow us to carry out workstation mapping in project mode and in everyday life at all manufacturing sites to identify the risk level on a competitive\nmethod of approach - taking this into account as a baseline for every new project. **Stellantis introduces new technologies to serve our objectives:**\n\n- **facility enhancements**, such as rotating carriers and adjustable skillets to eliminate overhead work, improving operator posture and center of vehicle reach to strengthen capabilities;\n- where no conventional process solution is possible, exoskeletons can help reduce the physical burden of certain tasks. Benchmarking with collaboration across regions in the area of **wearable Exoskeleton technology** was completed to investigate potential future applicability. Manufacturing tryouts with exoskeletons have been performed in 11 sites of the Company;\n- **a thermography, infrared camera image**, pilot study applied at a south American Stellantis plants is a project that aims to prevent musculoskeletal injuries through early diagnosis. The basis of the project is that the inflammatory processes show signs such as heat, redness, edema, pain or loss of function that occurs before the employee feels pain. The body increases blood flow and heats the area. This allows identification of a predisposition to injuries in asymptomatic employees;\n- **a new Ergonomics Laboratory \"ErgoLab\"** has been set up in the Mirafiori plant, in Italy, with the aim of supporting plants worldwide, Manufacturing engineering sector and designers by providing them with reliable information and data to design technological systems and ergonomic workstations according to the ergonomics principles and the requirements of legislation. ErgoLAB activities will ensure the validation of new innovative technologies and their introduction based on scientific investigation for Stellantis;\n- in North America, Stellantis maintains a United States Council for Automotive Research (USCAR) affiliation with other automotive manufacturing OEMs to advance research and technology within the field of ergonomics. **Collaborative research projects to advance efficiency and accuracy of digital human model simulation software tools**, methods and standards development is also supported.\n\n**Safety**\n\nFollowing a benchmarking exercise, Stellantis adopted the globally recognized OSHA measure of Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) as the master safety KPI, supported by: Lost Time Injury Rate (LTIR); Days Away, Restricted & Transferred Rate (DARTR) and Total Injury Rate (TIR).\n\nAt December 31, 2021\nTotal Recordable Injury rate was\n\n3.8\n\nA program of serious injury and fatality elimination is strategically overseen at a global level and promoted by the development of common global standards for high-risk activities and the implementation of Global \"Call-to-Actions\", charging all sites with the implementation of common action plans to eliminate and control such high-risk hazards.\n\nHazards are systematically identified through workplace and task risk assessments and subsequently controlled. **Workers are trained to identify and report, to their line supervisor, any situation that they consider could create harm.** If a response is not forthcoming for the line supervisor, workers may raise their concerns with a H&S professional or their employee representatives.\n\nTo support the policy of reporting hazards, the corporation communicates via the Stellantis Production Way - \"Can Do\" booklet and other global communication forums the three essential behaviors for safety:\n\n- Stop if you are not trained for a task or if your safety is at risk;\n- Speak Up and intervene if you have a concern for anyone's safety;\n- Listen if someone shows concern for your safety and resolve the concern together.\n\nAt a local level, **sites have completed risk assessments for workstations and tasks that promote application of the hierarchy of controls.** They review those risk assessments after incidents and injuries occur. At a regional and global level, standards are developed that sites must assess their conformance to and progress plans to close non conformance. These standards define actions in line\nwith the hierarchy of controls and are support by good practices. The main types of work related injuries were, Laceration, primarily Finger and hand injuries, 2. Contusion 3. Strains and strains from slip/trip and fall.\n\nHigh severity, low probability type hazards are identified proactively through risk assessment and reactively as a result of either a high potential incident or a high-consequence injury.\n\nFor Example:\n- fall from heights;\n- interaction with suspended loads;\n- interaction with moving machinery and powered industrial Vehicles.\n\nA global Call to Action is in progress, across all Die and stamping shops, to verify and improve controls regarding the use of cranes to maneuver dies. The actions are coordinated globally, to identify and share the good practices, following the hierarchy of controls, in order to prevent the worker from needing to enter the \"danger zone\". Such actions include assessment and correction by design of the dies in order to avoid difficulties to position dies; use of crane and vision technology to improve accuracy of crane maneuvering; refresher training for operators and increased audits of operations.\n\nIn North America, updated in 2020 and launched in 2021, Serious Injury and Fatality (SIF) and precursor (pSIF) programs continue to be utilized to identify near miss events and activities/conditions that could lead to more serious impact, correcting or eliminating practice and conditions ahead of injury. This process tied with Artificial Intelligence (AI) will enable the North American Operations to predict and prevent risk to employees. Other initiatives have included piloting wearable technology to perform digital remote auditing. This is possible with Bluetooth technology and the use of wearable video cameras. Site audits can be performed with less labor and travel. Expertise can be consulted from thousands of miles away globally. This process was first used in our Windsor Assembly Plant Safety Audit. It is a good use of time, effort and resources.\n\n### Severity rate by geographic area\n\n|        | Enlarged Europe | North America | South America | Middle East & Africa | China and India & Asia Pacific | Total |\n|--------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------|\n| 2021   | 0.12            | 0.04          | 0.04          | 0.01                 | 0.01                          | 0.07  |\n\n### Well-being\n\nThe Stellantis holistic Well-being Program presents our common commitments wherever we operate. This We All Care (see section 3.4.5) Program is based on five pillars (Physical, Emotional, Social, Professional and Financial) and gives a common framework and ambition for the numerous actions that already exist in the regions and countries. This program includes the main changes linked to the New Era of Agility Project and the positive impact on work life balance and flexibility of work.\n\nEstablishing a collaborative work method is incorporated into the social dialog and applies to workspaces as well as the expansion of remote working. The goal is to offer more flexible work arrangements without damaging collective productivity. The New Era of Agility program allows employees to remote work up to 70% (for more information, see section 3.2). This allows employees to work from home or another location. Achieving a good work-life balance leads to better performance and prevents stress. Capitalizing on that, the Company willingly offers employees part-time schedules or teleworking arrangements when this is feasible. Where possible, the Company approves employees\u2019 requests to work part-time. The aim is to devise suitable solutions, such as part-time by the day or half day, part-time in hours, etc. Part-time hours are chosen by employees and are not imposed by the Company. In 2021, the Company had 15,056 part-time employees worldwide (including 2,637 employees who worked half-time), distributed as follows: 43% women and 57% men.\nPart-time employees by geographic area, gender and age group\n\n(number of employees)\n\n| 2021          | Women | Men | Total |\n|---------------|-------|-----|-------|\n|               | Up to 30 yo | 31-50 yo | Over 50 yo | Up to 30 yo | 31-50 yo | Over 50 yo |       |\n| Enlarged Europe | 354   | 2,557 | 663 | 956 | 2,067 | 1,049 | 8,076 |\n| North America  | 1,284 | 1,399 | 209 | 2,045 | 1,785 | 232 | 6,954 |\n| South America  | -     | 1     | -   | 4    | 4     | 1   | 10    |\n| Middle East & Africa | -   | 12    | 1   | -    | 1     | -   | 14    |\n| China and India & Asia Pacific | - | 1     | -   | -    | -     | 1   | 2     |\n| Total          | 1,638 | 3,970 | 873 | 3,005 | 3,857 | 1,713 | 15,056 |\n| Of which half-time employees | 219 | 751 | 126 | 615 | 681 | 245 | 2,637 |\n\nIn 2021, overtime accounted for 5.99% of hours worked in the Company with a total of 475,066,778 working hours.\n\nTo be able to assess the impact of our Well-being and Motivation Program \u201cWe All Care\u201d a common survey for the all Stellantis perimeter was developed that will be launched in the second quarter of 2022. It will allow the measurement of the level of motivation, well-being and stress and result in customized programs based on the survey responses.\n\nTeam Building activities organized by departments and employee clubs sponsored by the Company, and organized employees to join in some social volunteer activity.\n\nSport, Fitness and Nutrition engagements\n\nTo support our workforce in a healthy lifestyle is beneficial for the individual, the Company and society. Stellantis therefore offers a variety of health trainings, nutrition programs, sports groups, training facilities and coaches.\n\nNorth America StayWell Program (Nonsmoking, blood pressure, Sportgroups, Football club)\n\nSouth America: nutrition support in both Health care assistance, gympass program.\n\nIn France, Stellantis sponsors access to more than 50 sports and cultural events to its employees. The aim is to keep employees healthy and help the practice of sport and cultural activities in several disciplines, as well as leisure, training and business competitions activities.\n\nWorkplace social services for employees\n\nThe main role of social workers is to facilitate job integration by assisting employees dealing with issues in their personal and/or professional life that are having an impact on their occupation. Social services are a place to discuss issues and be listened to. They also provide specialist advice to managers, and help implement the corporate social policy.\n\nStellantis provides a hotline for employees with possible face-to-face follow up. Each region has its own programs that are tailored to the specific needs of the region.\n\nWorkplace social services are provided to all employees through a network of 144 internal and external social workers at office and manufacturing facilities. In North America Stellantis offers off-site Family, Health and Wellness Centers to provide medical care for our employees and their families as well as on-site Health Coaches.\n\n1 Includes 2,101 employees representing 0.7% of the total headcount, even if they belong to legal entities that are not managed within the HR consolidation tool that are not considered in other workforce KPIs.\n###

MEETING CHANGING CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS ON MOBILITY (MARKET RISKS)\n\nThe automotive market is faced with competition from established players as well as newcomers in the mobility sector, in particular digital and tech companies. It must take into account a variety of different needs and evolving contexts, considering trends such as increasing urbanization and traffic congestion, the need of customers to find mobility solutions going beyond vehicle ownership, and the contributions that technologies can provide to road users in terms of experience and safety. All these elements affect automakers strategy, operations and results as are assessed and challenged by customers and other stakeholders.\n\nStellantis understands these requirements and pays close attention to the mobility trends. We intend to provide opportunities for consumers by developing new mobility solutions with high-quality products and services with the goal to execute flawless customer relationship management.\n\nTo meet market expectations, the Company\u2019s processes and decisions are customer-focused, to design affordable, reliable, safe and high-quality products and services and complementary solutions to meet mobility needs around the world.\n\n4.1 DEVELOPMENT OF NEW MOBILITY SOLUTIONS (INCLUDING AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES)\n\n4.1.1 CONTEXT AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\nCSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE #8: Development of new mobility solutions (including autonomous vehicles)\n\nSocial, environmental and technical evolutions impact customer mobility behavior and expectations. According to a 2019 Forbes article, vehicles which were traditionally perceived as a tangible asset, are now more likely to be seen as a mobility device, especially by groups such as Millennials and Generation Z who are less interested in owning or driving a vehicle, for economical or ecological reasons and due to their specific mobility needs.\n\nThis evolution has particularly accelerated in recent years and has been embraced by more than just young generations of customers. Due to long periods of confinement during the COVID-19 crisis in many countries and the extensive deployment of remote work, 2020 and 2021 showed a completely different approach to mobility, with consequences that might have a significant impact in the years to come.\n\nAt Stellantis, we are aware of these challenges and our business model includes mobility service offerings with Free2move and Leasys, the mobility service company of FCA Bank \u2013 the equally held joint venture between Stellantis and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole. These services aim to provide customers with mobility solutions to make their lives easier. We are also working on new small electric mobility object, such as the AMI which expands practical and affordable personal mobility options for a larger potential market and provides a canvas for future logistics and delivery services.\n\nWe continue the research and development of technologies in order to develop future mobility options including means of transport such as driverless autonomous vehicles.\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nThe importance of individual choice over freedom of movement and flexible mobility means that vehicles have an important place today and in the future. Vehicles play a major role in a multi-modal ecosystem that aims at optimizing the efficiency of transport systems, particularly outside cities where alternative solutions are not always available. New uses and therefore new services are being created.\n\nShared mobility services as well as Mobility as a Service (MaaS) platforms will get more efficient as the level of driving automation increases. The purpose of Stellantis: \u201cPowered by our diversity, we lead the way the world moves\u201d means that we want to ensure freedom of movement by providing safe, sustainable, affordable and convenient mobility solutions. This is reflected in the Company\u2019s approach toward connected and autonomous mobility: a gradual development to ensure that reliability and safety requirements are met, and to ensure affordability so that all our customers and society at large can benefit from it. The Company is aware of these needs and shares its expertise with stakeholders, experts and regulators in the development of the appropriate standardization and regulatory framework. Local governments play a significant role in their climate-neutral and smart cities mission and Stellantis collaborates with these local authorities to expand their sustainability strategies. Stellantis is involved in dedicated conversations with local institutions for business opportunities aimed at promoting the kind of regulations needed to support mobility programs.\n\nThe Company is working on a variety of Vehicle to Vehicle/Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2X) applications using both short-range and long-range technologies as well as ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) applications using a wide array of technologies in order to provide connectivity and safety to all its customers. Therefore, Stellantis is supportive of in-vehicle data access based on the Extended Vehicle, as defined by various ISO Standards, and is in the process of developing a fully industrialized Extended Vehicle Web Server allowing fair, reasonable, non-discriminatory safe and secure access to vehicle data in full compliance with ISO standards.\n\nIn line with the Company\u2019s strategic vision to be not only a vehicle manufacturer but also a mobility services provider, Stellantis is implementing a complete automation roadmap from Level 1 and 2 to Level 4 (driverless vehicles), based upon clear use cases and customer requirements. We are enhancing the set of features already offered at Level 2 and launching hands-off technology in the U.S. (usually called Level 2+).\n\nLevel 3 is already under development and the Company sees, beyond Level 3, application of Level 4 technology mainly for shared mobility services like autonomous shuttles, robotaxis, and automated goods delivery.\n\nTo support the growing level of autonomy and the high safety demands connected with these technologies, the Company is investing in very advanced simulation/validation methods and creating synergies by pooling databases of relevant safety scenarios and data collected from real world driving conditions, integrated into a state-of-the-art Data Platform.\n\nIn addition, our software strategies will support the shift to become a sustainable mobility tech company, leveraging the associated business growth with over-the-air features and services, and delivering the best experience to our customers.\n### 4.1.2 Forward-Looking Vision and Targets\n\n**CSR Issue #8**  \nDevelopment of new mobility solutions (including autonomous vehicles)\n\n**Owners**  \nBrand Chief Executive Officer, Free2Move  \nChief Executive Officer, Leasys  \nChief Software Officer\n\n| CSR ISSUE | VISION / AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | 2021 RESULTS |\n|-----------|-------------------|----------------|------------|--------------|\n|           |                   | % of Low Emission Vehicles (below 50g CO\u2082 per kilometer) infleeted in the year for car sharing / short and medium term rental / subscription / long term rental (lease) | Short-term | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan) | Long-term | 12.8% |\n|           |                   | % Revenues from Low Emission Vehicles (below 50g CO\u2082 per kilometer) within Mobility (incl.

Our ability to develop and launch products with new technologies (e.g., electrification, autonomous driving and connected vehicles) to meet regulatory requirements and customer expectations is constantly challenged by technical limitations due to changes in public policies and strong validation efforts needed to ensure availability of systems at a certain time frame.\n\n- **Deterioration or disappearance of vehicle brands in favor of new mobility brands**\n  \n  The automotive industry is in the process of a fundamental transformation and vehicle brands are facing challenges posed by disruptive patterns in mobility choices. In some cities vehicle ownership is restricted due to traffic congestion and strains on local infrastructure. As automakers navigate this new mobility landscape and play a role in actively shaping this change, it will require the evolution of a century old business model shifting from traditional ownership to customer driven, flexible mobility solutions.\n\n4.1.3.2 Opportunities\n\nAt the same time, this changing mobility landscape opens opportunities for Stellantis. Mobility transformation is driven by three key trends: electrification of vehicles and alternative powertrains, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS). We embrace the challenges posed by this evolution seizing the many opportunities that will invariably accompany change. Stellantis is committed to delivering on our electrification plans, the acceleration of autonomous vehicle and connected technologies, and the continued work in developing and defining MaaS offerings through both our Free2move and Leasys services. Advanced autonomous and connected technologies will continue to drive increasing levels of safety with technology that allows users to stay continuously connected while on the move and continued deployment of driving assistance systems (ADAS) foreshadowing the autonomous vehicle.\n\n- **Provide freedom of movement through global mobility brands and enhance the image of the company**\n  \n  As our two mobility brands, Free2move and Leasys bring to Stellantis and its vehicle brands a positive image of flexibility and agile thinking, in line with both current trends and future customers\u2019 needs. Free2move and Leasys are working to define those services that not only meet the needs of individuals and businesses today but also to anticipate the use cases that will drive tomorrow\u2019s mobility.\n\n  These brands are responsive to B2B and B2C customers in search of change, in a society that is reinventing itself. The continued evolution and adoption of the technologies that enable mobility services and partnerships with other global mobility providers will enhance the perception of Stellantis and its core automotive brands.\n\n- **Leverage fleet electrification and infrastructure to meet consumer demands and regulatory emissions objectives**\n  \n  With electrification at the forefront of the global strategy of Stellantis, a significant increase in the availability of public and private charging networks is required to enable wide-scale adoption and increase consumer confidence in EVs. Stellantis through Free2move and our Free2move eSolutions is working to provide end-to-end charging and 360\u00b0 charging solutions to simplify private, business and fleet customers charging experience. Through deployed mobility services such as the Free2move and LeasysGO! Car Sharing operations, Stellantis will continue to increase the mix of EVs as a percentage of our active fleets.\n\n  As governments adopt policies favorable to electrification, Stellantis can rise to meet the needs and objectives of these programs. As an example, the adoption by the European Commission of \u201cFit for 55\u201d supports the on-going work of Free2move eSolutions in the first EV Fastcharging Network in Southern Europe enabled by renewables, energy storage and which is 100% grid integrated.\n\n- **Increase deployment of connected and autonomous vehicle technologies**\n  \n  Bringing together expertise in consumer innovations from the sustainable mobility and advanced electronics industries aims at accelerating development timelines to offer innovative in-vehicle user experiences enabled by advanced consumer electronics, Human Machine Interfaces and services that will exceed customer expectations.\nThis combination will position the Company at the forefront of global efforts to deliver a new frontier of in-cabin information and entertainment capabilities, seamlessly connected inside and outside the vehicles in which they are installed.\n\n**IMPACT MEASUREMENT OF THE ELECTRIFICATION STRATEGY**\n\nEV adoption can be accelerated by Stellantis mobility services to facilitate the use of EVs and to foster customer acceptance. Stellantis automotive subscription programs such as Leasys CarCloud, Free2move Car on Demand, and MYFREEDOM enable customers to experience an EV on a month-to-month basis. Stellantis Car Sharing programs such as LeasysGO! and Free2move Car Sharing provide additional opportunities for consumers to experience an EV on a short-duration basis as we continue to increase the mix of EVs in these fleets. Free2move and Leasys are also working to facilitate the charging experience. Through Leasys, customers can recharge for free at any Leasys Mobility Store, and the service Free2move Charge My Car enables users to find a compatible and available charging station from a European network of approximately 250,000 charging stations.\n\nSustainable mobility goes beyond simply the electrification of the fleet and seeks to align the diverse needs of a community with an inclusive, affordable approach which maximizes the utilization of existing assets. Both Leasys and Free2move have developed pay-per-use models where consumers and businesses pay for actual miles driven. Combined with asset sharing programs this has the double benefit of lowering mobility costs for our customers and maximizing vehicle utilization.\n\nThese initiatives have met with favorable market response and in 2021 the number of in-fleeted LEVs was 51,187 representing 12.8% of total vehicles in-fleeted in the year. The development of LEVs through Stellantis mobility brands enhances the ability to respond to evolving customer expectations and supports environmentally conscious consumers looking for alternatives to car ownership. Electrification also enables the emergence of new services, such as the already available Citroen Ami. These services are further reinforced through our Free2move eSolutions Joint Venture with NHOA (F2MeS). This partnership is already in the process of developing a fast charging network in Europe which will reinforce the synergy between electrification and mobility services (for more information, see section 2.5.3.2.3).\n\n**4.1.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS**\n\nStellantis\u2019 portfolio is uniquely suited to offer distinctive, sustainable mobility solutions to meet its customers\u2019 evolving needs, as they embrace electrification, connectivity, autonomous driving and shared ownership.\n\nThe Company\u2019s mobility programs are led globally by the CEOs of Free2move and Leasys, both EVPs of Stellantis and members of the Top Executive Team.\n\nEach of the two organizations is responsible for setting overall strategies to address the needs of our customers through hypothesis, testing, implementation and adaptation.

In 2021, Free2move has continued to launch its all-inclusive Car On Demand monthly car subscription without commitment in Europe and is now present in France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, UK, Germany and Los Angeles, while also supporting the growth and expansion of Free2move eSolutions and the deployment of the largest fast-charging network in Southern Europe.\n\n4.1.6.2 Autonomous Driving\n\nIn this new era of mobility, Stellantis portfolio of brands is uniquely positioned to offer distinctive and sustainable solutions to meet the evolving needs of customers, as they embrace electrification, connectivity, and autonomous driving.\n\nAutonomous vehicle technology demonstrates the ability of vehicle systems to take over an increasing number of tasks which are currently performed by the driver. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) developed a classification system that defines the degree of driving automation a vehicle and its equipment may offer.\n\nThe levels span from zero to five, with it ranging from vehicles without this technology to entirely self-driving vehicles.\n\nTo offer new services that improve the mobility experience and provide greater access to affordable solutions, the Company organization is set up to pursue a multi-partner strategy for developing advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving technologies, working with leaders in their respective industries.\n\nTaking into account the challenges and opportunities presented by the advances in autonomous driving and connectivity, we are devoting resources to research and develop an approach to address changing consumer expectations driven by growing demand for safety, convenience, connectivity and quality time.\n\nOur ongoing partnerships include major technology players in autonomous driving. In 2021 we further strengthened our ongoing partnership in the area of Automated Driving:\n\n- the co-development project with BMW of a platform scaling from L2 to L2+ and L3, has been extended up to 2024 to include not only the launch of our products but also a roadmap of additional functionalities that we will be able to distribute to customers via Over-the-Air updates;\n- the Waymo cooperation on L4 autonomy has been extended to include Light Commercial Vehicles specific use cases, which will bring several new business opportunities to the market. Stellantis and Waymo have now expanded their partnership to local delivery services. Engineering teams will get their hands on Stellantis prototypes in 2022.\nIn addition the new non-binding memorandum of understanding signed with Foxconn aims at developing four families of chips that will cover over 80% of the Company\u2019s micro-controllers\u2019 needs, helping to greatly simplify the supply chain. Adoption and installation of products into Stellantis vehicles is targeted by 2024.\n\nSeveral projects running on autonomous driving technologies, validation and safety involve many important research institutes (i.e., SystemX and VEDECOM in France). We can also leverage on majors cooperative projects in the field of ADAS, Autonomous Driving and V2X such as L3Pilot (level 3 driving pre-deployment project, see box in section 4.1.7.3), HiDrive (in use monitoring of driver for L3), C-ROADS (V2X) in Europe, successors of PEGASUS (Set L4to5, etc.), Imagine (V2X) in Germany, SAM (Scenario database for ADAS and Autonomous driving L3) in France.\n\nIn addition, the Joint Research Laboratory (Joint LAB), with Valeo and SAFRAN on Artificial Intelligence for Driving Automation (L2/L3) is noteworthy among our research partnerships, while further contracts and studies are ongoing with several startups and in the domain of ADAS, AD and AI.\nNew Tech Platforms Coming in 2024\n\nThe heart of the transformation to customer-centric services is the new electrical/electronic (E/E) and software architecture.\n\nThree new tech platforms are expected to be deployed in 2024, at scale, across the four vehicle platforms of Stellantis over the following two years:\n\n- **STLA Brain** planned to be fully OTA capable, with 30 modules addressed, versus 10 today, making it highly flexible. It is a service-oriented architecture that aims to be fully integrated with the cloud that connects electronic control units within the vehicle with the vehicle\u2019s central high performing computer (HPC) via a high-speed data bus. It is designed to break today\u2019s bond between hardware and software generations, enabling software developers to create and update features and services quickly without waiting for a new hardware launch. These OTA updates should allow to dramatically reduce costs for both the customers and Stellantis, simplify maintenance for the user and sustain vehicle residual values.\n\n- **STLA SmartCockpit**, to be built on top of STLA Brain, is intended to seamlessly integrate with the digital lives of vehicle occupants to create a customizable third living space. This platform, powered by the Mobile Drive joint venture between Stellantis and Foxconn, is expected to deliver AI-based applications such as navigation, voice assistance, e-commerce marketplace and payment services.\n\n- **STLA AutoDrive** is being developed in partnership with BMW, to offer Level 2, Level 2+ and Level 3 autonomous driving capabilities and with continuous upgrades through OTA updates.\n\n**COMPANY TRANSFORMATION THROUGH THE SOFTWARE STRATEGY**\n\nTo support the development of mobility services, including via autonomous driving, Stellantis ambitions to deploy its next-generation tech platforms, building on existing connected vehicle capabilities to generate approximately \u20ac20 billion in incremental annual revenues by 2030.\n\nThis transformation will move Stellantis\u2019 vehicles from today\u2019s dedicated electronic architectures to an open software-defined platform that seamlessly integrates with customers\u2019 digital lives.\n\n**4.1.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS**\n\n**4.1.7.1 Overall Mobility Solutions and Services**\n\nIn 2021, the following main initiatives contributed to the Stellantis results in offering products tailored to stimulate customers\u2019 approach to the new electric technologies as well as to facilitate that experience while guaranteeing maximum flexibility to reassess their needs at any time.\n\nFollow more details for a selection of mobility solutions and services offered by Stellantis.\nCUSTOMIZED AND AFFORDABLE TRANSPORT SOLUTIONS\n\nRental / Subscriptions\n\nUrban mobility / Urban car-sharing / Ride hailing\n\nFree Floating Car Sharing\n\nCar Sharing Peer to Peer\n\nLeasys Go!\nUrban car-sharing, 100% digital and electric\n\nLeasys I-Share corporate car-sharing\n\nLeasys Miles Pay-per-use long term rental, monthly fee varying with mileage\n\nLeasys Unlimited\nLong-term rental product with unlimited mileage for LEV vehicles\n\nLeasys\nLong term rental services for corporate and private customers\n\nRental\nShort-term rental service\n\nLeasys Car Cloud\nMonthly car subscription, unlimited changes of vehicle at any Leasys Mobility Stores, flexible with no time commitment\n\nLeasys Carbox\nOn-demand car subscription up to 240 days (fixed monthly fee)\n\nCar On Demand\nMonthly car subscription without commitment\n\nFleXent 30\nFlexible car rental for 30 or 90 days\n\nFleXent 90\n\nLeasys Miles\n\nLeasys\n\nMAKE LIFE EASIER\n\nMobility services/ Assistance and maintenance\n\nTraffic management / Charging options\n\nPark\n500,000 parking lots in 65 countries\n\nAccessing a home charging stations\n\nLeasys e-Card\nLeasys e-Card Enables activation of a wide range of charging stations including, free of charge, Leasys e-parking charging points\n\nParking\nCharging station at Leasys Mobility Stores, dedicated parking and free electricity\n\nCharge My Car\n250,000 terminals in Europe\n\nLeasys I-Care\nDigital application for monitoring of fleet performance and preventive maintenance\n\nUconnect cloud-based platform to power connectivity, offering a full array of services and deliver an enhanced user experience\n\nTomTom Traffic Connected Navigation\n\nSmarter Cities\n\nBUSINESS SOLUTIONS\n\nFleet solutions\n\nMobility Advisor\nAdvice solution for corporate transition to electric mobility\n\nLeasys\nLong term rental services for corporate and private customers\n\nConnect Fleet\nFleet handling for PHEV, for medium-sized and large business\n\nMasternaut (Fleet Management)\n\nServices Developed by Stellantis\n\nPartnerships\n4.1.7.1.1 CUSTOMIZED AND AFFORDABLE TRANSPORT SOLUTIONS\n\n**Free2move**\n\n**F2M MOBILITY HUB:** The complete collection of F2M services offered to customers through a Mobility Hub provides a full spectrum ecosystem that is flexible to meet nearly any mobility need (by the minute, by the day and by the month).\n\nThe combination of services also simplifies access to additional services to support a consumers\u2019 journey such as the reservation of parking spaces, car with drivers (VTC Ride), access to EV charging stations etc., all accessible either on the website (link) or via the Free2move mobile app in 170 countries:\n\n- **Carsharing**\n  - **Car-sharing:** In Madrid, Paris, Portland, Washington D.C., Denver, and other cities by the end of 2022, it is possible to locate more than 2,200 cars in an instant.\n\n- **Rent**\n  - **Rent:** In more than 170 countries, relying on its network of franchisees, dealers and partners, Free2Move provides access to more than 450,000 vehicles on a daily rental basis.\n\n- **Car On Demand**\n  - **CarOnDemand:** For even more flexibility, Free2move offers its customers a subscription service that allows them to rent vehicles of multiple brands on a monthly basis and without any time commitment.

We know that exceptional quality is the forerunner to economic growth and customer loyalty. The key factors for customer loyalty are customer satisfaction, positive customer experiences and the overall value of the goods or services a customer receives from a business. Strong relationships with customers lead to increased customer loyalty. At Stellantis, we are focused on increasing the reliability of our products, our ability to understand customer mobility needs that vary across markets, vehicle service quality, customer advocacy and improving customer relationship processes and communication channels.\n\nWe adhere to regulatory requirements and we incorporate best practices to provide comprehensive information to customers, such as information related to warranties, repair and replace services, and along with applying certified international quality standards (e.g., IATF 16949 specific to the automotive industry) in our processes.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nIn the era of multi-channel and customer centric communication, the relationship has switched from a transactional approach to a personal approach, in which the customer is the central focus, clearly demonstrated in our corporate values which include \u201cWe are Customer Centric\u201d. The Company is committed to a proactive approach, listening closely to its customers so as to improve their experience throughout an optimized and individualized customer journey.\n\nA broad range of services are available, ensuring a customer centric response. This is true for services during the vehicle sale reception, advice, getting to know the vehicle, financing and insurance options by the dedicated companies in Stellantis and after the vehicle sale handling, maintenance, repair and spare parts replacement.\n\nStellantis\u2019 approach to innovation is about meeting the new expectations of its customers. While differing from one country to the next, those new expectations nevertheless follow a few key trends, namely the shift from ownership to experience, calls for progress for everyone, and the very highest security and safety standards. We participate in discussions and quality councils with industry associations, e.g. AIAG, where teams of volunteers from OEMs and suppliers collaborate on the way to solve issues that are common to the automotive industry. For economic, environmental and social reasons, the automotive world is transitioning from the era of the vehicle to that of mobility. Stellantis\u2019 innovation strategy for 2030 is consistent with that paradigm shift and aims to respond to the changing needs of customers.\n### 4.2.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\n| CSR ISSUE | VISION / AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | 2021 RESULTS |\n|-----------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|--------------|\n| CSR issue #9 | Vehicle and service quality - Customer satisfaction | Be TOP1 in syndicated surveys in customer satisfaction with excellent quality vehicles, services and mobility, providing a seamless customer journey, worldwide\u00b9 | Customer satisfaction: presence rate of Stellantis brands in the first quartile of the product and service syndicated surveys, in the main markets.

As results are confidential, they are given using a base 100 2021\n\u2074 This KPI is based on syndicated surveys results. Base 100 2021 means that 2021 results are used as a reference and converted to 100. Future results will be compared to 2021 and presented as percentage of evolution\n4.2.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n4.2.3.1 Risks\n\nQuality has an important impact on customer satisfaction and loyalty. The potential loss of customers and negative brand image are risks that the organization pays close attention to via customer feedback methods.\n\nAs an illustration of these risks, the results of one of our surveys (see items 1 and 2) show that the more problems a vehicle has the less likely it is that a customer will remain loyal to the brand.\n\n1. Survey results regarding the relationship between incidents and product quality satisfaction score\n\nCustomers are asked to provide their experience during the first 90 days of vehicle ownership.\n\nWe can see that a customer who has not had a vehicle problem within the first 90 days gives a 9.00 average satisfaction score while a customer who has had three problems gives a 7.77 average satisfaction score.\n\nImpact of number of problem on OSAT score\n\n2. Survey results regarding the relationship between loyalty and product quality\n\nWhen customers experience problems with their vehicles, we risk losing brand loyalty, which becomes a negative financial impact for Stellantis. The probability of a customer repurchasing the same brand as their previous vehicle is:\n\n- 23% when a satisfaction score of 5 is given for their previous vehicle;\n- 50% when a satisfaction score of 9 is given for their previous vehicle.\n\nImpact of OSAT with the previous car on Loyality to the brand\n\n---\n\n1 Scope of the survey: Results May 2021\nAll brands sold in the 5 major markets in Europe: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom\nDeliveries between September 2019 and August 2020\nQuestionnaire sent to customers after three months of ownership\n3. Survey results regarding the relationship between loyalty to the brand and aftersales satisfaction\n\nWhen customers have a positive aftersales service experience, the potential for loyalty to the brand and official dealers\u2019 network is increased. Higher customer satisfaction with the service experience leads to higher brand loyalty rates.\n\n2021 U.S. Customer Service Index Study (CSI) as of March 2021\n\n**Brand Loyalty Rate**\n\n![Brand Loyalty Rate Chart]\n\n| CSI Score Category mix | 21% | 19% | 23% | 37% |\n|------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 700 and Less           |     |     |     |     |\n| 701 to 850             |     |     |     |     |\n| 851 to 950             |     |     |     |     |\n| 951 and Higher         |     |     |     |     |\n\n1.

Applying the findings from customer surveys supports decisions on the most beneficial way to deploy resources.\n\nStellantis has the opportunity to strengthen customer satisfaction regarding vehicle and service quality.\n\nWe work to develop and implement initiatives that are designed to create a positive customer experience. We are implementing several innovative initiatives to attract and retain customers.\n\n- **Innovation in manufacturing quality**\n  \n  To support the continuous improvement approach to the quality of our products, Stellantis has implemented an innovation based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. These improvements have made it possible to automate various control stations throughout the production line, vehicle and mechanical component factories to verify the quality of the manufacturing process.\n\n- **Product predictive maintenance**\n  \n  We work consistently on trying to anticipate failures such as ones that requiring towing, and more quickly identifying the root cause of complex failures. The goal is that the vehicle spends as little time as possible at the dealership and that the customer is more satisfied.\n\n- **Used vehicle e-commerce solution**\n  \n  A used vehicle purchase module has been developed to provide customers speed, fluidity and transparency in the used vehicle purchase process.\n\nRefer to section 4.2.7 for more information on the initiatives.\n4.2.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nThe Customer Experience organization represents the customer\u2019s voice inside Stellantis and it is their mission to satisfy the customer\u2019s expectations. The Chief Customer Experience Officer is an EVP, reporting to the CEO, a member of the Top Executive Team and the Strategic Council, and has the responsibility to decide when vehicles meet the needs of customers and are ready to be sold around the world. The Officer defines quality targets for product and services and the mid-term plan, which covers three years, and is reviewed with the Top Executive Team twice a year to ensure we are challenging ourselves to meet the ever-changing market. In order to meet these targets around the world, the Officer delegates the authority to local business units and plant Directors to capture their market needs and expedite the results.\n\nThe authority is defined in the Quality Policy, which governs the teams throughout the whole value chain: from the design of our products and our services, to the support of each of our customers, everywhere in the world.\n\nTo ensure that the Quality Policy is in compliance, the Quality Management System (QMS) is used to identify the requirements linked to quality results. These requirements are the basis for the Company\u2019s operational processes and quality standards, which are continuously improved. The results from the field assessments support the conclusion that the QMS is efficient and makes it possible to identify improvement actions.\n\nThe heads of Customer Experience of the divisions and the regions control the implementation of the Quality Policy and are responsible for their QMS. They involve all the players with whom the Company works with in the extended company such as suppliers, industrial partners, subsidiaries, importers and commercial networks to ensure the achievement of Quality results. Each region reports its results during the monthly Business Review led by the CEO.\n\nIn manufacturing \u2013 in compliance with the regulatory requirements of the countries or regions in which we operate \u2013 Stellantis plants are certified according to the standards:\n\n- ISO 9001 for vehicle manufacturing plants;\n- ISO 9001 or IATF 16949 for powertrain and raw materials plants.\n\nThe Company\u2019s quality governance is global:\n\n- the Chief Customer Experience Officer reports to the CEO. This role manages the Corporate Customer Experience Division, oversees the Heads of Customer Experience of the regions, brands and other corporate divisions, and ensures that the Company meets its quality objectives;\n- the Customer Experience teams in the Company Divisions oversee operational managers, provide technical guidelines that include expectations to reach quality targets in all regions;\n- the Customer Experience teams in the regions are in charge of the quality of the region\u2019s products and services, as well as plants and points of sale.\n\nMembers of the Top Executive Team, including the Chief Customer Experience Officer, identify and confirm the strategic quality ambitions and guide the quality initiatives of the business units and regions. Stellantis has set quality targets consistent with its ambition in customer satisfaction. The Customer Experience Division performs internal and external communication throughout the year to disseminate the concept of being customer-centric through technical and soft skills training, supplier quality meetings and internal communication channels.\n\nConvergence between former Groupe PSA and former FCA has been defined and built in 2021.\n\n4.2.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nThe Stellantis Quality Policy was signed by the CEO and communicated to employees worldwide.\n\nManagers have to ensure that everyone on their team is aware of the policy and implements the actions to support it within their scope.\n\nFor Stellantis, being TOP1 means: being the best in customer satisfaction with excellent quality vehicles, services and mobility, providing a seamless customer journey, worldwide.\nThis includes:\n\n- Customer Experience being at top level;\n- Targeting zero defects on products and zero complaints regarding the services for our brands;\n- Sustainable Quality throughout the product life cycle;\n- Exemplary responsiveness to customer feedback.\n\nAll Stellantis brands compete to be TOP 1 in syndicated surveys in all their major markets. Through our Quality Policy, we commit to implement actions to reach this ambition.\n\nThe commitment of everyone to think \u201cQuality FIRST\u201d: we are a customer-centric Company focused on providing best-in-class customer experience through our behavior, decisions and actions, at all levels of the Company. For example:\n\n- we define the quality objectives in the planning phase program of new products and new services;\n- at each step, we check the conformity of the result with the defined requirements;\n- we react immediately to defects, whether these defects are detected when the vehicle is still in our hands or after the vehicle has been handed over;\n- we capitalize on the analysis of our findings to avoid recurrence and to improve our performance.\n\nWe also engage our suppliers and our partners in achieving our quality ambitions:\n\n- by associating them directly in the analysis of issues and risks in a timely manner;\n- by being responsible and accountable for the quality of their deliverables at each phase of development;\n- by not hesitating to be intrusive and to escalate if necessary.\n\nStellantis has an operational Quality Management System. It is a sustainable means to achieve our Quality Ambition.\n\nThe Stellantis Quality Management System (QMS):\n\n- defines the quality requirements for the processes in our value chain;\n- defines the quality fundamentals whose rigorous application makes it possible to achieve the results.\n\nWe apply our Quality Policy throughout the Company\u2019s value chain, from the design of our products and services to the support of our customers, whether digital or physical, anywhere in the world.\n\nStellantis employees are engaged from early phases such as strategy, planning and programming to sales and after-sales, for our products, services and mobility services.\n\nOur collective engagement is supervised by qualified people with high level technical and managerial skills. The Customer Experience Department is an independent function of Stellantis focused on compliance with the commitments made for Quality. Each manager, including those in the commercial networks, is responsible for ensuring compliance with standards, the conformity of results and the performance of processes within their scope.\n\n4.2.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nIn accordance with our policy, quality is everyone\u2019s business. To make this be a reality, we have regular trainings and communication.\n\n800 employees in the corporate Customer Experience division and 15,200 (including hourly people working in plants) in the quality job family act directly, in their everyday job, for the customer satisfaction.\n\n4.2.6.1 Resources deployed to improve the quality of products\n\nTo ensure a total satisfaction of our customers, Stellantis employees respect the quality requirements and apply the quality processes defined for each and every step of the value creation chain (design and development, manufacturing, sales and aftersales including suppliers management).\n\n- **Design and engineering phase**\n\n  The shape, style and lines of a vehicle are direct contributors to the sales of vehicles and based on customer perception of quality. Finish, robustness and the materials used inside and outside, play an important role in the customer\u2019s perception of quality. Perceived quality is a major factor in a customer\u2019s purchasing decision.\nStellantis aims to position each future model at the highest customer satisfaction level of each of its automotive brands. More than 1,500 characteristics have been identified, which contribute to the impression of perceived quality. Specific evaluation tools and technical benchmarks are used to drive vehicle projects to the expected Quality level.\n\n- **Performance and reliability during use of the vehicle**\n  Quality of product performance is based on customer expectations for a given segment, enriched by the brand experience it conveys. Around 40 different main standards e.g., visibility, seat comfort, etc., are defined for verification. The Company strives to position each future model among or above the best for customer satisfaction within its competitive segment. For initial quality and reliability, Stellantis strives for achieving the highest level delivered to the customer. Several well-structured preventive processes are applied at each step including design, development and manufacturing within the Company and from suppliers. Design takes into account the specific usage of products in all selling regions with appropriate endurance driving sessions to simulate and better understand specific vehicle performance over time.\n\n- **Quality-in-use to preserve value of the vehicle**\n  Quality-in-use criteria encompasses the aesthetic, aging of materials, tolerance of harsh treatment resulting from daily use, and functional aspects like background noises and loss of minor performances. Stellantis improves vehicle quality in order to reduce signs of aging and wear and tear, with the intention for the vehicle to look as close to new after years of customer usage as possible. This has an important impact on the resale value which is a significant pillar for customers and the Company. Bringing the quality of the vehicle to optimum used-vehicle standard is an important factor that affects the resale value. Specific vehicle aging tests are conducted to improve the baseline design requirements and to manage the aging of the vehicle over time to improve the scope of usage and strengthen the resale value.\n\n**COMPANY TRANSFORMATION THROUGH THE SOFTWARE STRATEGY**\n\nStellantis\u2019 vehicles transformation to an open software-defined architecture greatly expands the options customers will have to add innovative features and services via regular over-the-air (OTA) updates keeping vehicles fresh, exciting and updated years after they have been built.\n\nThose OTA updates are expected to be available quickly without waiting for a new hardware, and dramatically reduce costs for both the customers and Stellantis, simplify maintenance for the user and sustain vehicle residual values.\n\n- **Durability for long-term use**\n  Customers expect a vehicle that ages well and does not incur excessive future expenditure. Durability is the performance of the vehicle over time, factoring in the variability of customer use. The goal is to ensure product performance without major loss of functionality over time and without breakdown or defect. The Company is aiming to be in a leading role in quality as one of the major pillars that leads to customer satisfaction. Stellantis has set up a continuous improvement process to target the best-in-class position in durability for each product or sub-system.\n\n- **Manufacturing quality**\n  The manufacturing quality system is based on the Stellantis Production Way (SPW):\n  - the Company controls the quality at the workstation, in some production quality gates during the process and in the final inspection line to ensure the quality level of the manufactured vehicle. There are 1,800 functional and aesthetic characteristics checked on every vehicle;\n  - vehicles are tested daily by professional operators in static and driving tests on specially designed tracks and on roads outside the plant;\n  - the Customer Experience division ensures plant audits in order to verify requirements.\n\nThe processes and KPIs are in compliance with the Company\u2019s reference standards. To achieve the highest quality level in all manufacturing plants, best practices are being deployed.\nSupplier quality management and development\n\nThe Company\u2019s Purchasing Department works to ensure supplier quality management and development by:\n\n- usage of an Advanced Product Quality Planning and a Production Part Approval Process;\n- checking key processes and certifications such as critical supplier management;\n- defining supplier KPIs such as warranty performance;\n- a supplier surveillance system with defined countermeasures and permanent personal contact with each supplier manufacturing location.\n\nOur approach is global and actions are adapted to the most demanding customer expectations, taking into account regional wants and needs, in order to handle perceived quality, quality-in-use and durability of our products. The same analysis, processing and feedback standards are also applied for vehicles produced by our joint ventures.\n\n4.2.6.2 Strategy and means deployed for a high-level quality of service and customer experience\n\nStellantis aims to provide an experience that delights each customer by:\n\n- The excellence of the relationship throughout the customer journey\n  - The customer\u2019s journey with our brands begins well upstream of the act of purchase and continues throughout the use of the vehicle or mobility service. Through digital and physical interactions with the brand, the customer can discover the product or the mobility service and become interested in it before committing to purchase. The relationship with the brand continues throughout the use of the vehicle or the service;\n  - the quality of service covers the entire relationship between the customer and the Company. The entire journey is a major contributor to the excellence of the customer experience at every point of contact.\n  - to achieve this quality of service, the Customer Experience function relies on teams and systems in each region.\n\n- High-level operational skills for the service of customers\n  - The business centers describe the tasks for zone managers and each key function of the dealership. In a sales team, for example, this includes dealership personnel such as the sales manager, sales assistant, sales consultant and delivery manager;\n  - since 2018, to strengthen the customer-centric and interaction-centric mind-set, special attention has been paid to training sales advisors on behavioral skills, an essential complement to expertise and application of working standards;\n  - the training policy applies to key sales and technical positions at the point of sale. In 2021, the dealer networks provided 8.6 million hours of training (classroom and remote);\n  - the accreditation program is an international program intended for all personnel in contact with customers, performed by our retailers, that assesses technical and behavioral skills.\n\n- Applying efficient processes to achieve results\n  - To ensure the application of processes and the achievement of results:\n    - within each point of sale, each manager conducts checks on the application of standards which are complemented by Zone Manager internal audits;\n    - external audits are carried out annually on the application of operational standards;\n    - frequent mystery call and shopping provides evaluation and opportunities to demonstrate respect for the customer experience and behaviors desired by brands;\n    - yearly internal audits are conducted by the Customer Experience team.\n  - Deviations identified during these audits are the subject of action plans, which are monitored at local and country levels.\n  - New processes are evaluated to measure knowledge of the customer experience, including shopper survey and Quality Observer.\nManagement of the quality of service provided in each country\n\nThe Stellantis roadmap is defined for the period 2022-2030. This roadmap makes it possible to steer the convergence and achievement of our objectives.\n\nEach country is responsible for its annual Quality of Service Plan, structured around main actions:\n\n- assessment of skills and implementation of training plans;\n- deployment of operational standards in each point of sale, standards which embody and guarantee all the requirements of the brands, which each point of sale must comply with;\n- quality control delivered by each point of sale, and reduction of dispersion between points of sale;\n- treatment of deviations identified during checks and audits.\n\nThe identification of gaps makes it possible to define the priority actions to be implemented to achieve the objectives.\n\nThe annual quality of service plan for each Country is monitored by the Regions with the support of the Corporate Functions; its day-to-day animation is handled by the monthly Country Quality Committees.\n\nThe quality of service is one of the major components of the sales policy applied by us in each country with its sales and after-sales network.\n\nA structured system for listening to the voice of customers throughout the journey\n\nTo monitor its quality of service, Stellantis relies on a vast survey system:\n\n- benchmark surveys concerning the purchase and delivery of the vehicle and after-sales interventions, carried out in most of the countries where the Group operates, to position each brand vis-\u00e0-vis the competition and better target expectations customers have, depending on the market;\n- online surveys made by Stellantis to the customers after purchasing the vehicle and after each contact with the after-sales service. In 2021, 6.3 million customers, of which 1.5 million for sales surveys and 4.8 for aftersales surveys, responded in 56 countries worldwide. This system gives customers complete freedom, they can answer questions at the most convenient time for them and freely formulate their answers. The concerned dealer is alerted in real time on any dissatisfaction and is due to react in less than 48 hours;\n- these surveys are supported by online customer experience platforms, which allow each point of sale to challenge itself in relation to country, region and zone results. These platforms make it even more simple and easy to use verbatim results from surveys, and allow the monitoring of individual customer satisfaction. In addition to aggregating data for trend analysis, these platforms allow the network to receive and respond to customer feedback in real time. Staff can be alerted to new comments through a mobile app, allowing them to immediately contact an individual customer, if needed;\n- a plan is underway to converge the platforms within each region, monitor the major contact points of the customer journey, integrate social media such as Google or Advisor to obtain a global vision of the customer experience in each brand and strengthen action synergies.\n\nCustomer Care\n\nThere are dedicated customer care organizations in all regions to manage customer engagement activities worldwide. Customer Care is the primary point of communication between customers and the Company; it provides support through a variety of channels including telephone, chat, email, online and from the vehicle. Stellantis operates 42 contact centers worldwide, with approximately 2,150 agents and supervisors. Customer Care handles more than 11.5 million of contacts per year, offering a variety of services including requests for information, complaint management, roadside assistance and sales leads. The contact centers provide multilingual support with a strong focus on employing native speakers of 29 languages.\n\nStellantis believes that skilled, knowledgeable and motivated agents are essential for a high level of customer satisfaction. For this reason, in 2021, more than 30,000 hours of training have been delivered to agents and team leaders on new products, customer handling behaviors, processes, systems and new procedures.\nAMAZON AND STELLANTIS COLLABORATION FOR CUSTOMER-CENTRIC CONNECTED EXPERIENCES\n\n\u201cWe will transform our vehicles into personalized living spaces and enhance the overall customer experience\u201d, declared CEO of Stellantis C. Tavares.\n\nTogether, the two companies will create a suite of software-based products and services that seamlessly integrate with customers\u2019 digital lives and add value over time through regular over-the-air (OTA) software updates:\n\n- Amazon and Stellantis will collaborate to deliver software solutions for new digital cabin platform, STLA SmartCockpit, starting in 2024\n- Stellantis selects AWS (Amazon Web Services) as its preferred cloud provider for vehicle platforms to deliver on its long-term, software-focused vision\n- AWS and Stellantis will launch collaborative engineering and innovation initiatives and tools to accelerate time to market for new digital products and upskill Stellantis\u2019 global workforce\n\nAmazon will be the first commercial customer for the new Ram ProMaster Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) in 2023, further expanding Amazon\u2019s sustainable delivery network.\n\n4.2.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\n4.2.7.1 Innovation Initiatives\n\nAfter sales Service accessible 24/7\n\nService 24/7 is a new digital service providing aftersales customers a free tool that is simple, fast and secure, allowing them to drop off and pick up their vehicle at the dealership whenever they want, using a secure self-service kiosk. Customers can go online or call to make an appointment for aftersales services such as maintenance, repair, bodywork and courtesy or rental vehicles, then finalize the transaction through a secured automatic self-service terminal.\n\nThe customer can drop off the vehicle key and registration certificate at the kiosk, while payment for the service is made online. Once the vehicle service has been completed, the customer is informed by text that they can pick up their key and documents at any time from this same kiosk, then pick up the car from the dedicated parking area. The result provides dealership options that are simple, convenient and no added cost. The option aims to provide the same quality of service as using the traditional service reception.\n\nService 24/7 was piloted in Massy and Marseille, France. The pilot was successful based on the average satisfaction index of 4.8 out of 5 with more than 1,400 customers in two years. Approximately 55% of the transactions were made outside of the dealership\u2019s business hours.\n\nThis system is now implemented across 31 Stellantis owned retail sites of which 28 in France and three in Belgium, for Peugeot, Citro\u00ebn, DS Automobiles, Opel and Vauxhall. We are integrating IT systems to continue the rollout to more countries and more Stellantis brands. Find out more about Service 24/7 at this link.\n\nStellantis owned retail develops its used vehicle e-commerce solution: a 100% digital and personalized customer journey\n\nWith SelliWay, a module integrated with the used vehicle bee2link expert tool, Stellantis Owned Retail has a solution that enables 100% of the sale of used vehicles online, from vehicle trade-in to e-payment and delivery. This model aims to meet the expectations of used vehicle customers in terms of speed, fluidity and transparency.\n\nFrom the first contact with the online sales agent, the customer is guided step-by-step through all key stages of the purchase process, appraisal and online rating when there is a vehicle trade-in, real-time presentation of the used vehicle in the Spoticar national inventory matched to the customer\u2019s choice, visualization of the chosen vehicle, online offer and secure payment.\n\nThe addition of video, live chat and e-signature make the journey simple and convenient for the customer. During the proof of concept from December 2020 to April 2021 in Belgium, 10% of total used vehicle sales were made through this channel, without in person customer contact.\n\nThe rollout of the tool is planned for all Stellantis Owned Retail European subsidiaries.\nIn 2021, the system was launched in Belgium, Spain, France, Italy and Portugal. In 2022, Germany, Austria and Poland are planned to launch. The targeted brands are Peugeot, Citro\u00ebn, DS Automobiles, Opel and Vauxhall. We are integrating IT systems to continue the rollout to more Stellantis brands. The same process is being developed for the sale of new vehicles. Find out more about this tool at this link.\n\nInnovation in manufacturing quality\n\nAs part of a continuous improvement approach to the quality of its products, an innovation based on Artificial Intelligence technology has made it possible to automate various control stations throughout the production line vehicle and mechanical component factories. The first control station was installed in the Sochaux factory, France, at the end of 2020 and has proven the efficiency of the process. Stellantis has invested several millions of euros in 2021 in the implementation of 26 control stations in its various factories of which 8 are fully operational. The target is to install such stations in more factories in the coming years.\n\nProduct predictive maintenance\n\nStellantis works on trying to anticipate failures such as ones that require towing, and more quickly identifying the root cause of complex failures. These failures sometimes have random behavior and require lengthy investigations which take the customer\u2019s vehicle out of use.\n\nIn 2020, analytical methods using data science models were implemented to help the dealership troubleshoot complex breakdowns and replace the right part. This experimental phase has shown its potential on failures whose origin was uncertain, variable with temperature, required several interventions by the technician and several returns of the vehicle to the dealership service.\n\nThe next step is the scaling of these methods and their use upstream of the intervention of the dealership service. This involves real-time information collection on the condition of the vehicle to anticipate a vehicle out of use failure. This innovative method uses data from the connected vehicle. There are tests on a large fleet of vehicles underway and a pilot phase is due to start in early 2022.\n\n4.2.7.2 Achievements\n\nAt Stellantis, we measure Product Quality through several surveys, KPIs and external sources to be sure multiple aspects of the customer experience are monitored and evaluated:\n\n- Product satisfaction is measured as the percentage of models in the first quartile of their competitive segment.\n\nSurveys show that customers are more and more satisfied with the Stellantis models. The percentage of Stellantis models ranked in the first quartile of their competitive segment about satisfaction with the product was 24% for vehicles sold in Model Year 2018, and 31% for vehicles sold in Model Year 2020. The scope of the surveys is:\n\n- all brands in U.S., Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, China, Japan and Turkey;\n- questionnaires are sent to customers after approximately three to four months of ownership.\n\nThese are some examples of ranking according to this product satisfaction measurement provided by syndicated surveys:\n\n- in the U.S., two of our five brands are in the top 3;\n- in China, two of our four brands are in the first quartile of their competitive segment;\n- in Brazil and Argentina, two of our four brands are in the top 3 of their competitive segment;\n- in India and Asia Pacific:\n  - the podium is 100% Stellantis on the mainstream market;\n  - in Japan, two of our three brands are in the top 3 on the premium market;\n- in Europe:\n  - in Italy, three of our brands are in the first quartile of their competitive segment;\n  - in Germany, two of our three brands are in the top 3 on the premium market;\nin the U.S. market, the Initial Quality Study (IQS) measures initial quality by the number of problems experienced per 100 vehicles (PP100) during the first 90 days of ownership with a lower score reflecting higher quality. For 2021, several Stellantis brands, Ram, Dodge and Jeep, received ratings that were above industry average; we also track the three months product repair rate vs reference year (in base 100).\n\nThe quality of Stellantis LEVs has improved for the last two years. From September 2019 to March 2021, the failure rate of our LEVs has decreased by 62%, thus converging to the Internal Combustion Engine vehicles quality level.\n\nLEV 3 Month in Service Failure rate vs Production month\n\nBase 100 is September 2019 Production month\nNo production in April 2020 due to Covid19 confinement period\n\nStellantis also provides the percentage of plants that are certified to widely accepted product quality standards such as ISO 9001. This provides customers an external recognition on our ability to deliver products with a high level of quality.\n\n- 100% of the Stellantis vehicle assembly plants are certified ISO 9001;\n- 100% of the Stellantis powertrain plants are certified ISO 9001 or IATF 16949.\n\nThe actions taken regarding product quality are key in making warranty improvements. Warranty costs per vehicle (CpV) have reduced by 34% since 2015, despite significant headwinds in parts pricing, dealer labor, and dealer mark-up.\n\nStellantis Warranty costs evolution\n\n% vs CY2015 baseline\n\n1 Scope: All Stellantis brands in the Enlarged Europe region (34 electrified models)\nIn addition to meeting the industry\u2019s defined product quality standards, customers expect consistently high quality in the areas of consulting, service and repair with regards to vehicles and spare parts. Service quality is based on the service expectations of the customer and the factual service received by the customer and is a critical factor in retaining customer loyalty. Here are two examples.\n\n**VIDEOCHECK** is a program designed to increase transparency for customers by showing them, with videos and clear explanations, the points that need to be repaired on their vehicles. With this process, Stellantis is demonstrating a high level of transparency and reinforcing customer confidence. Being informed, customers can make decisions on additional repair needs that are proposed. VIDEOCHECK is now used by more than 5,000 repair locations worldwide. 96% of the customers who experienced it have provided feedback that they are very satisfied with this service. This is a major step toward increased customer satisfaction.\n\n**wiADVISOR** is a service write-up and repair-order management solution developed in North America. This solution engages the customer in the service lane and supports the customer service journey end-to-end. Among others, it provides the following features:\n\n- online scheduling;\n- mobile check-in without contact;\n- video inspection;\n- vehicle flagging which are quality alerts based on specific criteria during vehicle write-up;\n- vehicle health check through a connection in the service lane;\n- in-dealer and customer communication;\n- supports global mobile app scheduling and status notifications;\n- active delivery including quality of service delivery checks.\n\nFeedback for service quality is gathered through various channels to monitor performance and support strategic decisions. Both former Groupe PSA and former FCA improved their results over the years.\n\n- Customer satisfaction for aftersales experiences may differ from the responses for new vehicle purchases. Performance across time shows that both measures are improving with larger gains in the aftersales customer responses.\n\n**Recommendation rate in the service quality surveys carried out by former Groupe PSA for new vehicle purchases and after-sales service**\n\nCumulative 12 months - Base 100 2019\nThe Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a customer loyalty metric that measures the willingness of a customer to return for another purchase or service and also make a recommendation to their family, friends or colleagues. It takes into account promoters and detractors.\n\nEvolution of the Net Promoter score in the service quality surveys carried out by FCA for new vehicle purchases and after-sales service NPS\nCumulative 12 months - Base 100 2019\n\nStellantis has chosen Net Promoter Scores (NPS) as the main KPI for quality of service.\n\nAs values are confidential, the 2021 NPS result published in the surveys released in 2022 for Stellantis is considered as base 100.\n\n4.3 VEHICLE SAFETY\n\n4.3.1 CONTEXT AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\nGRI 103-1\n\nCSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE #10: Vehicle safety\n\nVehicle safety is important to all road users including cyclists, pedestrians and other motorists. It is governed by laws and regulations and may also be addressed through voluntary codes of practice, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Governmental agencies and departments such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the U.S., Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) in Japan, Federal Bureau of Motor Vehicles - Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA) in Germany, Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) in the UK, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) in South Korea are also introducing increasingly stringent vehicle safety measures.\n\nStellantis understands that safety is one of the most important expectations in society and impacts customer choices. We integrate such expectations in each phase of the design of our vehicles. We work to anticipate enhanced safety expectations related to connected and autonomous vehicles. In collaboration with our suppliers and partners, we research and develop technology and innovations while analyzing internal test results with a target of continuously improving design.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nAs the vehicle safety and regulatory framework evolves, the Company is committed to the safety of its customers and other road users. Stellantis has taken a lead role in the framework of ISO to address the specificity of data regarding autonomous driving for ISO 21448 and actively participates with recognized organizations in the rulemaking process and implementation of new regulations and standards regarding vehicle safety.\n### 4.3.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\n| CSR ISSUE | VISION / AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | 2021 RESULTS |\n|-----------|-------------------|----------------|------------|--------------|\n| CSR issue #10 Vehicle safety Owners Chief Engineering Officer | Develop and offer safe products all around the world, continuously striving for state-of-the-art level of safety risk avoidance, as well as crash protection for vehicle occupants and vulnerable road users. | Level of robustness of the global harmonized vehicle safety organization, processes and technical expertise, including active safety, passive safety, cybersecurity (for its safety relevance), and product safety | 2025: Governance, organization and processes defined and set up, external audit every 3 years, performed by an independent assessment body and considering industry standards including ISO26262, ISO21448, ISO21434. | The Stellantis Global Safety Forum led by the Global Technical Safety and Regulatory Compliance Executive was formalized and is now a functional governance body for global safety related strategies. |\n4.3.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n4.3.3.1 Risks\n\nStellantis believes that the automotive industry should adopt a systematic approach to ensure that vehicle safety remains a fundamental corporate value that helps to protect drivers, passengers, the environment and our communities in a socially responsible and sustainable manner. Vehicle safety is designed to address the risks that may be encountered and is essential to support the reputation of the Company, its brands and technologies. Anticipating regulation changes and participating in the rule making process and standardization efforts provide opportunities to adapt our vehicles and shape the automotive industry.\n\nVehicle safety is included as part of our culture to increase vehicle quality by empowering employees, contractors, suppliers and dealers to speak up if they have concerns. When risks are addressed, and opportunities to add content that achieve improved safety ratings are deployed, safer vehicles are the result. Safer vehicles can increase customer and stakeholder trust. Stellantis confirms its commitment to vehicle safety and supports an integrated approach including a sound impact assessment to identify the most effective measures.\n\n4.3.3.2 Opportunities\n\nWe leverage innovation to reinforce the safety of our vehicles and services. All aspects of safety; including active, passive, product and cyber are addressed in our processes and Innovations.\n\nStellantis is contributing to the definition of vehicle safety through several channels:\n\n- Strong commitment of safety-related standardization activities (e.g., Functional Safety and Safety of the Intended Functionality, relevant for autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS)).\n\n- Involvement in innovation initiatives and consortiums include:\n  - research activities on \u201cVehicle to X\u201d and 5G technologies, which may help make the vehicles of the future more intelligent and comfortable for users. The autonomous functions may contribute to fewer accidents caused by human error and reduce driver fatigue;\n  - involvement in consortiums in this field include 5G Carmen (cross border tests on service continuity), C-Roads-2 and ICT4CART while on-going;\n    - PSA activities in 5G Croco and 5G Open Road (test in real-life driving conditions of 5G continuity);\n    - FCA activities in SGAA (5G Automotive), IGLAD (Initiative for the Global Harmonization of Accident Data) and TTS (Telematica per i Trasporti e la Sicurezza).\n  - Participation continues in the prior PSA organization on several cooperative projects regarding the safety of autonomous driving such as L3 Pilot (Scenarios database for autonomous driving specification and validation), SETL4LS (autonomous driving validation for Levels 4 and 5 automation), Pegasus VVM (verification and validation methods for automated driving), 3SA project in the SystemX French consortium (methods and tools for safety simulation).\n  - Involved in several working groups of the French Plate-Forme Automobile (PFA) on the safety of automated driving, e.g. for the development of autonomous shuttles.\n  - Commitment to European research projects such as EVADE (assessment of the performance of ADAS like Automated Emergency Braking and Automated Evasive Steering).\n\n4.3.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nStellantis created a unified Global Safety Forum led by the Global Technical Safety and Regulatory Compliance Executive. This forum will guide the Company on the application of future standards and ratify future processes and procedures concerning vehicle safety and security. We are growing our Transversal Safety Expertise Networks to further develop and improve our safety processes and assess their implementation in our vehicles. At a regional level, decision making processes are in place to address potential vehicle safety issues.\n4.3.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nDelivering safe products to our customers is a fundamental objective of Stellantis and is among the essential responsibilities described in our Code of Conduct. We work to achieve compliance with regulatory standards to deliver quality products and services with a high level of safety and reliability. Employees are expected to comply with the implemented safety standards, taking appropriate steps to prevent, identify and correct any non-compliance with such standards. Any vehicle safety issue encountered must be immediately reported to supervisors, the Compliance or Legal Departments or through the whistleblower line.\n\n4.3.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nSafety research\n\nThe Stellantis advanced engineering organizations around the world apply virtual reality methods and innovative technological solutions for virtual and physical tests. The engineers also analyze real world data to develop and assess effective vehicle safety systems, protection for vulnerable road users and integration of active and passive safety systems.\n\nStellantis participates in national and international organizations that are focused on areas of occupant and vulnerable road user safety, such as assisting in the development of new and improved safety standards and automated driving system best practices. We are a member of the Initiative for the Global Harmonization of Accident Data (IGLAD), a consortium of auto manufacturers that collects and analyzes traffic accident data to improve road and vehicle safety and has supported the EU project MeBeSafe. In Europe, the Company is a stakeholder of the LAB, a joint laboratory with Renault, which is working on accident case studies and biomechanics. In the U.S., the Company collaborates with other automakers through groups like the U.S. Council for Automotive Research (USCAR), to identify technical issues and conduct research related to vehicle safety.\n\nProduct development\n\nFor every Stellantis vehicle project, safety experts perform technical assessments throughout the project and those results are summarized and communicated to the Product Development Department\u2019s top management for review and approval to continue. Although a similar process exists in both organizations, an expanded and harmonized process is currently being incorporated and will be utilized on all future Stellantis vehicle projects. The network of appointed safety experts define, apply, monitor and improve safety practices in Stellantis, and contribute to the definition of international standards.\n\nProduct investigation\n\nStellantis has a dedicated team to investigate field issues including those with potential safety consequences. Investigations are launched to determine root causes, potential consequences and corresponding safety risks and countermeasures e.g., field actions and product safety recalls. The investigation team coordinates the response to the identified incidents with the engineering teams, manufacturing, suppliers and customer care. The procedures include opportunities for early detection, crisis management and immediate action. The safety expert network can contribute to this process for the root cause analysis and risk assessment.\n\nCybersecurity\n\nSecuring customer data and our vehicles from cybersecurity threats is a priority for Stellantis. We have a cross-functional team focused on the security of our corporate systems and vehicles by monitoring threats, clearly defining requirements followed by design and implementation reviews, validation and penetration testing of products and services and incident response. Cybersecurity is considered throughout a vehicle\u2019s life cycle including during development, manufacturing, use, service and disposal.\n\nWe are engaged in the development of international industry standards through participation with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and SAE International committees and in the development of best practice guidelines through participation in the Automotive-Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Auto-ISAC). Auto-ISAC enhances the industry\u2019s ability to quickly learn of new threats and vulnerabilities and to work collaboratively on threat intelligence for triage.\nStellantis cybersecurity is underway in its preparation to receive certification of compliance for its Cyber Security Management Systems along with type approvals for vehicles sales and registrations as part of UNECE WP.29 R155 incorporated into GSR v2 2019/2144.\n\n4.3.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nAs explained in our Code of Conduct, our workforce members contribute to achieving compliance with regulatory standards ensuring that the Company delivers quality products and services with a high level of safety, reliability and environmental performance.\n\nVehicle Safety Technology\n\nStellantis responds to consumer expectations of high tech solutions in their vehicles by devoting significant resources to research and develop technologies that support drivers and passengers\u2019 ability to safely interact with their vehicle and with the world around them. By providing real-time availability of services and information, the Company is contributing to improve safety and the mobility experience.\n\nStellantis offers active (primary) and passive (secondary) features for diverse drivers and vehicle segments, along with tertiary safety elements. The intent of active safety systems is to help drivers avoid crashes by alerting them to certain potentially hazardous situations or assisting them in mitigating the risk posed by certain types of identified hazards. These systems monitor surroundings, the status of the vehicle, driver behavior and include semi-automated technologies that provide assistance to drivers in certain instances, with the driver retaining appropriate control. Stellantis is exploring new connected safety notification technologies, multi-access edge computing (MEC) and Safety Cloud, that provide drivers advanced notification warnings of potential hazards in their path.\n\nPassive, or secondary, safety systems are designed to help mitigate the effects of a crash. These include occupant restraint technology and the use of more advanced materials that enable us to improve crash energy management. Vehicles are structurally designed to dissipate an impact in a controlled manner, due to the positioning of shock absorbing structures and other design features, while also promoting vehicle repairability. Deformation of the passenger compartment is minimized. Airbags and restraint systems absorb energy which leads to a reduction of the impact on occupants in crashes.\n\nIn the area of tertiary safety, or post-accident emergency response, Stellantis provides emergency rescue sheets with information to rescue teams or first responders on special design elements and the position of components to be considered when assisting the occupants of vehicles involved in an accident. In addition, since March 2010, the Connect Box developed by former Groupe PSA provides assistance when an accident or health related incident occurs in the vehicle. The occupants are connected with a dedicated assistance center that pinpoints the vehicle. Motorway control centers in Europe are automatically warned of any accidents on their roads via the emergency call service in the Company\u2019s equipped vehicles as this is becoming a legal obligation in Europe.\n\nCOMPANY TRANSFORMATION THROUGH THE SOFTWARE STRATEGY\n\nStellantis mapped out its software strategy to deploy next-generation tech platforms, building on existing connected vehicle capabilities to transform how customers interact with their vehicles. Over-the-air (OTA) updates expand the options customers have to add innovative features and services keeping vehicles updated with the latest offerings years after they have been built, while dramatically reducing costs for both customers and Stellantis.\n\nOwners of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Fiat and Alfa Romeo vehicles will receive a free over-the-air software update called the Emergency Vehicle Alert System or EVAS, which was introduced at the 2022 CES electronics show in Las Vegas. Stellantis is the first automaker to implement its EVAS to 2018-and-newer Stellantis cars, trucks and SUVs. Initially available only in North America, it could be offered eventually in all 14 Stellantis brands worldwide.\n\nThe new system warns drivers of nearby emergency vehicles, making it possible to provide more time to react. OTA alerts are sent from emergency vehicles to nearby drivers as well as other responding emergency vehicles within approximately a half-mile. Real time data is used from emergency vehicles using the HAAS company\u2019s service called Safety Cloud. This gives drivers an additional warning and more time to move over and slow down compared to conventional lights and sirens alone. More information at this link.\nACTIVE SAFETY SYSTEMS\n\nSeek to avoid accidents  Track vehicle environment and performance\n\nEXAMPLES OF ACTIVE SYSTEMS THAT GIVE THE DRIVER MORE CONTROL IN DANGEROUS SITUATIONS\n\n- Anti-lock braking (ABS)\n- Electronic stability control (ESC)\n- Autonomous emergency braking (AEB)\n- Lane departure warning (LDW)\n\nSafety Roadmap\n\nStellantis continuously evolves its vehicles by offering enhanced safety technology and state of the art features that are proven to help reduce crashes and injuries. All Stellantis vehicles are rigorously tested and validated internally before being tested by outside stakeholders such as the U.S. government (NHTSA) or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) or NCAP organizations. In 2021, Stellantis performed more than 400,000 validations, either by physical testing or virtual validation.\n\nTo address the current traffic safety priorities globally, Stellantis vehicles are developed with new technologies such as:\n\n- Lane Keeping Assist: 57% of Stellantis models\n- Automatic Emergency Braking: 63% of Stellantis models\n- Rear seats seatbelts with pretensioner or load limiter: 66% of Stellantis models\n- Speed limiting device: 69% of Stellantis models\n\nStellantis also conducts research and innovation activities in the field of crash and occupant safety. The frontal roof airbag is an example of innovation that offers improved protection to the front passenger occupant in certain crash situations.\n\nProduct Investigations and Recall campaigns\n\nWhen potential vehicle safety issues arise, we promptly investigate and take corrective action as previously stated (refer to 4.3.6). This includes initiating safety recall campaigns when appropriate. Stellantis aims to improve the overall customer experience during the safety recall process through timely and accurate communication and reduced customer inconvenience. In 2021, there were 124 recall campaigns involving 3,003,480 initial recall notices. 6,058,212 Stellantis vehicles were produced worldwide. Programs are in place to raise public awareness regarding the need for customers to regularly check for open recalls and the importance of getting recall repairs completed.\n\nThe three largest recall campaigns by total number of vehicles are:\n\n- Campaign on approximately 1,203,747 vehicles to prevent risk of injury due to potential projectiles during a driver airbag deployment;\n- Campaign on approximately 499,228 vehicles to prevent over tightening of the lug nuts which could result in a broken wheel stud and possible tire separation;\n- Campaign on approximately 267,833 vehicles to replace Takata driver and passenger airbags as part of the global recall campaign.\n\nAll of these campaigns are carried out transparently with respect to:\n\n- the relevant requirements of authorities (regulatory filing of declarations for safety campaigns):\n  - each notification document submitted to the authorities indicates: the models and parts concerned, vehicle manufacture dates, type of risk, description of the defect and corrective measures taken;\n- the automotive brands\u2019 dealership networks:\n  - the traceability of the components purchased during manufacture enables the Company to draw up a list of vehicles that are potentially concerned.\nWhen a campaign is launched an alert including all the information, such as a list of vehicles concerned, content of the message to customers, necessary procedure and parts required is sent to the dealership networks via the appropriate IT systems;\n\n- the owners of the vehicles involved notified individually:\n  - the method used to notify the customer is in line with the local regulations in each country. The affected customers are invited to make an appointment with an authorized brand repair facility to make the necessary adjustments;\n  - the repair facility contacted provides all the necessary information, including the appointment date, how long the repair will take, the confirmation that the repairs are free of charge, the terms for using a replacement vehicle, etc.;\n  - the customer is asked to notify the brand of any change in vehicle status, including its sale, end of life or change of address.\n\nStellantis monitors the implementation of each campaign specifically based on progress indicators and the actual repairs made in each campaign. Repeat requests are sent to customers who do not come forward. The operations carried out are free of charge for the customer.\n\n**Theft Resistance**\n\nStellantis has long been working on making vehicles resistant to theft and protecting vehicles and the objects inside them from malicious individuals. Vehicles are designed to help avoid break-ins referring to standards in line with leading authorities and taking into account current threats.\n\nSince 2011, a unit has been analysing and addressing potential or known vulnerabilities, conducting statistical and Internet monitoring, and analysing theft methods in conjunction with the police. This work has, for example, spurred alterations to the design of door locks to strengthen their resistance to break-ins.\n\nWe work closely with cybersecurity experts and are assisted by specialized firms. For instance, encryption algorithms used to protect vehicle unlocking and starting are continually improved. The latest generation vehicles use encryption that meets the highest standards.\n\nIn 2021, 100% of ex-PSA vehicles are rated \u201cExceed\u201d by Thatcham as part of extended requirements for passenger vehicles. Since 2011, 93.1% of ex-PSA vehicles have been rated \u201cExceed\u201d by Thatcham for passenger vehicles.\n\n**Training**\n\nProduct safety based training materials are captured in two courses; Introduction to U.S. Motor Vehicle Safety and Safety Defect Determination. Due to legislative and regulatory changes the U.S. Motor Vehicle Safety course has been delayed and will be launched for Stellantis employees in April 2022. These web-based courses are open as a reference to all former FCA global employees but they are a mandatory requirement for specific organizations in North America.\n\nFor the Safety Defect Determination course, 100% of the required employees completed the training in 2021.\n\nOur suppliers in North America have access to a web-based training program that helps them understand expectations and supplier-specific requirements of the U.S. Motor Vehicle Safety Act and regulations of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). This training was launched by FCA in 2017 and incorporated feedback from NHTSA. Building upon this work, a collaboration with the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG) and other automakers standardized this training and made it available throughout the automotive industry.\nPREVENTING ETHICS VIOLATIONS BY PROMOTING OUR ETHICAL CULTURE\n\n5.1 ETHICS IN GOVERNANCE AND BUSINESS PRACTICES 179\n5.1.1 Context and Stellantis position 179\n5.1.2 Forward-looking vision and targets 180\n5.1.3 Governance and decision bodies to lead actions 181\n5.1.4 Policies and resources for ethics in our business 185\n5.1.5 Management of risk and opportunities - continuous improvement 189\n5.1.6 Controls and initiatives 190\n\n5.2 RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION 191\n5.2.1 Context and Stellantis position 191\n5.2.2 Forward-looking vision and targets 192\n5.2.3 Identification and management of risks and opportunities 193\n5.2.4 Governance and decision bodies to lead actions 193\n5.2.5 Policies to execute the strategy 194\n5.2.6 Organization and resources 194\n5.2.7 Main initiatives, achievements and results 195\n\n5.3 RESPONSIBLE INFORMATION TO CUSTOMERS 196\n5.3.1 Context and Stellantis position 196\n5.3.2 Forward-looking vision and targets 197\n5.3.3 Identification and management of risks and opportunities 197\n5.3.4 Governance and decision bodies to lead actions 198\n5.3.5 Policies to execute the strategy 198\n5.3.6 Organization and resources 198\n5.3.7 Main initiatives, achievements and results 199\nIntegrity and ethics are integral in our business practices. They are our foundational principles. We understand that acting with integrity it requires vigilance and commitment. Integrity is a source of competitiveness, a foundation of Stellantis\u2019s sustainable growth and the way to build a reputation that our customers, workforce and other stakeholders can trust and rely on. Furthermore, it is through our strong culture of ethics and integrity that we prevent ethics violations.\n\nStellantis works to comply with the increasingly complex national and international regulations and standards focusing on matters such as conflict minerals, balance and integrity of business relationships, consumer protection, and personal data protection rules (OECD Guidelines, ILO conventions, UN Global Compact, GDPR, among others). We implement ethical standards, notably among them our Code of Conduct, the adherence to which is a requirement of our workforce and business partners.\n\nWhile we strive for integrity in everything we do, we understand the special role of integrity in compliance with regulations or standards that promote sustainable development, such as distribution of value, progressive taxation, cash transfers and investment in human capital, and regulation and strategies of development of inclusive growth.\n\n5.1 ETHICS IN GOVERNANCE AND BUSINESS PRACTICES\n\n5.1.1 CONTEXT AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\nCSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE #11: Ethics in governance and business practices\n\nIntegrity and ethics are integral to our culture and business practices. They are our foundational principles, a source of competitiveness, and the basis for our sustainable growth. They help us avoid costly regulatory violations, and build a reputation that our customers, workforce and other stakeholders can rely on.\n\nOur culture is built upon the conviction of doing what is right, under the overarching principles established in the Stellantis Code of Conduct. This approach looks at our internal processes and controls, but also at our compliance with complex national and international regulations and standards that promote transparency.\n## 5.1.2 Forward-Looking Vision and Targets\n\n| CSR ISSUE | VISION / AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | 2021 RESULTS |\n|-----------|-------------------|----------------|------------|--------------|\n| CSR issue #11 Ethics in governance and business practices (including relations with public institutions, balanced governance and distribution of added value) | Promote a culture of transparency and integrity by requiring our workforce to comply with our Code of Conduct, applying appropriate discipline for non-compliance, and requiring our business partners to adopt and apply similar ethical standards and controls. | Number of days to provide a personalized first answer on reported concerns regarding potential violations of the Code of Conduct | Short-term: 2025: Personalized first answer within 1.5 days | 1.9 days |\n| | | | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan): 2030: Personalized first answer within 1.25 days | |\n| | | | Long-term: 2050: Personalized first answer within 1 day | |\n| | World Most Ethical (WME) Company status with Ethisphere | 2025: Obtain recognition by Ethisphere as one of the World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies as part of their WME process | 2030: Maintain WME status by Ethisphere | Satisfactory progress towards objective |\n| | | | 2050: Maintain WME status by Ethisphere | |\n| | Board gender balance (% of female directors) | N.

Key aspects of Stellantis governance bodies, and their members, are described below with more detailed information available on the Company\u2019s website as well as in the Annual Report.\n\n5.1.3.1 The Composition of the Board of Directors\n\nStellantis has a single-tier Board of Directors that includes executive and non-executive directors. The Board of Directors as a whole is responsible for the strategy of the Company. It is the responsibility of the non-executive Directors to oversee the policies carried out by the executive Directors and the general affairs of the Company. Following their appointment, Directors participated in induction sessions designed to provide them with adequate knowledge of the sector in which the Company operates. These sessions were led by management teams and included the following topics:\n\n- auto OEM business overview with a focus on geographic presence, corporate footprint, R&D methodologies and applications;\n- new product development process including solutions to reduce vehicles CO\u2082 emissions, notably through electrification, in line with the climate change challenge;\n- technological challenges, including software developments driving innovation in the industry and customer experience;\n- auto OEM strategy plans, new emerging players and disruptive innovation and business models.\n\nAs part of the process relating to the Board activities, in 2021 the management provided several updates on the topics treated during the induction sessions. Diversity is one of Stellantis\u2019 core values and members of the Board and its committees are selected on the basis of professional and personal qualifications, as well as diversity factors that include age, gender, expertise, work and personal background and nationality. In the next ten years we aim to achieve, with an overriding emphasis on merit, a Board composition with:\n\n- women occupying at least 40% of the seats of the Board;\n- members whose nationality is reasonably consistent with the geographic footprint of Stellantis\u2019s business in such manner that no nationality shall account for more than 60% of the members of the Board of Directors; and\n- one or more members of the Board of Directors will be under 50 years of age on the day of their nomination.\n\n| 55% of the members of the Board are independent | 22% of the members of the Board are women |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| 35-54 Years                                   | 55-64 Years                               |\n| 47%                                           | 31%                                       |\n| 65-75 Years                                   |                                           |\n\nAverage Board membership 2.2\nBoard Member Skills Relating to Economic, Environmental and Social Impacts\n\nGRI 102-27\n\nThe Board comprises diversified profiles in terms of gender, work, personal background and nationality. Members of the Board of Directors are selected on the basis of professional and personal qualifications in a manner designed to ensure sufficiently diverse and complementary skills to enable these members to deliver the Company\u2019s strategy.\n\nThe skills of the members of the Boards relate to either specific operational experiences or performance as responsible for oversight over major challenges at other corporations where the directors also serve as members of the board.\n\nThe skills are summarized in the following matrix:\n\n|                          | Climate Change | Diversity and Human Rights | Risk Management | Cyber security | New Business Model | Industry\u00b9 | Corporate Social Responsibility | Governance | Financial and Accounting | Board memberships |\n|--------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|---------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|------------------|\n| John Elkann              | \u2713              |                             | \u2713               | \u2713              | \u2713                 | \u2713         | \u2713                               | \u2713           | \u2713                        | 3                |\n| Carlos Tavares           | \u2713              | \u2713                           | \u2713               | \u2713              | \u2713                 | \u2713         | \u2713                               | \u2713           | \u2713                        | 1                |\n| Robert Peugeot           | \u2713              |                             | \u2713               | \u2713              | \u2713                 | \u2713         | \u2713                               | \u2713           | \u2713                        | 4                |\n| Henri de Castries        | \u2713              | \u2713                           | \u2713               | \u2713              | \u2713                 | \u2713         | \u2713                               | \u2713           | \u2713                        | 4                |\n| Andrea Agnelli           | \u2713              |                             | \u2713               | \u2713              | \u2713                 | \u2713         | \u2713                               | \u2713           | \u2713                        | 4                |\n| Fiona Clare Cicconi      | \u2713              | \u2713                           | \u2713               | \u2713              | \u2713                 | \u2713         | \u2713                               | \u2713           | \u2713                        | 0\u00b2               |\n| Nicolas Dufourcq         | \u2713              | \u2713                           | \u2713               | \u2713              | \u2713                 | \u2713         | \u2713                               | \u2713           | \u2713                        | 4                |\n| Ann Frances Godbehere    | \u2713              |                             | \u2713               | \u2713              | \u2713                 | \u2713         | \u2713                               | \u2713           | \u2713                        | 1                |\n| Wan Ling Martello        | \u2713              |                             | \u2713               | \u2713              | \u2713                 | \u2713         | \u2713                               | \u2713           | \u2713                        | 3                |\n| Jacques de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry | \u2713              |                             | \u2713               | \u2713              | \u2713                 | \u2713         | \u2713                               | \u2713           | \u2713                        | 0\u00b2               |\n| Kevin Scott              | \u2713              |                             | \u2713               | \u2713              | \u2713                 | \u2713         | \u2713                               | \u2713           | \u2713                        | 0\u00b2               |\n\n\u00b9 Industry: the Automobiles industry is under the Consumer Discretionary sector according to GICS Level 1 sector classification.\n\u00b2 Excluding Stellantis\n5.1.3.2 Compensation of Directors and Executive Managers\n\nRemuneration of the Board of Directors, for both executive and non-executive Directors, is governed by the Remuneration Policy, which was approved at the Stellantis Annual General Meeting held on April 15, 2021. It takes into account scenario analyses as well as the pay differentials within the Company, compensation levels offered in the market, and shareholder and general societal views on compensation.\n\nThe Company follows a pay for performance compensation philosophy at all levels in the organization ensuring that the compensation strategy is competitive and is structured to attract and retain key staff of the requisite quality.\n\nThe principles and rules decided on by the Board of Directors to determine the compensation and benefits granted to executive directors take into account principles of completeness, balance, consistency and measurement.\n\nThe Company periodically benchmarks its executive compensation program and the compensation offered to Directors against peer companies and monitors compensation levels and trends in the market as well as international standards regarding appropriate remuneration. For this reason, non-financial performance indicators are taken into account when formulating the Company\u2019s compensation structure.\n\nThe design of our compensation program ensures that a significant portion of each executive\u2019s overall compensation is based on the achievement of long-term performance objectives through the Company\u2019s long-term incentive plan, in the belief that placing significantly more weight on the long-term component is appropriate to align the Directors\u2019 and corporate officers\u2019 efforts with the Company\u2019s strategy, long-term interests and sustainability.\n\nThe Board of Directors is assisted by its Remuneration Committee in reviewing and approving corporate goals and annual and long-term performance objectives relative to incentive compensation of executive directors, including other members of the top management team and eligible personnel.\n\nIn 2021, we considered, among others things, CO\u2082 emissions regulatory compliance and quality (product and service) for our short-term incentive program and Electric Vehicle (EV) production and CO\u2082 emissions regulatory compliance for our long-term incentive plan.\n\n### Compensation Criteria and Conditions\n\n| COMPENSATION PROGRAM CSR TOPICS | CSR TOPICS | % |\n|---------------------------------|------------|---|\n| **CEO**                        |            |   |\n| Variable pay                   | CO\u2082 emissions in Europe/global | Pay out trigger |\n|                                 | Product/service quality | 20% |\n| Long term incentive            | CO\u2082 emissions in Europe/global | 20% |\n|                                 | CO\u2082 emissions in Europe/global | Pay out trigger |\n| **Executive Vice Presidents**  |            |   |\n| Variable pay                   | Other individual goals are determined by the CEO which may include both financial and non-financial measures | Determined by the CEO |\n|                                 | Product/service quality | 16% |\n| Long term incentive            | CO\u2082 emissions in Europe/global | 20% |\n\nOther employees eligible for the incentive plans shown in the above table may receive incentive compensation based on the same CSR performance metrics but with different weighting. Individual goals may also include financial and/or nonfinancial performance measures.\n5.1.3.3 Committees supporting governance of Stellantis\n\nThe ESG Committee of the Board of Directors\n\nThe ESG Committee reviews the Company\u2019s CSR roadmap, achievements and disclosures. In 2021 the Governance and Sustainability Committee reviewed its Charter to better address his role and proposed to the Board of Directors the change of name from Governance and Sustainability Committee to ESG Committee together with adoption of the revised Charter. In accordance with the related Charter, the ESG Committee will periodically assess the performance of individual directors and report on this to the Board of Directors.\n\nIn 2021, the Board of Directors itself focused on the assessment of the performance of the Board of Directors, its committees and the individual Directors. It also reviewed the Company\u2019s CSR roadmap and disclosures.\n\nThe Stellantis Annual Report provides details of the membership, skills and work of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and its committees, together with information on the skills of each of their members, as of December 31, 2021. The Board met 6 times during 2021. The average attendance at the Board meetings as well as the Committee meetings was 100 percent.\n\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Stellantis Audit Committee is charged with assisting and advising the Board of Directors with respect to the implementation and effectiveness of the Company\u2019s ethics and compliance program, among other things. In so doing, the Audit Committee oversees and monitors the quality and integrity of the Company\u2019s compliance policies and practices with respect to applicable legal and regulatory requirements, as well as with the requirements and objectives of the Company\u2019s Code of Conduct. The Audit Committee meets with the Company\u2019s management, including finance staff, audit and compliance staff, and legal staff to discuss, among other things, any significant legal, regulatory, Code of Conduct or other compliance related matters that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial statements or operations.\n\nAs stated in the related Charter, the function of the Audit Committee shall be to assist and advise the Board of Directors and act under authority delegated by the Board of Directors, with respect to among others the Company\u2019s policy on tax planning adopted by management.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors is assisted by its Remuneration Committee in reviewing and approving corporate goals and annual and long-term performance objectives relative to incentive compensation of executive directors, including other members of the top management team and eligible personnel.\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance Committee\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance Committee oversees all of Stellantis\u2019s ethics and compliance policies and initiatives, sets targets, reports to the CEO and periodically reports to the Board of Directors through the Audit Committee. The Ethics and Compliance Committee is chaired by the Chief Human Resources and Transformation Officer. The other members include the General Counsel, the Chief Audit and Compliance Officer, and the Chief Legal Officer. The Ethics and Compliance Committee met four times in 2021.\n\nThe Committee is responsible for determining the general direction of the Company\u2019s ethics and compliance policies, based on external factors (new risks, emerging stakeholder expectations, benchmarking and new legislation) as well as internal considerations (risks identified by the integrated risk assessment that considers data from executive interviews, as well as data from reported cases in the whistleblower channel). The Committee is also responsible for developing tools necessary to implement the ethics and compliance policies. The Committee also reviews whistleblower cases and elevates to the Audit Committee cases of potential significant financial impact, reputational damage, or other cases that are strategic according to elevation criteria set forth in the charter of the Ethics and Compliance Committee.\nThe Technical Compliance Committee\n\nThe Technical Compliance Committee oversees the Technical Safety and Regulatory Compliance organization\u2019s compliance with laws and regulations relating to vehicle and product safety, emissions, and other issues of a technical nature that involve regulatory compliance. The delivery of high quality and safe products is one of our overarching objectives, and integrity drives our detection, investigation and remediation of any issue of a technical nature that may jeopardize the safety of our customers, the quality of our products, or our compliance with regulatory requirements, including but not limited to emissions regulations. In addition to technical controls, we employ our whistleblowing channel to gather information about suspected noncompliance and review specific cases within our Technical Compliance Committee, and our Always with Integrity communication campaign focuses in significant part on the importance of reporting any safety and emissions concerns.\n\nLeadership Team\n\nThe general authority to represent the Company is vested in the Board of Directors and the CEO acting individually. On certain key business matters, the CEO is supported by the key governance committees, in particular the Strategy Council, Business Review and Global Programme and Allocation Committees. These bodies are responsible for executing the decisions of the CEO and for providing support for the day-to-day management of the Company. The CEO and members of key governance committees are expected to have exemplary conduct that is consistent with the Code of Conduct, and from time to time lead communications campaigns that help promote the Company\u2019s culture of integrity.\n\n5.1.4 POLICIES AND RESOURCES FOR ETHICS IN OUR BUSINESS\n\n5.1.4.1 Reference guides\n\nThe culture of integrity that begins with our governance bodies is based on core values that traverse the Company across all levels and functions.\n\nCode of Conduct\n\nOur core values are set forth in the Stellantis Code of Conduct. The Stellantis Code of Conduct was approved by the Board of Directors of Stellantis N.V. in March 2021. It applies to the members of the Stellantis Board of Directors, Stellantis\u2019s officers, full-time and part-time employees, temporary and contract workers. Stellantis also expects its stakeholders, including suppliers, dealers, distributors, and joint venture partners, to act with integrity and in accordance with the Code. It is the responsibility of all workforce members to report suspected or potential violations of the Code of Conduct.\n\nThe Stellantis Code of Conduct focuses on four main areas:\n\n- the protection of the Stellantis workforce, including a commitment to diversity, fairness, and health and safety, and to the United Nations declaration on human rights and the International Labour Organization\u2019s declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work;\n- the way that Stellantis conducts business, engaging in sustainable practices that promote vehicle safety, quality, data privacy and environmental protection, and that comply with other applicable laws and regulations, such as anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, insider trading and others;\n- the interaction of Stellantis\u2019s workforce with external parties, including the avoidance of conflicts of interest and the support of our communities; and\n- the protection of Stellantis\u2019s assets and information.\n\nThe Stellantis Code of Conduct is available under the Governance section on the Company\u2019s website.\nPolicies\n\nStellantis policies provide further details and guidance regarding the principles established in the Code of Conduct. These include policies on Anti-corruption, Export Controls, Conflicts of Interest, Data Privacy and others. The policies are tailored to the business of the Company, and emphasize integrity, transparency, compliance with applicable legal or regulatory frameworks, and establish a foundation for sustainability.\n\nFor example, the Tax Policy is premised on compliance with the law and applicable fiscal obligations, a proactive and respectful engagement with tax authorities, and the maximization of legally permissible tax efficiencies. The Policy directs the payment of taxes within the course of its industrial or commercial activities, without shifting value to low-tax jurisdictions. The Company is not present in countries considered as non-compliant according to the OECD tax transparency report.\n\nThe policies are designed, approved and managed by the appropriate functional departments, with oversight by appropriate bodies. For example, as mentioned elsewhere, the Code of Conduct was approved by Board of Directors, and the Ethics and Compliance policies are approved by the Ethics and Compliance Committee, under the oversight of the Audit Committee. Another example is the Tax Policy, which was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, as part of the overall tax and financial strategy approved by the Audit Committee of Board of Directors, and is implemented under the direction of the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nStellantis has deployed a variety of resources to implement its Code and other policies, as further detailed below.\n\nCommunication \u2013 Tone at the Top\n\nThe communication of our core values to all the organization starts with our CEO, who said, in his introduction to the Code, the following:\n\n\u201cAs we begin our journey as a new Company, I want to highlight the importance of two fundamental words that will bring our Group to the heights of respectability and performance: diversity and integrity. We, as Stellantis workforce members, are coming from various countries with different cultures and professional backgrounds. This is our personal pride and our common strength. Our commitment towards a diverse and inclusive workplace ensures that we value everyone\u2019s contribution to the success of Stellantis, which notion is embedded in its name. With integrity, we ensure compliance with the laws, regulations and best practices that help us offer safe and high-quality vehicles and services to our customers. Integrity is a source of competitiveness, a foundation of our sustainable growth and the way to build day after day our reputation as a Company that our customers, workforce and stakeholders can trust and rely on.\u201d\n\nCarlos Tavares\nChief Executive Officer\n\nCommunication \u2013 Tone at the Middle\n\nIn addition to the CEO, senior and middle managers are entrusted with cascading messages regarding the Company\u2019s ethics and values. In 2021, senior management distributed short video messages on ethics topics in a series entitled \u201cAlways with Integrity.\u201d Middle managers are encouraged to disseminate messages about ethics in meetings and gatherings. The Company also embeds \u201cCompliance Champions\u201d in every region and in specific functional areas with the intention of ensuring that all operations have solid ethics and compliance resources at their disposal.\nTraining\n\nTo reinforce ethics and compliance communications, the Ethics and Compliance Committee oversees a multi-year training plan. In 2021, the Company produced and released an online training on the Code of Conduct. The training is designed to be user-friendly and viewable on mobile devices. Close to the end of 2021, 77,285 people had individually completed the Code of Conduct online training and confirmed their acknowledgment of the Code of Conduct, comprising 88% of targeted employees.\n\nThe Company also began a release of anti-corruption training in 2021. 11,667 employees had completed this course close to the end of 2021, representing 60% of the target population, and more will continue to complete the course in early 2022. The Company will also release other ethics-related courses in 2022.\n\n| Areas                        | Number of hours | Target number of employees | % of employees trained vs target |\n|------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Code of Conduct              | 51,221          | 87,612                     | 88%                             |\n| Anti-corruption (partial completion) | 7,700          | 19,370                     | 60%                             |\n\nReporting Concerns - Integrity Helpline\n\nIn 2021, Stellantis merged the former PSA and FCA whistleblower systems into one single, robust system. The new Stellantis whistleblower channel is designed to ensure that any suspected violations of our Code of Conduct can be reported, received, and resolved properly and efficiently. Our \u201cAlways with Integrity\u201d campaign highlights the availability of the reporting system for all types of concerns, including vehicle safety and regulatory concerns. This system is open to workforce members, business partners and other stakeholders and is accessible on Stellantis\u2019 website.\n\nThrough our internal controls and the use of specialized, independent service providers, the Company\u2019s whistleblower channel is designed to protect the confidentiality of persons who make a report. Reports may be made anonymously unless local law provides otherwise.\n\nReports are investigated as appropriate by trained investigators and subject matter experts, and are tracked until their completion. We apply corrective actions to confirmed violations of the Code.\n\nIn addition to the whistleblower channel, workforce members have the ability to raise questions about the Code or reports of potential violations to their direct supervisors and the Human Resources, Compliance, and Legal Departments.\n\nAt Stellantis, we do not allow any retaliation against any person who makes a report in good faith or who cooperates in an investigation. Interested parties are allowed to report a concern confidentially and anonymously where allowed by law. Any retaliation is subject to disciplinary action.\n5.1.4.2 Resources to Ensure Responsible Public Affairs Practices\n\nStellantis closely monitors its relationships with public authorities with the intention of ensuring that the Company interacts with government officials in a transparent, responsible and ethical way. In Europe, for example, the Company allocated a budget of approximately \u20ac1.7 million to its public affairs activities in 2021. The Company follows the guidelines issued by the European Commission and European Parliament for reporting on Stellantis\u2019s European activities. Accordingly, this amount includes:\n\n- personnel costs based on a full-time equivalent (50% of the total personnel costs);\n- the office and administrative expenses (100% of the costs, except for mobility costs covered at 50%);\n- the costs related to professional associations (25%);\n- externalization costs (100%).\n\nIn the United States, federal lobbying is regulated by the U.S. Congress. Stellantis files quarterly lobbying reports that disclose spending on lobbying activities and the specific topics that its registered federal lobbyists addressed in interactions with particular public officials. The amount spent on lobbying that is reported for 2021 is \u20ac3.4 million, which includes:\n\n- labor costs (including G&A costs) for hours spent lobbying (100%);\n- amount paid to trade associations that the trade associations use for lobbying (100%);\n- amount paid to third party lobbying firms (100%); and\n- travel, meals, and other expenses incurred while lobbying (100%).\n\nThe chart below details Stellantis\u2019s consolidated contributions for lobbying activities in 2021:\n\n| (in \u20ac million)                  | 2021 contribution |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Internal                        | 2.9\u20ac              |\n| Trade Associations and Consultancy | 2.2\u20ac             |\n| Political contributions         | -                 |\n| **Total contribution**          | **5.1\u20ac**          |\n\n5.1.4.3 The Company\u2019s Tax Policy\n\nThe Company\u2019s Tax Policy (the \u201cTax Policy\u201d) is approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and is published on the Company\u2019s website. The Tax Policy and supporting Policies have been adopted to ensure that Tax Compliance, Tax Planning and Tax Risks are effectively and consistently managed at the Regional, Sector and Group levels. The Tax Policy is guided by the primary consideration that all material tax positions taken by the Company must comply with applicable laws and regulations and with the core principles that define the Company\u2019s relationships with its main stakeholders and govern how it conducts its business activities.\n\nThe Company\u2019s fiscal policy is to pay taxes legally due in countries within the course of its industrial or commercial activities, without shifting value to low-tax jurisdictions. Under the same policy, cross-border transactions are conducted on an arms-length basis in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, including OECD Guidelines where applicable. Secrecy jurisdictions or so-called \u2018tax havens\u2019 are not to be used for the avoidance of tax.\n\nThe Company\u2019s annual tax disclosures are included within the financial statements and accompanying footnotes available on the Company\u2019s website.\n5.1.5 MANAGEMENT OF RISK AND OPPORTUNITIES - CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT\n\nThe Chief Audit and Compliance Officer periodically conducts a Compliance Assessment to ensure that the Ethics and Compliance Program identifies compliance risks, takes proper steps to mitigate such risks, and does so in an efficient manner. The identification of compliance risks includes communication and collaboration with the ERM and Audit functions, as well as the integration of information from various relevant sources, including the Integrity Helpline channel. Mitigation steps include training, communication, third party management, and disciplinary enforcement for violations of the Code. Every functional element of the program is subject to analysis for continuous improvement, benchmarking, and audit. Opportunities for improvement are compiled and periodically reviewed by the Ethics and Compliance Committee.\n\nIn line with directives from the Ethics and Compliance Committee, and with the principle that an ethics violation in these areas could be materially adverse to the Company, the Chief Audit and Compliance Officer devotes special focus to the following areas of the law:\n\n- **Competition**: we believe in robust and fair competition in the marketplace, and strongly support the benefits it provides to our customers. Competition also promotes innovation. We strictly follow the competition laws that apply to our business all over the world.\n\n- **Responsible relationships with our external stakeholders**: we understand that the success of our business depends on our ability to interact effectively with governments, customers, suppliers, and civil society at large. Based on the experiences of its predecessor entities, Stellantis works diligently to increase transparency in all dealings with its all stakeholders, including unionized labor, suppliers, business partners and NGOs.\n\n- **Export Controls**: our specialists around the world classify our products with an intention to ensure compliance with regulations that restrict trade in furtherance of national security objectives. Our team also ensures that we are in compliance with economic sanctions that restrict or prohibit trade in certain countries or with designated companies or individuals.\n\n- **Lobbying and Public Affairs**: our relationship with governments is respectful, proactive and transparent. We monitor applicable legislation and regulations, and we bring our expertise to the development of regulations and standards that are responsive to the needs of our customers, communities and other stakeholders. The Public Affairs Department is dedicated and trained to ensure an efficient and fair working relationship with governments, in full compliance with the law. It also oversees the enforcement of Stellantis\u2019s policy that no Company funds or assets may be used for contributions to any political party or candidate. The regional heads of the Public Affairs Departments report to the General Counsel and to the appropriate country or regional Chief Operating Officers.\n\n- **Data Protection**: Stellantis considers the personal rights and privacy of each individual to be fundamental and intends to protect them. Stellantis works to comply with privacy requirements by applying to Company processes the principles relating to the processing of personal data such as lawfulness, correctness, transparency, data minimization, conservation and purpose limitation, integrity and confidentiality.\n\n- **Anti-Corruption**: corruption has a corrosive and detrimental impact on society, and Stellantis is committed to taking affirmative steps to prevent it in its business, which include training and know-your-partner due diligence controls. Multiple anti-corruption laws with territorial and extraterritorial application apply to Stellantis, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, France Sapin II, and the United Kingdom Bribery Act.\n\n- **Tax**: the Company believes that taxes are key contributors to the economic and social development of the communities in which we operate and play a vital role in creating long-term value. We are committed to fulfilling our fiscal obligations by administering and paying all required taxes. We support the alignment of tax approaches within the regions in order to ensure fair competition. We work to maintain an open, honest, transparent relationship in all dealings with tax authorities. We do not use \u201ctax haven\u201d jurisdictions for the avoidance of tax.\n\n- **Fair Trade**: with operations spanning more than 130 countries, Stellantis supports the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled-based system and encourages international trade deals. Trade agreements foster innovation, growth and wider customer choices at lower prices. The Company favors the elimination of tariffs, as well as a greater convergence towards international standards and trade facilitation, to provide better market access by reducing technical barriers and customs procedures in both a proportional and coordinated manner.\nWhere appropriate, our compliance processes are not limited to complying with the law. For example, in addition to compliance with regulations regarding integrity in business relationships, consumer protection, and personal data protection rules (GDPR), we consider other types of guidance such as OECD Guidelines, ILO conventions, UN Global Compact, and the International Monetary Fund\u2019s initiatives for distribution of value, progressive taxation, investment in human capital, and development of inclusive growth. Stellantis is a member of professional and industrial associations in its main host countries and regions. These associations enable updates to regulations to be monitored and public authorities\u2019 requests regarding the development of the automotive industry to be addressed, focusing on a sectoral approach.\n\nThe main organizations of which Stellantis is participates in are:\n\n- in Europe, the ACEA \u2013 European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association;\n- in France, the CCFA \u2013 Comit\u00e9 des constructeurs fran\u00e7ais d\u2019automobiles (French automotive industry committee), the Plateforme Fran\u00e7aise Automobile \u2013 Automotive and Mobility sector;\n- in Germany, the VDA \u2013 Verband der Automobilindustrie;\n- in Spain, the ANFAC \u2013 Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Fabricantes de Autom\u00f3viles y Camiones (Spanish national association of car and truck manufacturers);\n- in the UK, the SMMT Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders;\n- in the U.S., the Alliance for Automotive Innovation;\n- in Canada, the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers\u2019 Association;\n- in Mexico, the Asociaci\u00f3n Mexicana de la Industria Automotriz A.C.;\n- in Brazil, the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional dos Fabricantes de Ve\u00edculos Automotores (ANFAVEA);\n- in China, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM).\n\n5.1.6 CONTROLS AND INITIATIVES\n\nThe Internal Audit and Compliance Department includes regulatory compliance and the ethics and compliance program within the scope of its annual audit plan. Pursuant to the department\u2019s procedures for the selections of topics for internal audits, the department may choose to review adherence to policies dealing with competition, anti-corruption, data privacy, export controls, and other compliance-related topics.\n\nAt appropriate times, the Company selects external parties to conduct audits of specific functions. External Audits performed by independent auditors include topics such as Integrity Helpline, emissions-related regulatory compliance, environmental health and safety, and energy management systems. The Integrity Helpline and compliance with emissions regulations as well as applicable agreements with certain governing agencies are audited by those governmental agencies, while environmental health and safety, and energy management systems are audited by an accredited ISO Certification bodies.\n\nAs mentioned above in section 5.1.5, the Company also conducts a Compliance Assessment to ensure that the Ethics and Compliance Program identifies compliance risks, takes proper steps to mitigate such risks, and does so in an efficient manner. This process includes information from various internal sources, but also incorporates benchmarking from organizations devoted to corporate ethics, such as Ethisphere.\n5.2 RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION\n\n5.2.1 CONTEXT AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\nGRI 103-1\n\nCSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE #12: Responsible management of personal information\n\nGiven today\u2019s ever-expanding connectivity and digitalization of activities, a lot of personal information are processed in the everyday\u2019s life of people, e.g. online services, online shopping, social media, Internet of Things (IoT). Internet users who are not well-versed in the legal issues surrounding the privacy of information are becoming increasingly wary. This leads more and more regulators all over the world to define privacy regulations in order to protect fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons concerning their personal information. The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which entered into force on May 25, 2018, is one of the first and most complete regulation, but other countries define their own local regulation (e.g. California Consumer Privacy Act, LGPD Brazilian data protection law).\n\nThe challenges for companies consist of implementing all due processes fulfilling these regulations, especially by providing customers\u2019 clear and transparent information. Stellantis aims to maintain a relationship founded on trust by working to ensure that personal data is kept confidential and only processed for valid purposes. Because the trust of our customers, employees and other concerned data subjects is fundamental, we take actions to adhere to data protection rules.\n\nFor Stellantis, the collection and processing of personal data is essential to bring customers the benefits from innovative services and products, these processes are intended to ensure full compliance with data privacy regulations.\n\nThe Company is committed to the legitimate protection of consumer information and striving to ensure safety and security of data. These activities also support the Company\u2019s performance.\n\nCOMPANY TRANSFORMATION THROUGH THE SOFTWARE STRATEGY\n\nOn Software Day December 7, 2021, Stellantis mapped out its software strategy to deploy next-generation tech platforms, building on existing connected vehicle capabilities to transform how customers interact with their vehicles.\n\nThis transformation will move Stellantis\u2019 vehicles from today\u2019s dedicated electronic architectures to an open software-defined platform that seamlessly integrates with customers\u2019 digital lives. This platform is designed to greatly expand the options offered to customers who can add, with their consent, innovative features and services via regular over-the-air (OTA) updates keeping vehicles fresh, exciting and updated years after they have been built.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nWe commit to protecting customers\u2019 and employees\u2019 personal data, and more globally personal data of all categories of data subjects. Mostly based on the European data protection regulation GDPR and of corresponding regulation in other jurisdictions, we respect the privacy requirements of customers\u2019 personal data for both current customers that use products and services, and prospective customers where data is obtained via Stellantis websites, apps, in the network or in-vehicle systems.\n\nWe work to ensure that they are used appropriately while maintaining the principles relating to processing personal data such as lawfulness, fairness, transparency, data minimization, storage and purpose limitation, integrity and confidentiality.\n\nWe implement processes to respect customers\u2019 preferred contact methods to ensure that each customer has control over his personal data shared with our Company.\n\n1GDPR General Data Protection Regulation official text\nThe protection of personal data is considered a fundamental right for customers and it is an important factor of confidence and loyalty contributing towards satisfaction. The Company through its participation in the discussions led by local and European bodies such as CCFA (Comit\u00e9 des Constructeurs Automobiles Fran\u00e7ais), VDA (Verband der Automobilindustrie), ASSONIME and Unione Industriale Association (Italy), ACEA (European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association), works with the European authorities to shape how the GDPR is applied to car manufacturers\u2019 activities as well as to share a common understanding of privacy regulations related to new technologies applied to connected vehicles.\n\n5.2.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\n| CSR ISSUE | VISION / AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | 2021 RESULTS |\n|-----------|-------------------|----------------|------------|--------------|\n| CSR issue #12 | Protect personal data by processing information confidentially and according to applicable data protection regulations | % of complaints raised by Supervisory Authorities from customer privacy/data protection infringements handled within 1 month (and/or due date required by the Authorities) | Short-term: 2022: 100% | 100% |\n| Owner | General Counsel | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan): 2030: 100% | Long-term: 2040: 100% | |\n5.2.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nPrivacy being now considered and understood as part of the fundamental rights and freedoms of persons, protection of personal data by Stellantis is taken into account at the earliest stage possible in our activities to avoid risks for data subjects and risks for the Company in terms of compliance with privacy regulations, reputation and operational efficiency.\n\nOf course, our first priority is to avoid risks for data subjects themselves when we process personal information of our customers, employees and other concerned data subjects.\n\n5.2.3.1 Risks\n\nThe Company is managing three main categories of risks in this area:\n\n- Non-compliance with existing and future regulations, that may lead to fines (e.g. up to 4% of annual turnover for European GDPR): Risks of non-compliance are mainly addressed by the privacy governance within the Company (see section 5.2.4 for more details), but are also addressed through the training on privacy topics of our employees and by the management of our suppliers and partners with regards to privacy topics.\n\n- Reputational risks, that may lead to a deterioration of our image and impact on sales: Risks of reputation are addressed by providing transparent and clear information to data subjects (e.g. customers, employees) and by providing them with easy access to their personal information (see section 5.2.7, for more information).\n\n- Risks related to operational efficiency, that may lead to redevelop existing non-compliant products and service: Risks due to inefficient internal processes, in terms of personal data protection, may concern various activities of the Company, such as:\n  - Development of our products or services: the risks to develop non-compliant product or services (e.g. vehicles or other means of mobility\u2019s development and more generally all necessary IT development we need for our activity) with regards to privacy regulations are addressed by a strong deployment of our \u201cPrivacy by Design\u201d methodologies, aims to include the privacy requirements to enable products and services to fulfil privacy regulations in internal projects methods.\n  - Risks related to security vulnerabilities that could generate cyber-attacks or data breaches: they are addressed to handle them by operational procedures and by the global IT and cybersecurity monitoring of the Company.\n\n5.2.3.2 Opportunities\n\nThe Company\u2019s expertise in addressing and mitigating these risks opens opportunities:\n\n- Implementing \u201cPrivacy by Design\u201d methods and having cybersecurity standards helps the Company to develop and to commercialize new products and services in a responsible way.\n\n- Working to being recognized as a Company that takes care of personal information of its customers and employees allows to maintain the confidence in our Company of our customers and partners for our products and services. This may notably support:\n  - Our business development by increasing the number and the quality of the marketing leads;\n  - The improvement of our products and services and to develop new ones thanks to the data and feedbacks our customers accept to give us.\n\n5.2.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nStellantis has three main areas/privacy organizations related to the legal entities which formed the respective former groups (FCA and Groupe PSA) to coordinate worldwide data protection issues in order to be able to represent Stellantis for the French, German and Italian Supervisory Authorities and to manage efficiently issues on these markets.\n\nAs part of the global ethics and compliance program, the Stellantis N.V. Data Protection Officer (the \u201cDPO\u201d) is the General Counsel of Stellantis, along with the DPOs of the former organizations who have the necessary leadership, operational and strategic skills to understand and face all related risks with strong oversight. The Company\u2019s DPOs are responsible to monitor and promote the data privacy compliance, as well as to define and provide guidance to the organization on requirements of relevant data privacy regulations.\nData protection officers are in charge of monitoring compliance with the rules of personal data protection; informing, advising and issuing recommendations; establishing the respective data protection culture; and cooperating with the respective responsible Supervisory Authorities on issues related to the processing of personal data. Two networks of in-house representatives back up the Company\u2019s DPOs:\n\n- for business divisions: the compliance champions (see 5.1.4.1);\n- for European National Sales Companies: the privacy champions. In addition, several managers within Stellantis ensure integration by design for the protection of personal data and compliance when processing the affected activities, even when working with external subcontractors or services. Each employee is involved in respecting the Company\u2019s data protection policies.\n\nIn 2022, the Company will provide an updated governance.\n\n5.2.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nStellantis is merging its former data protection policies to set up the proper governance and control structures, methods and procedures, regarding the protection of personal data:\n\n- by giving transparent information to customers, employees and other data subject;\n- by improving the efficiency of consent management;\n- by helping data subjects to exercise their rights regarding their personal data;\n- by implementing \u201cPrivacy by Design/by Default\u201d principles during projects;\n- by improving the security of our data storage and networks;\n- by monitoring potential security breaches and applying data breaches procedures;\n- by ensuring the same level of data protection from our subcontractors;\n- by raising awareness or training the managers and the employees;\n- by monitoring and periodically auditing the organization;\n- by maintaining close and confident relationships with Data Protection Authorities.\n\n5.2.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nIn order to ensure the implementation of data privacy policies along with decisions taken by the Company, notably we have set up the following organization to respect the essential principles of \u201cprivacy by design\u201d and \u201cprivacy by default\u201d:\n\n- consistently improving the security of its data storage and exchange by the IT department;\n- working to adapt developments methods for IT, Sales and Marketing, Mobility services, and for Engineering;\n- providing privacy trainings for project managers, engineering teams (to comply with the \u201cprivacy by design\u201d principle for vehicles and connected services) and frontlines (e.g. vendors in the dealership);\n- all the employees in charge for processing the Data received the necessary operational instructions;\n- operating a strong information system security policy;\n- monitoring of system performance or service disruptions: the digitization of a large part of our relationship with our customers, notably now including online sales and payments makes it crucial that access to network, IT systems and data is assured at all times;\n- contingency plans, to ensure business continuity in case of technical failure, human error, malicious attacks, weather events, natural disasters or terrorist attacks.\n\nIn addition, every department and concerned legal entity shall keep updated its legally required records of processing activities by communicating any changes occurred to the Company\u2019s DPOs. The Internal Audit regular audits the organization. Periodically, privacy self-assessments are conducted on the business entities to improve the awareness of managers and to measure the level of GDPR maturity. Based on the findings of Internal Audits, the results and verbatim of the annual self-assessment, and the achievement of improvement action plans, Stellantis DPOs can identify the needs in further enhancements for the internal privacy training, templates of privacy notices, templates of privacy agreements in contracts (Data Processing Agreement).\nThe Company participates actively in discussions led by the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association (ACEA) and by local and European bodies such as CCFA (Comit\u00e9 des Constructeurs Automobiles Fran\u00e7ais), VDA (Verband der Automobilindustrie), ASSONIME and Unione Industriale Association (Italy), sharing best practices to comply with privacy regulations relating to new technologies applied to the automotive sector, in particular with the increasing relevance of connected vehicles.\n\n5.2.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nIn order to provide transparent information to customers, periodic update of all privacy statements were carried out along with the consistent improvement of information provided to customers about the processing of their personal data in the vehicle.\n\nMoreover, the Company has implemented \u2013 and continues to implement \u2013 several measures, such as:\n\n- in early 2021, the roll-out of a new version of the \u201cCookie banner\u201d that aims to be easily understandable and customizable on Company\u2019s websites;\n- implementation of two customer central privacy organizations dedicated to the automotive brands to answer to the questions and requests of our customers, to respond to the right of access, the right to be forgotten etc., helping consumers to exercise their rights regarding their personal data.\n\nAimed at improving the efficiency of consent management, during the year, the Company checked privacy statements to detect non-compliant consent issues, also leveraging on the design and implementation of a central tool for consent management.\n\nTo ensure the same level of Stellantis data protection from the Company\u2019s business partners, a template of the GDPR addendum to supplier contracts \u201cData Processing Agreement\u201d has been defined based on the templates provided by European Union, and our buyers are expected to be trained on using these documents.\n\nFurther periodic meetings were held with the CCFA according to the approach of the French Data Protection Commission (CNIL), which governs contact with the professional associations, as well as in Germany and Italy directly with the local Supervisory Authorities.\n\nReferring to the relation with the French Data Protection Commission (CNIL), the Company was involved in an active process leading the CNIL publication of a \u201cconformity package for connected vehicles\u201d, which explains how privacy regulations apply to the vehicle and connected services to be raised at European level. The CNIL publication has been published early 2021 after having been discussed at ACEA level in 2020, especially with the participation of Stellantis. In 2021, the Company continues also to actively participate in discussions led by ACEA.\n\nInfringement of consumer privacy regulations\n\nAs referred to in paragraph \u201cRisk Management\u201d of form 20-F Report, the Company is subject to governmental investigations and legal proceeding on privacy. The Group in the 2021 has not received any final judgment and sanctions.\n\nWith the aim to monitor the data management processes, Stellantis examines the following indicators that could represent a warning on the privacy compliance:\n\n| INCIDENTS AND BREACHES | 2021 |\n|------------------------|------|\n| DATA BREACHES          | All data breaches are managed under policies implemented in and promptly managed engaging all the main stakeholders in time and addressing the necessary countermeasures. The activity is performed in strict coordination with the Information and Technology Dept., Cyber Security Dept. and our legal team. |\n| CUSTOMERS CLAIMS       | All the Stellantis Companies/Data Controllers, if requested by the local regulations, provide in the privacy notice the contact details to exercise the data subject rights. The DPO teams are constantly involved in the process to manage the data subject requests. |\n| AUTHORITY REQUESTS AND INSPECTION RESULTS | All the Authority requests are promptly managed with the support of the DPO teams. In 2021 the Company did not received any prescriptions and fine. |\n\n1 GDPR and local data protection regulation, European scope\n5.3 RESPONSIBLE INFORMATION TO CUSTOMERS\n\n5.3.1 CONTEXT AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\nCSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE #13: Responsible information to customers\n\nStellantis works to provide responsible information to the customer and to align its marketing practices with sustainability guidelines. The Company strives to be transparent by adhering to fair marketing practices in its consumer-facing communications. We are committed to accountability of information in customer facing communications also when it comes to environmental issues in line with applicable regulations (including CO\u2082 reduction, protection of biodiversity and natural habitats), health and safety.\n\nStellantis has set requirements for the marketing operations to achieve the targeted objectives. The Company also advertises its products and services in ways that follow the regional regulations and encourage responsible behavior by inviting users of mobility services such as car sharing and vehicle drivers to use them in a safe and efficient way, notably in terms of fuel economy, CO\u2082 emissions, and respect to the safety rules of the road.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nStellantis perceives Marketing\u2019s role as an opportunity to innovate, create competitive advantage, inform and educate consumers in their choices and actions. We think outlining the north star for fair, data-driven marketing practices will be the key competitive edge in the current trust revolution where consumers want to be recognized, treated uniquely, and have their personal information protected and handled carefully. On the other hand, limitations on advertising might have an impact on sales of new vehicles, advertising being a market animation tool.\n\nStellantis\u2019s brands, through their engagement in local and national advertiser associations, look for opportunities to participate in workshops on legal developments (i.e., environmental requirements in advertising, right for customers to refuse to be contacted by brands, etc.) and external stakeholders\u2019 expectations in terms of responsible communications and marketing to eliminate misleading advertising and unfair competition in the field of commercial communications.\n\nFor instance, in France, the Company, through its Public Affairs Department and the trade association Union des Marques, is following current developments of legislative proposals related to the \u201cclimate and resilience\u201d bill and the Mobility Orientation Law.\n5.3.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\n| CSR ISSUE | VISION / AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | 2021 RESULTS |\n|-----------|-------------------|----------------|------------|--------------|\n| CSR issue #13 | Provide accurate and comprehensive information to consumers through responsible marketing practices in all mass market communications, and engage them with direct communication only when they request it. | Number of convictions of non-compliance concerning: - product and service information and labeling - marketing communications | Short-term: 2022: Zero convictions Worldwide Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan): 2030: Zero convictions Worldwide Long-term: 2040: Zero convictions Worldwide | No material convictions noticed |\n\n5.3.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nThe Company\u2019s continued success is dependent on having a deep understanding of our customers while taking into account the challenges and the opportunities to address changing consumer expectations and emerging trends by offering an attractive portfolio of products.\n\n5.3.3.1 Risks\n\nThe marketing practices are designed to reduce and mitigate risks the Company might be facing:\n\n- customers\u2019 expectations of brands with respect to the environment and sustainability may not be aligned to brands\u2019 awareness to make a difference, particularly to help customers make better and conscious choices. Brands risk losing customers to competitors if they don\u2019t guide them along their sustainable journey;\n\n- in addition, our business operations and reputation may be impacted by various types of claims, lawsuits, and other contingencies in case of noncompliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations;\n\n- with the global access to digital marketing assets, the Company can be also exposed to fines if some assets from other countries are accessible and non compliant with local regulations.\n\n5.3.3.2 Opportunities\n\nResponsible marketing practices open opportunities for Stellantis:\n\n- communication recognized as responsible, transparent and easy to access (making content available to all), allowing customers to be more aware when choosing a product (products and services) contributes to differentiate Company\u2019s products encouraging customer loyalty;\n\n- marketing teams leverage their expertise to define brand strategies and implement plans that answer questions also related to environmental and societal challenges.\nincluding transparency, responsiveness and diversity. An effective brand strategy and a clear set of brand values therefore helps brand management teams capture market opportunities, implement long-term visions and support Stellantis\u2019 contribution to shape a more sustainable future;\n\n- a fair brand enhances a company\u2019s reputation, on the other hand, any unfair behavior can affect corporate intangible assets. Fair branding provides Stellantis with a differential advantage as a growing number of consumers become more conscious.\n\n5.3.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nThe Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, who is a member of the Top Executive Team and reports directly to the CEO, is responsible for a Stellantis common marketing strategy supported by CEOs of the brands, tasked with all aspects of brand strategy mission, development and positioning. Each brand has its own market share targets, brand image objectives and positioning, and is linked to the corporate values by a common marketing strategy. A comprehensive brand identity and or trademark review is completed for every customer communication to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.\n\nStellantis offers a wide spectrum of choice from luxury, premium, and mainstream passenger vehicles to pickup trucks, SUVs and light commercial vehicles, as well as dedicated mobility, financial, and parts and service brands.\n\nThe focus of the Marketing and Communications organizations is to increase the value of the brands through the development of a strategic vision for the business, on-brand marketing materials, and consumer facing communications that intend to excite and create demand for our brands and products, and to realize relevant synergies and to share best practices.\n\nBeing aware that an effective brand strategy and a clear set of brand values can support the Company to implement corporate long-term visions, the Chief Sales and Marketing Officer leverages its internal committees such as the Monthly Global Sales and Marketing Committee and the Brand Committee to coordinate marketing strategies, define priorities, ensure consistency and alignment with corporate values and implementation of responsible practices across regions.\n\nThe fulfillment of each brand strategy needs the alignment of all brand employees, as their individual commitment drives the performance of a model and/or country, efficiency of processes and sales volumes. Those efforts contribute to the achievement of the brands\u2019 targets.\n\n5.3.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nAware of the social role that advertising plays, the Company has adopted customer-centric positive values, and a responsible approach to communication, and a sense of care towards future generations. Stellantis aspires to:\n\n- provide accurate and comprehensive information through responsible marketing practices in all mass-market consumer communications only to customers who choose to receive this information. This commitment concerns all public-aimed advertising or communication broadcast on traditional media channels (TV, radio, billboard, press, etc.), on internet (websites, social media, emailing, mobile applications, online games, direct marketing, etc.) as well as commercial messages of any kind whether in print, sales promotion and merchandising materials;\n\n- honestly and clearly communicate with customers regarding environmental responsibility, allowing them to identify the most efficient vehicle choice in terms of emissions reduction (i.e., Peugeot the \u201cPOWER OF CHOICE\u201d strategy);\n\n- make statement and representations in advertising comply with all relevant laws and regulations in the local country and design processes to help advertising, marketing and media communications to be truthful and reflect the Company\u2019s fair sense of social and environmental responsibility contributing to the development of the next urban landscape (i.e., Citro\u00ebn Autonomous Mobility Vision).\n\n5.3.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nStellantis and its brands\u2019 public-aimed communication and marketing are aligned with its corporate positive values and with best marketing practices. Stellantis aims at meeting five major commitments, inspired by the French FAIRe Programme\u2019s expectations:\nCOMMITMENT 1: creating responsible messages - Stellantis ensures the messages disseminated are clear and truthful and are attentive to their impact on society.\n\nCOMMITMENT 2: eco-social-design for communication materials - Stellantis limits the environmental and social impact of its communication materials.\n\nCOMMITMENT 3: maintaining control over communication broadcast and distribution - Stellantis maintains control over the distribution of its communication and uses the data collected responsibly.\n\nCOMMITMENT 4: transparency and communication of commitments - Stellantis commits to transparency and education geared toward its stakeholders.\n\nCOMMITMENT 5: responsible relationship with partners - Stellantis maintains a fair and responsible relationship with its partners.\n\nSpecific organizations are involved with the development and review of advertising, marketing and other media communications such as Legal Department, Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Affairs, Manufacturing, among others to assure that any statements and representations made in advertising are accurate and properly substantiated.\n\nThe Company\u2019s brands also interact with several advertising industry associations at national levels. These associations provide them with high level strategic and operational support aligned to brands\u2019 interests and represent a privileged opportunity to increase the network of relationships and contacts. Bringing together several brands at local and national levels, they create a global network which offers a unique source of leadership, expertise and inspiration.\n\nFor example, in Europe some brands submit all their new advertising communications to their legal departments and to national advertising regulation agencies and in France to the Autorit\u00e9 de R\u00e9gulation Professionnelle de la Publicit\u00e9 (ARPP) to ensure that their content does not contain stereotypes. They are committed to using the Union des Marques (UDM) grid, which has been officially presented to the Brand Content teams and agencies.\n\nTraining on responsible marketing practices and responsible use of social media\n\nLegal Department provides updated guidelines and training on advertising regulations to the brands employees.\n\nIn addition to operational guidelines provided to all employees as regards the use of social media, training modules on responsible marketing practices and on responsible use of social media are conveniently delivered to marketing and communication employees.\n\nDuring 2021, employees in North America began receive communication regarding the responsible use of social media through a dedicated short video about rules expected to follow and apply.\n\n5.3.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nIMPACT MEASUREMENT OF ELECTRIFICATION AND SOFTWARE STRATEGY\n\nStellantis Brands\u2019 attributes\n\nDuring the EV Day held on July 8, 2021, Stellantis presented a comprehensive electrification strategy delivering class-leading vehicles for the Company\u2019s iconic brands, partnerships and joint ventures for advanced technology at affordable prices.\n\n\u201cThe customer is always at the heart of Stellantis and our commitment with this \u20ac30 billion plus investment plan is to offer iconic vehicles that have the performance, capability, style, comfort and electric range that fit seamlessly into their daily lives,\u201d said on that day Carlos Tavares, Chief Executive Officer, Stellantis.\n\nIn line with this announcement, on December 7, 2021, Stellantis unveiled its software strategy to shift to a mobility tech company, confirming that each of Stellantis\u2019 brands are focused on using software to the benefit of its customers.\n\nAffordability is a priority at Stellantis, as the Company is targeting for the total cost of ownership of EVs to be equivalent to internal combustion engine vehicles by 2026. Each of the Company\u2019s 14 brands is committed to offering fully electrified solutions and doing so in a way that enhances the DNA of our brands. Stellantis revealed the statements expressing each of the brand\u2019s electrification approach.\n\nStellantis EV Day 2021, Customers and Brands video.\n\nTo leverage this, Stellantis and its brands\u2019 public-aimed communication and marketing are aligned with its corporate positive values and with best marketing practices.\n\nStellantis aims to meet its five major commitments, inspired by the French FAIRe Programme\u2019s expectations.\n\nThe following examples usually apply to more than one Brand at a time and are given for illustration purposes only.\nSTELLANTIS BRANDS\u2019 ATTRIBUTES\n\nGlobal SUV\n\n- Zero Emission Freedom\n- Freedom, Connected\n\nAmerican brands\n\n- Clean Technology for a New Generation of Families\n- Built to Serve a Sustainable Planet\n- Tear Up the Streets...

The customer greeting teams at car shows are made up of equal numbers of men and women.\n\n- **Representing and promoting responsible behaviors**\n  When portraying the use of its products and services, Stellantis and its brands remain focused on topics such as sustainability and circular economy principles.\n\n  **Circular economy**\n  In 2021, in addition to direct promotion of spare parts from reused and remanufactured spare parts in the garages, circular economy initiatives are promoted in some regions on social media across Stellantis brands to inform consumers and increase their awareness.\n\n  Brands also strive to promote responsible behaviors through their online (websites, apps, etc.) and offline (TVCs, print, etc.) communication tools. This is made possible in advertising through complying to the local traffic regulations, ensuring diversity is of the essence and promoting the adoption of new energies as a better environmental choice.\n\n  **Brand apps**\n  The MyDS services allow customers to track and optimize the energy consumption of their vehicles, enable Online Booking for service appointment, allow Send-to-Nav and introduces Remote LEV services (charge and preconditioning control). These apps can be downloaded free of charge on all smartphones.\n\n  **Drive the New 500 and collect KIRI Coins**\n  The more km you drive with the New 500, the more KIRI coins you can collect. The New 500 rewards customers\u2019 driving style thanks to KIRI. KIRI is the first, eco-friendly digital coin. It is the symbol of a world that is changing perspective and in which driving the future means gifting yourself the present. Thanks to the FIAT app, customers can check their digital wallet, access the KIRI portal and use the KIRI Coins immediately for an exclusive range of eco-friendly fashion and design products. The best sustainable drivers can also have access to an extra prize to be spent on several e-commerce, digital and media service platforms.\n\n  Analysis of the driving style of New 500 customers, using the eco:Score index, has shown that the best participants in the contest drive up to 20% more efficiently than the average. This has a direct positive impact of 20% on charging costs and on the range of the New 500. The eco:Score function forms part of Uconnect\u2122 Services, assigning a score from 0 to 100 for the efficiency of driving style. This helps drivers to improve energy consumption in real time and thus to increase the car\u2019s range.\nIn 2021, Citro\u00ebn, in partnership with Accor and JCDecaux within The Urban Collectif, unveiled its new concept of urban mobility: the Citro\u00ebn Autonomous Mobility Vision. This solution offers a new form of shared, electric and autonomous urban mobility designed to optimize and re-enchant everyone\u2019s travel and thus sustainably improve the quality of life in the city.\n\nThe Citro\u00ebn Autonomous Mobility Vision concept combines the Citro\u00ebn Skate, a high-tech and universal mobility platform, with new Service Pods each offering a unique experience to explore cities in a new way. To illustrate this vision, The Urban Collectif has developed 3 innovative pods, Sofitel En Voyage, Pullman Power Fitness and JCDecaux City Provider, each of them showcasing an bespoke experience of an autonomous drive in the city.\n\nThis new concept invented for the urban mobility of tomorrow relies on an open-source approach: the Citro\u00ebn Skate platform designed to accommodate all compatible Pods developed by a partner, thereby expanding mobility and service offerings.\n\nCitro\u00ebn offers innovative approach to sustainable mobility and helps transform the Greek island of Chalki into a smart and zero emission island. Chalki becomes the first GREEK-ECO island, where Citro\u00ebn provides the mobility of all public services with a fleet of six vehicles to begin with. A wide range of solutions will also be proposed to the island residents to give them access to electric vehicles at a reasonable cost. Citro\u00ebn wants to make electrification and progress accessible to everyone in Chalki.\n\nOther events which marked 2021 are:\n\n- The prestigious \u201cInternational Van Of The Year 2021\u201d (IVOTY) award honoring the Peugeot e-Expert, Citro\u00ebn \u00eb-Jumpy, Opel Vivaro-e and Vauxhall Vivaro-e range\n- The CITRO\u00cbN ELECTRIC DRIVE event where the strategy of electrification in response to the new mobility needs was presented to international media\n- The celebration of Citro\u00ebn Ami\u2019s first anniversary, showing our commitment to urban zero emission solution\n- The launch of the PEUGEOT e-208 GT in Brazil which represents a major repositioning of the Brand, one of the strategic pillars of which is \"Move To Electric\".\n\nStellantis has taken a unique approach to customer transparency by publishing its vehicles\u2019 real (on the road) fuel consumption for Peugeot, Citroen and DS Automobile. Measurements were taken in accordance with a specific test protocol for ICE vehicles outlined by two NGOs and audited by an internationally renowned independent organization. In 2021, this transparency approach was pursued by continuing to publish the results of real consumption tests on its thermal vehicles, carried out on the basis of this protocol. Moreover, the Company chose to extend this approach to their Battery Electric Vehicles, designing and publishing a new protocol on its real electric consumption on the road, which was inspired by this philosophy and audited by the same independent organization.\n\nTo improve car buyer information, the fuel-efficiency labels display each model\u2019s average fuel consumption and CO\u2082 emissions in line with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Those labels allow to identify the most efficient vehicles in terms of fuel consumption and emissions reduction.\n\nThis was made possible in 2021 through three main areas of focus:\n\n- **Environmental and Social Criteria**\n  Stellantis has defined a set of environmental and social criteria that applies to its printed documents, Point Of Sale advertising, stands and events. We are working hard towards applying these criteria worldwide.\n\n  As an example, in Europe, we aim at using PEFC (European Programme for Certified Forests) or FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) paper for recurrent and unavoidable publications and print only the number of copies required. Our printers have \u201cImprim\u2019vert\u201d or \u201cImprim\u2019Lux\u201d certification which testifies that they sort and recycle all their printing waste and inks.\nIn France, we are a member of \u201cCiteo\u201d (recycling company mandated by the French Government): it means that our Citeo contribution is given to local authorities to support their paper sorting and collection systems.\n\nIn various regions of the world, our brands have either stopped printing most commercial and marketing documentation altogether for several years or have strongly shifted towards e-catalogs and documentation in 2021.\n\n**Licensing, revisited for the Fiat New 500**\n\nA new generation of contemporary objects and accessories has been developed for the New 500, inspired by the concepts of aesthetics and ethics and a result of the collaboration between the Centro Stile, designers and stylists. The collection, the ideal embodiment of the 500\u2019s philosophy, blends the values of beauty and transforms them into everyday accessories that celebrate the style, design and inimitable personality of the Fiat city car, yet always with a view to the future. This focus on sustainability has taken form in the selection of organic cotton for sweatshirts and T-shirts, and of recycled and vegan materials for bags and accessories. [Click here for more information](#).\n\n**Responsible events policy at Peugeot**\n\nFor trade shows, Peugeot selects suppliers who are committed to reducing the environmental impact of their stands (choice of materials used, recycling and reuse); use wood which comes entirely from sustainably-managed forests and recycle 100% of the waste from the production/demolition of the stands (wood and other materials to be recycled separately); reuse at least 35% of the stand components for other shows (floors, partitions, mezzanines, lights, screens, furniture, etc.). By factoring in the 15% of brand components which are also reused, the total of components reused in other stands is 50%.\n\n**Joint communication initiatives of brands**\n\nPeugeot, Citro\u00ebn and Opel organize joint International Press Test Drives whenever they have models in common (Light Commercial Vehicles) to make better use of resources and optimise media time and attendance. In October 2021, joint Press Test Drives were organized for Peugeot e-Partner and Citro\u00ebn \u00eb-Berlingo in the region of Paris (France).\n\n**Reasoned audiovisual productions**\n\nStellantis has committed to using local in-house teams or hiring production teams in the country where the video or photo shoots take place, whenever possible. Local and regional photo and video shootings are also encouraged as standard. Responsible practices are also required through the production briefs issued by Stellantis or its brands to their agencies. Many audiovisual productions are designed to be used in multiple markets.\n\n**Environmental Impact of Digital Media**\n\nStellantis and its brands have defined a set of environmental criteria that applies to their digital communication materials. For example, images are optimized to reduce file size, site navigation is clearly displayed to make it easy to find information and web-caching is enabled.\n\n**Environmental Impact of Digital Media**\n\nOpel regularly applies the following reference guidelines:\n\n- Coalition for Better Ads Standards (avoiding the purchase of intrusive formats);\n- Digital Ad Trust (respect for the wishes and comfort of the Internet user).\n\nOpel also endeavors to working on advertising formats in line with the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) recommendations and prioritize advertising on websites which are certified by Digital Ad Trust.\n\n**COMMITMENT 3: Maintaining control over communication broadcast and distribution - Stellantis maintains control over the distribution of its communication and uses the data collected responsibly**\n\nIn 2021, Stellantis and its brands strived to apply control over their communication broadcast and distribution through the following actions:\n\n**Controlled Broadcasting of Advertisements**\n\nStellantis and its brands control their communication broadcasting through processes in place and audience strategies, in partnership with their advertising and media agencies. The Stellantis Responsible Purchasing Guidelines, created in\n2021 includes a clause requiring suppliers to comply with the laws and regulations in force in all countries in which they operate. These Guidelines are used for all purchases made by Stellantis.\n\n- **Advertising Formats**\n  We prioritize digital advertising formats respecting user\u2019s comfort in accordance with the available reference sources, whether they be Coalition for Better Ads Standards, Digital Ad Trust, or best practices encouraged within this field depending on the region we operate in. Our media agency adheres to Coalition for Better Ads charter, hence actively encouraging our service and media providers to use these more often.\n\n- **Volume of Requests and Personal Data**\n  Stellantis and its brands are careful to limit too numerous or inappropriate requests towards its audiences and make a proper use of personal data collected, through well-established standard processes and policies in line with applicable laws and regulations (see section 5.2).\n\n  All U.S. brand eMail communications are CAN SPAM compliant, allowing customers to click to the customer preference center where they can opt out of communications. Additionally, all customer data is stored in a secure environment that is monitored regularly.\n\n- **Considering and Including all Audiences**\n  Our brands aim to add subtitling for the main advertising campaigns whenever possible, especially when it comes to online material. All U.S. websites and video content meet Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance standards.\n\n**SignLive and Citro\u00ebn**\n\nIn 2021, Citro\u00ebn UK partnered with SignLive, the leading British Sign Language (BSL) online video interpreting service, to offer customers the ability to communicate with its entire 190 Citro\u00ebn retail and aftermarket network using British Sign Language (BSL).\n\nThere are 11 million deaf and hard of hearing people in the UK, and over 150,000 British Sign Language users \u2013 Citro\u00ebn is aware that English is not the only language for many of its customers. Citro\u00ebn UK pledges to enhance accessibility for the deaf community across its business as part of its \"The French Car that Speaks your Language\" initiative, including across advertising. More information is available here.\n\n**COMMITMENT 4: Transparency and communication of commitments**\n\n- Stellantis commits to transparency and education geared toward its stakeholders\n\n  Our responsibility as a Company is to create sustainable and shared value for our stakeholders. Our customers, employees, investors, suppliers and communities expect us to make a positive contribution to the economy, society and the environment. Exchanges with our stakeholders and social groups improve mutual understanding and our ability to anticipate risks and identify opportunities for value creation, key elements of the Stellantis approach.\n\n- **Communication of commitments**\n  Stellantis communicates towards all its stakeholders regarding its environmental and social commitments in its corporate communication and in dedicated events such as EV Day and Software Day. In addition to the CSR report, summarizing our policies and achievements on those topics, Stellantis CSR visions, CSR disclosures and presentation of stakeholder dialogue are available on the dedicated section of the corporate website.\n\n  Some Stellantis brands have specific environmental visions and some communicate towards their goals and achievements on their own websites, such as the one by Peugeot.\nTransparency and education for a responsible use\n\nStellantis and its brands inform their stakeholders about the environmental and social impact of their products/services and educate them to encourage a responsible use. This is the case through our circular economy initiatives, but also regarding the daily use of our products and services.\n\nCitro\u00ebn Advisor\n\nCitro\u00ebn Advisor, AFNOR-certified in France since July 2015, is Citro\u00ebn\u2019s online review site where customers can give their opinion on the service they received at the point of sale (Advisor Dealer), the product purchased (Advisor Product) or the salesman (Advisor Salesmen). At the end of 2021, Citro\u00ebn Advisor listed over 391,000 customer reviews with an average rating of 4.8/5 and had been rolled out in 67 countries.\n\nBrands Apps\n\nOur brand apps inform and educate existing customers, supporting them in acting in a more responsible way (regarding fuel consumption, maintenance, etc.).\n\nWhen it comes to responsible mobility, the Jeep and Fiat brands also developed a specific app called \u201cGo-e\u201d (i.e., GO 4xe LIVE and Fiat GOe LIVE) in Europe to promote electric mobility, highlighting the benefits to users and support the launch of their electric models.\n\nIn addition in 2021, the experts from Fiat Professional and Stellantis e-Mobility have worked in close collaboration to create a functional web tool, Pro Fit by E-Ducato, designed for anyone interested \u2013 specifically addressed to fleet managers and freelancers \u2013 to find out about the advantages of the new electric version of the Ducato, the Fiat\u2019s first zero-emissions commercial vehicle.\n\nCOMMITMENT 5: Responsible relationship with partners - Stellantis maintains a fair and responsible relationship with its partners\n\nStellantis Responsible Purchasing Guidelines were created in 2021 and signed by the Company\u2019s accredited suppliers. They govern most of the topics developed below:\n\nEnvironmental and Social Commitments from Partners\n\nStellantis Responsible Purchasing Guidelines, created in 2021 includes environmental and social criteria (consistent with the spirit underlying the ILO recommendations) as supplier selection and retention in the Stellantis Supplier panel are guided by corporate and social responsibility (CSR) criteria.\n\nWaste management policy\n\nIn France, some of Stellantis brands are working with a supplier specialized in the production and design or stands and event spaces that implemented the ISO 2021 certification - an international standard for the responsible management of event activities, and is processing its wastes in a strict manner, in order to enter into a circular economy logic.\n\nThis supplier has thus equipped its two French sites with specific waste collection channels to sort out various materials after each event: wood, paper, cardboard, floor coverings and paint canisters.\n\nA Sustainable Policy has also been signed with Stellantis.\n\nTransparency, Truthfulness and Accountability in Calls for Tenders\n\nWe strive to uphold the principles of transparency, truthfulness and accountability in calls for tenders.

PROMOTING PROTECTION AND IMPLEMENTING RESPONSIBLE USE OF NATURAL RESOURCE\n\nThe global economy is facing the challenges of increasing scarcity and an over-use of natural resources (water, minerals, raw materials, rare earths, etc.) combined with their geographical concentration. The United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals confirm the urge to find solutions both for the environment and political stability, which are key levers of sustainability for companies like Stellantis.\n\nIn this context of scarcity of natural resources, preserving them, including the quality of the air, a precious natural resource on which human health depends, and reducing our dependence on water and raw materials are both a question of environmental responsibility and of sustainability for businesses. Automakers need to rethink the materials adopted in mobility devices and their production processes.\n\nIn order to save resources while providing new sources of income, Stellantis has strengthened the sustainable and circular economy approach, by conducting LCA studies on vehicles, deploying engineering research and development around new more sustainable materials, the recovery of parts and materials and improving manufacturing processes. Stellantis strives to improve the performance of our factories by reducing water consumption, managing the quantity and disposal of waste and other nuisances generated by production, while integrating the need to protect the biodiversity of the surrounding areas. We design vehicles with the goal to reduce the environmental impact including when the vehicle has reached the end of its useful life.\n\n6.1 WISE USE OF MATERIALS IN THE VEHICLE LIFE CYCLE (INCLUDING PRODUCT RECYCLING)\n\n6.1.1 CONTEXT AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\nCSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE #14: Wise use of material in the vehicle life cycle (including product recycling)\n\nBy 2060, the Earth is expected to have ten billion people whose average income might be equivalent to that of the richest countries today. The OECD estimates that the use of raw materials will double to meet this growth, exerting twice as much pressure on the environment.\n\nStellantis understands the challenges connected to this trend and is working to extend the lifespan of products and reduce the use of natural resources within a circular economy approach. We are making progress and developing ways to increase the use of renewable and recycled materials, in using reused, repaired and remanufactured parts to continue the vehicles in service including traction batteries and in processing end-of-life products and vehicles in a responsible manner with a focus on batteries from electrified vehicles.\n\nWe are working to overcome the use of hazardous substances targeted by regulations such as, REACH. We are also working to find alternatives for the use of rare and precious resources which are often indispensable for nanotechnologies. In some cases, these materials are required for connected vehicles and technologies making them dependent on their availability.\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nThe principle of a circular economy is embedded into Stellantis\u2019s business approach, focusing on reducing waste in the value chain from vehicle design through production, distribution, use and reuse of materials.\n\nStellantis promotes the repair of its products and, as such, develops a range of remanufactured spare parts and offers second-hand parts and a spare parts repair service. Through its action within a representative structure of automobile manufacturers such as, for example, the Association of European Automobile Manufacturers (ACEA) or the Automotive Industry Platform (PFA), it also supports the development of a harmonized methodology for measuring the rate of incorporation of recycled and natural materials.\n\n6.1.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\n| CSR ISSUE | VISION / AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | 2021 RESULTS |\n|-----------|-------------------|----------------|------------|--------------|\n| CSR issue #14 | Wise use of material in the vehicle life cycle (including product recycling) | Innovate with eco-design and leverage end-of-life opportunities in a circular economy approach to reduce the use of natural resources and the environmental impact to the lowest possible level. | Percentage of Green Materials (includes renewable and recycled content with lower carbon footprint materials) on total vehicle weight | 2025: launch the first vehicles containing 25% of Green Materials | Green Materials applied on vehicles in major regions |\n| Owners | Chief Engineering Officer | Availability of solutions to optimize High Voltage Batteries lifespan and End of Life through Repair, Remanufacturing, 2nd life, Recycling | 2025: at least one solution is implemented for each High Voltage Battery sold in EU, NA, China | 2030: at least one solution is implemented for each High Voltage Battery in all countries where EVs are sold | Repair Solution launched in France and Germany |\n| | | | 2050: all solutions implemented in all countries where EVs are sold | Reman Solution in Europe and North America | 2nd Life process in place one in Europe and one |\n| | | | Recycling process in place in Europe, North America and China |\n6.1.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nThe automotive industry is facing a transformation that is impacting several aspects of its business: the materials used to build a vehicle are a key issue OEMs need to tackle. Stellantis has identified four types of risks in this area and implemented mitigation measures which open the way to opportunities of gaining competitive advantages or creating new businesses.\n\nRISK#1: Scarcity of critical materials\n\nThe availability of limited resources could generate scarcity of materials, included those critical. Stellantis defines the criticality of a material according to three criteria:\n\n- **use criticality**: materials where there are currently no alternatives, that are used for special features and which are important for competitiveness;\n- **supply criticality/potential scarcity**: limited global quantity or unreliable supply chains;\n- **CSR criticality**: the extraction or use of these materials is questionable from a CSR viewpoint such as environmental impact and breach of human rights.\n\nTransition to electrified vehicles is generating need for new raw materials such as lithium, nickel and cobalt. Demand for the materials needed for nanotechnologies is greater than ever. Rare earths show tensions in their market. Some stages of the polymers production process show a high concentration of among a small number of suppliers.\n\nIn order to mitigate the related impacts such as the increase in production costs, supply chain disruptions or delays and dependency following measures are implemented (see section 6.1.7):\n\n- limit and reduce the use of critical materials;\n- identify and monitor materials considered as strategic;\n- develop alternative materials to substitute those critical materials;\n- sign contracts with critical material suppliers such as the lithium geothermal partners to secure supply;\n- use LCA extensively to measure and reduce environmental impacts.\n\nIn addition, in order to address the challenges of accessing sustainable raw materials, Stellantis partners with the European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA). Stellantis participates in a working group oriented on rare earths for e-machine used for permanent magnets. The other working group will cover raw-materials for batteries. Stellantis has launched several initiatives, which open technical and business opportunities:\n\n- develop a dual chemistry strategy based on two cobalt free batteries from 2024 (see section 2.5.3.2.4);\n- increase circular economy opportunities, using materials and designing components that are easier to recover and recycle at the end of their life, recycling materials that are becoming scarce and reusing them inside or outside the automotive sector (for more information, see section 6.1.7);\n- reuse or remanufacture part to reduce demand (see section 6.1.7);\n- use of Green Materials such as recycled or material of natural origin (see section 6.1.7).\n\nRISK#2: Increased regulations on hazardous substances\n\nRegulatory requirements regarding the use of hazardous substances that can impact the environment together with the health and safety of customers and employees could increase in the future.\n\nIn order to mitigate the related impacts such as costs of potential non-compliance as well as cost and availability of substitute materials, following measures are implemented (see section 6.1.7):\n\n- factor regulatory requirements regarding the use of hazardous substances into the phases of the vehicle life cycle;\n- reduce and eliminate hazardous substances such as limiting Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in the materials used and substituting some substances used as plasticizers or flame retardants that are targeted by regulations such as REACH;\nmonitor traceability of regulated substances contained in vehicle parts and materials, notably by working closely with suppliers to achieve compliance of vehicles and parts sold.\n\nStellantis has launched several initiatives, which open technical opportunities:\n\n- anticipate regulations by mastering impact of possible future changes;\n- improve cabin health and safety voluntarily introducing technical solutions such as filters for air flow (see section 6.1.7).\n\n**RISK#3: Increased regulation on End-of-Life processes**\n\nChanges in End of Life Vehicles (ELV) regulations could affect the dismantling and recycling sector by adding additional requirements to the Authorized Treatment Facilities (ATFs), increasing the responsibility of the OEMs to manage the entire end-of-life handling process. In some regions of the world such as EU and China, legislation requires producers to ensure treatment at the end-of-life of High Voltage Batteries (HVB).\n\nThe EU has initiated a review process which will increase producer\u2019s obligations and generate the likely risk of additional surcharges.\n\nThe value of an entire ELV from reused parts and recycled materials cover all cost related to collection, depollution and dismantling as well as recycling and recovery of all material streams.\n\nImpacts resulting from the combination of cost increase and reduced revenues can be explained by the increase of producer\u2019s obligations on the global ELV process. This trend is reinforced by the HVB end of life treatment.\n\nIn order to mitigate these impacts, following measures are implemented:\n\n- use materials and design components that are compatible with the circular economy, focusing on the need to recover and recycle end-of-life vehicles;\n- deploy responsible process of end-of-life products specifically the vehicles and batteries from electrified vehicles (see section 6.1.7);\n- work with stakeholders and authorities to define optimized ELV management structure.\n\nStellantis has launched several initiatives, which open technical and business opportunities:\n\n- develop a Circular Economy Business Unit to offer customers the option of reused parts, generating additional revenues and economic balance of the process;\n- participate in or acquire innovative startups such as Amanh\u00e3 Global (see section 6.1.7);\n- reduce the variety of plastics to facilitate sorting after shredding and improve profitability;\n- use a single family of plastics per core function so that an entire sub-assembly can be recycled without dismantling;\n- mark plastic parts with standardized codes for identification, sorting and traceability;\n- introduce green materials (recycled) into vehicle design to support the development of recycling opportunities (see section 6.1.7).\n\nSpecific impacts of upcoming regulations notably in EU and China might lead to increase the producers\u2019 obligations and generate the likely risk of additional costs. To mitigate this risk, Stellantis is implementing measures to reduce logistics costs, extend the HVB lifespan before recycling through repair and remanufacturing or repurpose the HVB or its components for energy storage outside of the automotive sector with possible revenue generation.\n\n**RISK#4: Low environmental and human rights respect in supply chain during extraction phase of some minerals**\n\nSome raw materials or minerals could come from a region of the world where environmental and social regulations are not aligned with the Company\u2019s values and standards or where conflicts are open (Tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold - also known as 3TG - are \u201cconflict minerals\u201d for which the mining can provide a source of funding for war).\n\nCompanies are working to meet growing expectations of stakeholders (including shareholders, employees, customers and NGOs) to take responsibility for their supplier\u2019s environmental and social practices.\nIn order to mitigate the related reputational or financial impacts in case of litigations, following measures are implemented:\n\n- implement a due diligence process which strives to limit the use of materials from responsible supply chains respecting human rights and the environment (for more information, see section 7);\n- introduce a traceability system for supplies that contain conflict minerals (for more information, see section 7.2.4). Stellantis pays particular attention to the materials used in batteries for electrified vehicles through the supply chain and supports initiatives for innovative supplies of raw materials;\n- develop partnerships such as the European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA) (for more information, see section 6.1.7).\n\nNANOTECHNOLOGIES IN THE AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR\n\nNanotechnologies are a relevant illustration of the combination of those risks while demand for the materials they require is greater than ever in the context of the increased appetite for connected objects. This trend also affects the automotive industry. Metals used to support nanotechnologies experience market tensions and are increasingly harder to mine: the metal content of the ore is decreasing, while mines currently operated show lower concentrations which implies more and more processing. Stellantis is focused on limiting and reducing the use of these metals and increasing the recovery during the recycling phase.\n\n6.1.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nA materials strategy monitored at strategy council level\n\nThe Global Purchasing and Supply Chain EVP and the Engineering EVP, both direct reports to the CEO, and members of the Top Executive Team and the Strategy Council are responsible for the materials strategy. Mapping of material risks for both current and forecasts, is performed according to specific criteria for each raw material. Some of the criteria include:\n\n- significant contribution to develop existing technologies;\n- scarcity and geographic location;\n- social and environmental impacts including recyclability and extraction or production conditions;\n- geopolitical or logistic accessibility;\n- cost and share of Stellantis needs compared to global market demand and market players.\n\nBased on this risk mapping, the EVPs validate the R&D roadmap on substitute materials or alternative supplies, to manage and secure the Company\u2019s sourcing over the long-term, notably through collaborative actions with metallurgy and mining industries.\n\nThe Finance Department performs cost monitoring on materials in connection with operational purchasing plus research and development teams. Their goal is to anticipate and manage cost developments, help diversify and monitor the most strategic supplies. In the context of increasing scarcity and costs of raw materials on the long-term, the supplier relationship is a lever to implement the Company material and product development policies. Stellantis focuses its efforts on the materials used in batteries for electrified vehicles through the supply chain (for more information, see section 7.1.3) and supports initiatives for innovative supplies of raw materials.\n\nA Circular Economy Business Unit\n\nStellantis leverages its knowledge and experience of recycling and has created a business unit dedicated to the circular economy. In order to better master the material scarcity, the aim of the business unit is to build a sustainable and profitable business based on circular economy principles in the markets were the Company operates, where possible. The Circular Economy Business Unit is responsible for defining targets, guidelines and supporting regional team activities within project development through logistics, sales and marketing. It has central oversight, profit and loss responsibility and there are regional budgets and targets. It is tasked with coordinating with other departments such as engineering, purchasing and manufacturing to spread the Circular Economy mindset. In order to develop the\ncircular economy business, the Business Unit investigates opportunities in various areas such as the use of plant surplus, end-of-life vehicle parts and remanufacturing parts, recycled material in a closed-loop process, based on the capacity to recover valuable waste from customers \u201cRenew\u201d and \u201cRegen\u201d labels have been added to promote the sustainability characteristics of these parts and services. Participation in innovative startups is also part of their roadmap: a participation has been signed with Amanh\u00e3 Global in 2020 and two members of their Board belong to Circular Economy Business Unit to provide synergies with the Company.\n\nPre-owned vehicles activity\n\nStellantis has decided to dedicate a specific business unit to pre-owned vehicles (PROV), with a worldwide scope, leveraging its experience as an OEM but also a global ecosystem including companies such as Aramis Group or Autobiz. PROV business unit is responsible for defining pre-owned activities strategy, targets, key projects, business guidelines and for supporting all regional entities. It has central oversight and accountability for pre-owned activities global financial results.\n\nRegarding companies dedicated to this business, PROV business unit ensures strategic oversight and consistency through Board participation, in line with corporate governance rules, and provides them with the adequate support through synergies with Stellantis activities. PROV Business unit continuously looks for additional opportunities to develop new business, including through partnerships with innovative start-ups (like Autoavaliar in Brazil or Fengche in China).\n\nAll Stellantis pre-owned vehicle activities aim to operate in compliance both with applicable regulations and Stellantis policies enforcing best practices regarding safety at work (including in our reconditioning facilities), competition laws, diversity, respect for customer data privacy protection and customer information, which is paramount to present our offers both digitally and on physical sites. For more information, refer to section 6.1.7.\n\n6.1.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nStellantis considers materials impact at all stages of the life cycle starting from the product definition through the design phase. The materials and circular economy policy is based on the following principles:\n\n- eco design to boost innovation and contribute to reduce material consumption and environmental impact of materials;\n- an assertive commitment to use green materials;\n- a commitment to reduce hazardous substances;\n- a commitment to responsible recyclability - as a prevention measure against material scarcity and environmental impact of raw material sourcing - and to a responsible end of life treatment;\n- a commitment to provide customers with offers in the circular economy mindset: sustainable parts and service offers to increase the lifespan of their vehicle, verified pre-owned cars, remanufactured parts.\n\nEco design to boost innovation and reduce material consumption and environmental impact of materials\n\nFrom the vehicle design through each stage of the vehicle life cycle, Stellantis works to limit the vehicle\u2019s environmental footprint in line with applicable regulations by:\n\n- improving fuel consumption;\n- reducing CO\u2082 emissions and pollutants;\n- using natural resources responsibly;\n- improving recyclability and repairability and remanufacturability.\n\nIn addition to supporting vehicle compliance with environmental legislation, eco-design also helps the Company stay competitive regarding sustainable mobility and new materials.\n| LIFE CYCLE STAGES | CORE CHALLENGES |\n|-------------------|------------------|\n| Product definition | Define new automotive products and services taking into account the mobility needs of consumers around the world, local legislation and people\u2019s expectations regarding the environment and safety. |\n| Design and engineering | Design vehicles to reduce their impact:  \n  - on the environment: CO\u2082 emissions, local pollutants, the use of resources and recyclability;  \n  - on society: road safety, noise pollution, traffic congestion. |\n| Production | Reduce the environmental impact of automobile manufacturing.  \n  Improve workplace safety.  \n  Participate in the economic and social life of local communities. |\n| Transport and sale | Integrate environmental challenges into supply chain and dealership network management.  \n  Inform customers in a responsible manner through advertising and labelling and provide a satisfying ownership experience with effective sales and customer service processes. |\n| Use | Help limit the impact associated with vehicle use: promote safe and environment friendly driving practices, reduce vehicle fuel consumption, and develop increasingly effective exhaust emission control systems.  \n  Promote the use of parts from circular economy in vehicle maintenance and repair. |\n| End-of-life | Facilitate the collection and processing of end-of-life vehicles and components by specialized providers and optimize their recyclability (pollution control, recycling, recovery and reuse). Evaluate the business opportunities to create circular economy offers to our customers and optimize the effort to collect and treat end-of-life vehicles and in particular the HVBs. |\n\nIn order to be a strong participant in the circular economy market, the Company is developing internal procedures and partnerships with industrial counterparts from the automotive industry and other sectors. This is helping to reduce the pressure on natural resources for the different stages of the life cycle of our vehicles.\n\nThe Company is implementing a life cycle analysis procedure to evaluate and validate the selection of materials in new projects. This action allows to improve the use of natural resources and to limit the impact of products on the environment throughout their useful life. Each stage of the life cycle and the main environmental issues are examined (see 6.1.7).\n\nThis policy to search for new materials is being implemented in conjunction with the Company\u2019s commitment to using more renewable, recycled or bio-sourced materials in its vehicles.\n\n**Spare parts verified to boost safety, environmental protection and compliance**\n\nStellantis pays close attention to the selection of material to comply with regulations, notably those related to safety. Due to their strong visual resemblance to branded parts, customers might be misled by counterfeit parts. A poor quality of counterfeit parts can endanger consumer safety. In the automotive field in particular, counterfeit products do not offer guarantees in terms of safety, environmental protection or regulatory requirements. In order to allow customers, after-market and custom networks to identify genuine parts, the various brands of Stellantis use a secure label placed on replacement parts packaging.\n\n**An assertive commitment to use green materials**\n\nStellantis is involved in the integration of recycled and natural materials in the Company\u2019s vehicles. The integration of recycled materials covers all materials used in vehicles. Green materials used in the vehicles can be defined in three categories:\n\n- recycled materials;\n- materials of natural origin such as, wood and plant fibers;\n- bio-sourced materials such as, polymers that come from renewable resources rather than the petrochemical industry.\nThere are several advantages to using them including reduced use of mined and fossil-based materials and fostering the development of the recycling industries by increasing demand. Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) are conducted to check and highlight the environmental progress of new green material solutions.\n\nA commitment to reduce hazardous substances\n\nStellantis focuses its attention on the environment and the health and safety of their customers and employees.\n\nRegarding hazardous substance management, the main drivers are:\n\n- the elimination of four heavy metals; lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium which are regulated by the European Directive No 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles and its exemptions list mentioned in Annex II;\n- compliance with the REACH regulation. As the last production phase of the supply chain, the Company has set up an organization and communication system to monitor its partners and suppliers using the REACH automotive industry guidelines. Stellantis contributed to the drafting of the regulation as a member of the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association (ACEA);\n- the voluntary introduction of technical solutions to improve vehicle interior air quality to support customer health, safety and comfort in the cabin, in addition to regulatory requirements.\n\nA commitment to responsible recyclability\n\nAs a prevention measure against material scarcity and environmental impact of raw material sourcing, to support a responsible end of life treatment.\n\nThe impact of recycling end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) is taken into account starting from the design phase. Vehicle materials are selected according to increasingly strict criteria that are designed to foster the development of recovery and recycling facilities. To ensure that its vehicles are highly recyclable, Stellantis is committed to:\n\n- using materials that are easy to recycle;\n- reducing the variety of plastics to facilitate sorting after shredding, optimize the related recovery processes and improve profitability;\n- using a single family of plastics per core function so that an entire sub-assembly can be recycled without dismantling;\n- marking plastic parts with standardized codes for identification, sorting and traceability;\n- introducing green materials, especially recycled materials, into vehicle design to support the emergence or development of new markets for certain materials;\n- integrating recycling considerations upstream in the innovation phases with a focus on new materials or vehicle parts.\n\nAs a participant in the International Dismantling Information System (IDIS) project, Stellantis provides recycling facilities with disassembly instructions for our vehicle brands. Stellantis is performing vehicle recycling studies in France, Germany and Canada to support vehicle end-of-life research and development and to satisfy dismantling requirements for ELVs.\n\nA commitment to responsible end of life treatment\n\nAs part of the Circular Economy Business Unit, one central ELV team integrates ELV activities for Stellantis brands.\n\nThis allows synergies to be increased by:\n\n- exchanging information with authorities at regional and country levels;\n- streamlining Stellantis ELV activities in countries in Europe and in regions outside of Europe;\n- negotiating with Stellantis partners in the full ELV chain at central and local levels;\n- contributing to the work by automobile associations at country, European and global levels;\n- analyzing and generating new business and revenue opportunities.\nA commitment to provide customers with offers in the circular economy mindset: verified pre-owned vehicles, remanufactured parts\n\n- Stellantis already offers a full range of remanufactured parts that support the aftermarket needs of customers. These parts help to reduce the cost of vehicle ownership, decrease the volume of materials heading to landfills and lower energy consumption. The Company certifies the production of remanufactured parts, manufactured internally or through specialized providers, in order to provide a repair solution that is equivalent to original equipment parts and provides the same warranty conditions as new parts.\n\n- Stellantis Pre-owned vehicles policy: Stellantis pre-owned vehicles activity echoes directly the Company mission, \u201cpowered by our diversity, we lead the way the world moves\u201d, focusing on proposing safe, clean and affordable mobility solutions to our customers. Our pre-owned vehicles are mainly recent, certified to meet quality standard, and more affordable than brand new models. In addition, providing used vehicles participate in a growing circular model helping to preserve natural resources needed to build a car.\n\n6.1.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nEco-design product development organization\n\nIntegrated in the Materials and Sustainability Engineering Department, teams are dedicated to develop and monitor sustainable eco-design worldwide. The mission is to implement eco-design process in accordance with the different Stellantis commitments:\n\n- monitor and reduce the use of hazardous substances;\n- increase the use of green materials;\n- implement recyclable solutions;\n- evaluate the environmental footprint of new solutions and complete vehicles thanks to Life Cycle Assessments;\n- monitor dedicated KPIs, performance and conduct research.\n\nIn order to conduct these actions, standards and tools are defined and implemented to monitor design criteria applied by engineering teams. In particular, standards are defined to limit and trace the use of hazardous substances or to specify the green material content. For instance, materials specifications are defined for major plastic parts to integrate minimum of Green Materials content. IMDS is mainly used to monitor material composition of the parts including hazardous substances identification.\n\nCircular economy business unit\n\nStellantis has a business unit dedicated to the circular economy. The goal of the business unit is to build a sustainable business based on circular economy principles. A dedicated central team works with regional teams of various sizes depending on the local footprint of Stellantis. The business unit uses common resources from central or regional teams from other departments including engineering, quality, purchasing or manufacturing, after-sales, suppliers and other providers. Amanh\u00e3 Global, a subsidiary of Stellantis, has its own resources to support their growth plan.\n\nHigh Voltage Batteries (HVB) Management\n\nThe Company is implementing collection and treatment procedures for its High-Voltage Batteries (HVB) used in hybrid and electric vehicles sold in Europe and other regions. Stellantis offers longer lifespan mobility to their customers by developing repair and remanufacturing processes. Stellantis is also targeting to extend the battery lifespan through second-life solutions outside of the automotive sector for energy storage including those through its joint Venture with NHOA (ex Engie EPS) Free2Move eSolution. Stellantis is responsible for the recycling of its HVBs and contracts with specific operators selected to collect and recycle HVBs from our plants, research and development sites, dealer network and end-of-life vehicles. The battery technology in electric and hybrid vehicles requires specific handling methods.\n6.1.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nEXAMPLES OF SOME OF THE TYPICAL CIRCULAR ECONOMY INITIATIVES BY STELLANTIS\n\nRECYCLING OF PLANT WASTE\n(See 6.4.4.2)\n\n1.

Main initiatives to support Eco design and reduce material consumption: the LCA approach\n\nStellantis conducts Life Cycle Assessment (LCAs) on its vehicles and components. These studies analyze the multi-criteria environmental footprint of a vehicle, its components and materials design. The entire product life cycle is taken into account from raw material extraction to manufacture, use and end-of-life. The methodology used for LCAs refers to ISO standards 14040/44 and critical reviews are conducted with external experts. The last critical review focused on battery electric vehicle DS3 Crossback e-tense performed by a third-party reviewer panel.\n\nThe results of life cycle assessments help to improve the vehicles\u2019 environmental record:\n- highlighting the environmental advantage of one innovative solution compared to another, and more broadly, the overall environmental impact of a product\n- identifying possible pollution transfers from one phase of the life cycle to another\n- highlighting core environmental impacts\n- choosing more environmentally friendly technologies and materials.\n\nMain Indicators of Environmental Impacts Monitored by Stellantis\n\n| IMPACT ON AIR | Global warming potential in kg CO\u2082-eq: characterizes the average increase in greenhouse gases emissions that contribute to global warming (CO\u2082, CH\u2084, N\u2082O, etc.). |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|               | Acidification potential in kg SO\u2082-eq: characterizes the increase in the content of acidifying substances that cause acid rain and decay of some forests (SO\u2082, etc.). |\n|               | Photochemical ozone creation potential in kg ethene eq.: characterizes the phenomena leading to the formation of ozone which have harmful effects on human health and on ecosystems (VOCs, etc.). |\n| IMPACT ON WATER | Eutrophication potential in kg phosphate eq.: characterizes the introduction of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate compounds that promote the growth of certain algae (NO\u2083, etc.). |\n| IMPACT ON NATURAL RESOURCES | Potential for the depletion of natural mineral resources in kg antimony eq.

The analyses are usually conducted at the end of product design and include recyclability and critical materials.\n\nFormer PSA was a founding member of the EcoSD network, an association whose main purpose is to foster interaction between researchers and industry players to create and disseminate Eco-Sustainable Design (EcoSD) expertise in France and beyond, thereby promoting France\u2019s EcoSD expertise internationally. The Company participates in collaborative projects with industry and laboratory members of the network, with the support of the French Agency for Ecological Transition (ADEME).\nAchievements of these projects include:\n\n- an assessment of the methodology used to measure the \u201cwater footprint\u201d of an entire vehicle;\n- the creation of a tool which takes environmental criteria into account in the design of traction batteries for electric vehicles;\n- the development of a guide with good practices for LCA practitioners on using mineral depletion indicators and on taking into account material criticality issues;\n- The publication of a \u201cWhite Book\u201d with edition of Presses des Mines, on the application of monetarization in LCA for eco-design purposes;\n- An assessment of the environmental profile of the data in the context of connected vehicles;\n- An assessment of the environmental profile of charging infrastructures for BEVs in the context of long distance drive.\n\nIn addition, Ph.D. thesis work has been conducted, focused on the development of a method to optimize environmental impacts of automotive product and service systems such as car-sharing. Another Ph.D. candidate begin work in early 2020 regarding the development of a method for implementing CSR KPIs in the design phase of vehicles.\n\nThe Company aims to implement life cycle assessments on new vehicles. For core technological changes or strategic innovations, studies are conducted to assess developments of the environmental impact from these technologies.\n\nExamples of the application of LCAs\n\nThese analyses are carried out using software linked to environmental databases that makes it possible to calculate a product\u2019s environmental impact. The goal is to compare the environmental impact from a new model compared to the previous generation. The impact of new electrified powertrain is also evaluated. Examples of vehicles that have been assessed during the passed year:\n\n- Citroen C4 gasoline and electric;\n- Citroen AMI;\n- Citroen Berlingo diesel and electric;\n- DS4 gasoline;\n- Fiat 500 gasoline and electric;\n- Fiat Pulse flex fuel;\n- Jeep Commander flex fuel and diesel;\n- Jeep COMPASS gasoline, MHEV and PHEV;\n- Opel Corsa gasoline and electric;\n- Opel Mokka gasoline and electric;\n- New Peugeot 308;\n- Peugeot Expert diesel and electric;\n- Peugeot Partner diesel and electric;\n\n**RESULT OF THE LIFE-CYCLE ANALYSIS DONE ON THE PEUGEOT 508**\n\n| Global warming | Depletion of mineral resources | Air acidification | Water eutrophication | Photochemical ozone creation |\n|----------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Peugeot 508 - 2011 | 100%                          | 80%               | 60%                  | 40%                         | 20%                         |\n| Peugeot 508 - 2018 | 100%                          | 80%               | 60%                  | 40%                         | 20%                         |\n\nLCAs covered 62% of the total fleet sold (in 2021)\n6.1.7.2. Main initiatives to boost the integration of green materials:\n\nStellantis plans to integrate a green materials monitoring system focused on recycled and natural materials in new vehicles. We are focusing on recycled polymers as an important part of the circular economy and increasing our research efforts. The wider application of green materials requires the development of robust supply chains and more research on new materials. To meet its targets, the Company is actively selecting and certifying materials that offer the best cost and technical application, thereby creating a portfolio of solutions for future vehicle projects. The use of green materials will continue to be included in the engineering design guidelines and in the specifications for supplying parts and components. The use of green materials is also one of the selection criteria when choosing suppliers.\n\nStellantis is involved in a large number of scientific partnerships to boost the development of the green materials industry and expand the use of these materials in vehicles. In 2021 Stellantis participated in:\n\n- **BIOMass** for the future miscanthus: through the Regional Association of the Automotive Industry of \u00cele-de-France. Stellantis is a partner of this project alongside the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRAE). The Company\u2019s involvement consists of taking part in the validation tests of materials containing miscanthus fibers. The project led to the validation of moldability with representative parts and the complete validation of one material PP-NF30.\n\n- **RUSTINE project**; extruded recycling for the recovery of polymer waste sponsored by Fonds Unique Interminist\u00e9riel (FUI) with industrial and academic partners (Galloo Plastics, Wipak, Nutripack, Umet and Armines). The objective is to develop a process for decontaminating plastic waste from different sectors, in particular automobile. Stellantis aims to develop validated products with recycled polyolefin materials for interior parts without losing the properties of virgin materials, in particular odor and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs).\n\n- **PRIME project** studies the opportunities of innovative processes and products of green chemistry to support the development of biopolymers from agro-industrial wastes (side streams containing sugars not in competition with the food chain, waste oils and other vegetable fractions) of the Piedmont territory in Italy to obtain biobased building blocks (diacids and diols) through chemical and fermentative routes for high performance biopolyester plastics and fibers for automotive parts.\n\n- **LIFE PlasPLUS project** aims innovative technology challenging the current state of-the-art recycling process and transforming the current downcycled or landfilled/incinerated waste in high-purity secondary thermoplastics. The project, supported by European Commission enable new recycled plastics for automotive improving the recycling of high-quality secondary thermoplastics and critical raw materials found in end-of-life vehicle waste (ELV) and waste of the electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE).\n\n- **SALEMA project**, supported by European Commission, develops a combined strategy of decreasing the critical raw material dependency (from magnesium and silicon) and creating a sustainable circular economy in the aluminum manufacturing industry of Europe, since electric automotive sector needs high-performance, sustainable aluminum sources, that is only possible by the generation of a new aluminum ecosystem.\n\nThe latest vehicles brought to the market illustrate the results obtained on the inclusion of materials that are recycled or from natural sources. The following examples show the diversity of applications validated on the last vehicles from the different brands in the main regions of commercialization:\n\nIn Enlarged Europe:\n\n- **Fiat 500e, Fiat 500 MHEV**, and **Fiat Panda MHEV** use 100% Recycled PET (30% from bottles recovered in the sea and 70% from post-consumer) for the textile in the seats.\n\n- **Jeep Compass** uses 85% post-consumer PET for rear seat backrest.\n\n- **Bio based polycarbonate is used for air conditioner command lens for Fiat Tipo and on key cover Fiat 500e**.\n\n- **DS4 Crossback**: more than 50 parts (dashboard, console, carpets...) of the new DS4 are made by recycled polymers and/or natural fibers.\n\n- **The new Peugeot 308 and 308SW** integrate 100% of post-consumer polypropylene in the Bumpers components and polypropylene with natural fibers in the dashboard.\n\n- **Opel MOKKA** uses High quality Polyamide and recycled PET respectively in under hood applications and carpets.\n\n- **Citro\u00ebn AMI** uses recycled polypropylene on upper bulkhead.\nIn North America:\n\n- **Jeep Wrangler**: uses recycled high heat Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate (ASA) materials for Spare tire carrier cover, high recycled content TPO materials for Console, and Wrangler used recycled polypropylene in the Quarter trim panels.\n\n- **Ram Truck** uses glass fiber reinforced recycled polypropylene for floor storage bins, post-industrial recycled Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate (ASA) materials for fascia brackets, post-industrial recycled polypropylene filled with talc for cowl screens, as well as recycled high density polyethylene materials for the wheel liners.\n\n- Suede with recycled content is used for headliners for **Jeep Grand Wagoneer** and **Jeep Grand Cherokee** and also for interior pillars for Jeep Grand Cherokee.\n\n- **Jeep Grand Cherokee** uses recycled content in glass/mineral filled thermoplastic polyester blend (PBT/PET) for vent vanes, as well as recycled content in talc-filled polypropylene for support assemblies, and glass/mineral filled recycled PA6 for heat shield.\n\nIn South America:\n\n- **Citro\u00ebn C4 Cactus** uses recycled polypropylene in fuel tank deflector, fascia panel ventilation channel, wheel housing mudguard, air anti-recycling bulkhead.\n\n- **New Fiat Strada and Fiat Pulse** use recycled polypropylene in wheel housing mudguards and in the front bumper deflector for **Fiat Pulse**.\n\n- **Jeep Compass** develops the mobile rear shelf in recycled polypropylene and wood fibers (composite).\n\n### 6.1.7.3. Main initiatives to reduce hazardous substances\n\n**Regulatory requirements** regarding the use of hazardous substances are factored into the phases of the vehicle life cycle. We work closely with suppliers on achieving compliance of vehicles and parts sold. To ensure the traceability of regulated substances contained in vehicle parts and materials, the Company collects information from suppliers using the automotive standard International Material Data System (IMDS) tool according to the Global Automotive Declarable Substance List (GADSL).\n\nFor European vehicles, Stellantis has set the goal of minimizing the use of substances on the REACH candidate list and anticipating the restrictions in Annexes XIV and XVII by working upstream during the new material research and innovation phases.\n\nExamples include the replacement of diethylhexyl phtalate (DEHP) which is used as a plasticizer in PVC sheaths for wiring harnesses. Other regulations on chemical substances such as Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP) and Biocides which affect part design and production are also monitored for compliance.\n\n**Concerning Vehicle interior air quality**, in addition to working to adhere to regulatory requirements, Stellantis has voluntarily introduced technical solutions to support customer health, safety and comfort in the cabin. These include filters for air flow into the passenger compartment and limits on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the materials used. Where applicable, the air in the passenger compartment is checked for VOCs and odors before the vehicle goes to the market. Stellantis is working on new developments accounting for specific material characteristics, surface treatments and filters to improve the quality of the interior air, limiting also the development of micro-organisms.\n\n### 6.1.7.4. Main initiatives to improve responsible recyclability and to support End of Life treatment\n\nStellantis implements actions from the ecodesign stage to the End-of-Life of its vehicles.\n\nThrough its choice of materials, Stellantis aims to promote the recyclability of its products, to obtain the homologation of its vehicles where regulatory relevant, the success of their sales and their effective recycling at the end of their life.\n\nOne of our actions in this field fall within the framework of European Directive No. 2000/53/EC of September 18, 2000 on end-of-life vehicles (ELV) which sets vehicle design requirements and operational processing requirements for the vehicle at the end of its service life.\n\n- From the design stage, recyclability is taken into account. Stellantis has implemented the processes needed to fulfill the 95% recovery requirement in vehicle weight, and 85% reusing or recycling materials with traceability processes for information on the weight of materials, substances and the corresponding assessments and analyses.\n\nIn accordance with EU Directive 2005/64/CE, audits are conducted by a third-party regarding the traceability processes for information on the weight of materials, substances and the corresponding assessments and analyses.\nAt the end of life, Stellantis implements three types of recovery for end-of-life vehicles: reuse of parts, recycling of materials and energy recovery. Since 2015, vehicles in Europe have to be 95% recoverable and 85% reusable or recyclable.\n\nIn order to meet its obligations, the Company has an internal horizontal network, that provides the framework to manage the upstream and downstream processes. The two activities include: upstream, which seeks eco-design solutions, and downstream, which involves monitoring the collection and treatment of end-of-life vehicles. This work is conducted in close collaboration with Company partners such as suppliers, recycling operators and vehicle manufacturer associations.\n\nAll the Company\u2019s vehicles in Europe are:\n\n- 95% recoverable\n- 85% recyclable\n\n6.1.7.5. Main initiatives to improve responsible End of Life treatment\n\nIn 2000, the EU End-of-Life Vehicle Directive began requiring all vehicle manufacturers and importers to take back vehicles from the last owners or holders when the cars have reached end-of-life. For that purpose and by following the different national requirements, the two former companies (FCA and PSA) have built take-back networks in EU member states where they were operating. The systems vary in different countries between implementation and maintenance by the manufacturers themselves, assigning a service provider on their behalf or participating in a collective take-back process, where required by law.\n\nIn France, we implemented an Individual System, which uses industrial partnerships of a high standard, both technically and financially. They track ELVs and ensure that the overall recovery rate is achieved. At the end of 2021, the Company\u2019s industrial partners were working with networks of 436 certified dismantling companies for former PSA Brands, and 612 for former FCA Brands, with 222 common dismantling companies.\n\nIn Regions outside Europe, the Company is actively analyzing the regional and local market situation as well as ELV-related legislation. The Company adopts and develops strategies and plans for implementation depending on the local and regional requirement and constraints:\n\n- in the U.S., the environmental effects of vehicles at the end-of-life stage are reduced using a market-driven recycling infrastructure, making automobiles and their components among the most recycled consumer products in that country;\n- in Asia, some countries have developed momentum around waste legislation. Stellantis has close cooperation with joint venture partners in China;\n- in India, we have a business partnership to support the development of Waste Law to treat ELVs and High Voltage Batteries;\n- in Africa, Stellantis implemented a study with Morocco\u2019s government to improve the collection and treatment of ELV.\n\nIndividual System to manage End-of-Life Vehicles (ELV)\n\nIn 2021, Stellantis collected and processed with an internal Individual System 34,609 of ELVs in France for former PSA and FCA brands. These accounted for 40,996 tons of material recovered, of which 87% was recycled.\n\nActions Plan to collect and treat abandoned ELVs\n\nStellantis made a major contribution to piloting the action plan for the re-absorption of historic stocks of abandoned ELVs in the French overseas territories in which the French Environmental Code applies (Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Martinique, French Guyana, Reunion Island, Saint Pierre-et-Miquelon Island and Mayotte). This plan, which addresses the environmental and health issues that arise when their last owner abandons vehicles, resulted in the signing of a framework agreement between manufacturers on October 24, 2018. At the end of 2021, this action plan was active in French overseas departments with 21,437 abandoned ELVs collected.\n\nRevenue generation\n\nBy selling reuse parts and recycled materials, ELVs can generate additional revenue for distribution networks. In Europe, the collection and treatment of end-of-life vehicles generated a total revenue of \u20ac2.6 million in 2021, for the sole company-owned network and used vehicle sales branches. The dealer network, promotes circular economy through various offerings: remanufactured parts, \u201cRepair & Return\u201d services in Europe and reused parts from end-of-life vehicles dismantling. In 2021, these business lines generated a total revenue of \u20ac528 million.\n6.1.7.6. Main initiatives to provide customers with offers in the circular economy mindset: verified pre-owned cars, remanufactured parts\n\nAffordable maintenance with replacement parts for all budgets in a circular economy mindset\n\nFor our customers with older vehicles, Stellantis provides a service which offers the Eurorepar range and equipment of manufacturer parts. In addition to offering a full range of remanufactured original parts, Stellantis also offers multi-brand reused parts and a \u201crepair and return\u201d service for automatic gearboxes and complex electronic components. The total range of parts offering covers close to 60% of vehicle content and allows cost savings for customers up to 40% compared to equivalent original new parts.\n\nMopar, Eurorepar, BproAuto and B\u00f6lk brands cover a wide range of parts and service offerings. This range allows Stellantis to meet the parts and service needs, regardless of budget for our customers.\n\nStellantis replacement parts are available for all our markets:\n- original parts: Stellantis original new parts;\n- smart buy: Eurorepar parts, Suppliers\u2019 parts, Remanufactured and \u201crepaired and returned\u201d of Stellantis original parts;\n- best costs: Reused parts, B\u00f6lk parts.\n\nParts and Services Sustainability\n\nStellantis offers a full range of remanufactured parts that support the aftermarket needs of customers. With 75 parts distribution centers, Stellantis Parts and Services is dedicated to delivering the right part at the right time around the globe (for more information refer to section 2.6.3). These parts help to reduce the cost of vehicle ownership, decrease the volume of materials heading to landfills and lower energy consumption. Remanufactured product lines include parts such as starters, alternators, brake calipers, electronic control modules, high-voltage battery packs, torque converters, steering, suspension and engine and transmission product categories.\n\nDepending on the part, the average raw-material usage is reduced between 60% to 95%, while CO\u2082 emissions are reduced between 30% to 50% compared with new part production. Remanufactured offerings cover close to 35% of vehicle parts. The Company certifies the production of remanufactured parts, manufactured internally or through specialized providers, in order to provide a repair solution that is equivalent to original equipment parts and provides the same warranty conditions as new parts.\n\n- Remanufactured Parts: Covering a large scope of mechanical and electronic parts, remanufactured parts allow savings of up to 95% material and 50% of CO\u2082 emissions. In 2021, 64% of engines, 65% of gearboxes, 38% of clutches, 48% of injectors, 60% of alternators and 62% of particulate filters sold by brands in Europe and North America were remanufactured parts. Circular Economy in Europe and in North America generated close to 5% of the turnover of the spare-parts where remanufactured parts exists.\n\n- Reused Parts: Since 2019, former PSA offered a re-use catalog to authorized repairers in France through a partnership. Since 2020 and through the investment in Amanh\u00e3 Global which offers, though an e-commerce platform, re-used parts for customers including B2C and B2B for all Brands. In 2021, this offering was extended to include former FCA networks. In 2021, Stellantis sold more than 86,761 reused parts.\n\n- \u201cRepair & Return\u201d service: extending the lifespan of complex products: Since 2011, some brands including Peugeot, Citroen and DS have been offering a \u201cRepair & Return\u201d service for both automatic gearboxes and complex electronic products:\n  - automatic gearbox, through a network of 16 repair centers around the world;\n  - electronic products, through a European center covering navigation systems, engine and body controllers, clusters for specific brands;\n  - in 2021, this service has been extended to additional brands and repairers. For 2021, Stellantis sold more than 16,800 \u201cRepair & Return\u201d service.\nDeveloping pre-owned vehicles activities\n\n- In 2021 Stellantis continued to develop its Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) policy with the deployment in G10 countries of its Spotcar CPO Program for all mainstream brands and DS certified for its DS premium Brand. Spotcar was also launched in Turkey, and a dedicated program is in preparation for Alfa Romeo brand. A CPO program provides customers a label for pre-owned cars, which are checked, reconditioned, certified and warranted. On Spotcar and DS Certified websites, Stellantis provides product information, pictures and when available videos to make sure customers are fully informed about the car they are looking at.\n\n- Alongside with CPO programs, Stellantis continues to develop customer satisfaction measurement for our pre-owned vehicles customers: already active in France, this program will be activated in all G10 countries in 2022 to ensure our dealers provide to customers the best possible experience, with the same level of attention than towards new cars customers.\n\n- Stellantis also supported the development of multi-brand B2C business Aramis Group, through a successful IPO (Initial Public Offering) on Euronext stock market in June 2021. This allows Aramis Group to sustain its European growth, in France, Spain, Belgium, the UK since early 2021 and potentially in other markets. Aramis Group provides customers with a top level digital experience, proposing affordable refurbished cars of all makes. Aramis Group refurbishment facilities are managed in order to preserve resources (70% of waste generated by refurbishing activities were recycled in 2020) and is committed to further reduce the environmental impact of these activities. Aramis governance is also compliant with market best practices, with independent members of the Board, a balanced gender representation and the creation of dedicated committees of the Board for nominations, compensations and benefits as well as for CSR. The Company is committed to develop and retain talents (70% of the workforce trained in 2020, Great place to work program), to achieve maximum safety at work and to embrace team diversity.\n\nIMPACT MEASUREMENT OF THE ELECTRIFICATION STRATEGY\n\nElectrification is likely to increase the global demand for the materials for the manufacturing of Low-Emission Vehicles (LEVs): mainly cobalt, lithium and nickel. To preserve the natural resources as well as to mitigate the risk of scarcity, Stellantis works to reduce its consumption of materials in LEV manufacturing through the implementation of a full circular economy battery life cycle management starting by extending the lifespan of the battery for automotive usage through repair and remanufacturing, then implementing battery second-life solutions.\n\nIn 2021, 1,723 of the batteries used in Stellantis\u2019 vehicles had a life cycle management solution: 17 were repaired, 516 were remanufactured, 895 were used in 2nd life projects, and 295 were recycled. Stellantis operates through 7 battery repair centers, and a battery expertise center for their remanufacturing. When the batteries are no longer suited for vehicle use, they are reused for energy stationary storage purposes. The company also collaborates with qualified recycling companies, with the objective to recycle with the most efficient process a growing number of batteries in Europe and North America.\n\nThe Company also works to increase battery energy density which would decrease the quantity of raw materials needed per unit of energy. Stellantis conducts research and development activities for solid-state batteries and chemical compositions for other raw materials that are not considered critical. From 2024, Stellantis plans to base its electrification strategy on two battery technologies, both without cobalt (see section 2.5.3.2.4).\n\nTo secure lithium availability, Stellantis signed two memorandums of understanding for new direct offtake with lithium geothermal partners in North America and Europe. The Company\u2019s tier 1 battery suppliers have also contracted lithium suppliers in Europe. For the longer term, Stellantis prepares to set up offtake agreements of recycled raw materials with recyclers.\n6.1.7.7. Specific initiatives related to High-Voltage Batteries (HBV)\n\nWhen HBVs cannot be used in vehicles, Stellantis HBVs can be processed into up to 3 steps:\n\n**Repair and Remanufacturing**\n- Remanufacturing extends the use phase and avoid the premature recycling of High-Voltage Batteries (HVBs).\n- To reinforce the sustainability of its HVBs, for the new generation developed for its brands, Stellantis is expanding a repair and remanufacturing process. If the battery fails, it will either be repaired in the network or sent to a remanufacturing center. The repaired battery will then be reinstalled in the vehicle from which it had been removed whereas the remanufactured one will be used in another used electric vehicle to maintain the electric mobility of the Company\u2019s customers as long as possible.\n\n**Second life**\nStellantis is also working on solutions to reuse HVBs in electric stationary storage facilities such as:\n- A container including eight used batteries, from Company\u2019s vehicles \u201cPeugeot iOn\u201d and \u201cCitro\u00ebn C-Zero\u201d, which was installed in Carri\u00e8res-sous-Poissy in 2018 and connected to the site grid to provide energy services. This container enables us to optimize the energy consumption in buildings by many ways including load shifting, storage of energy during the night and use during the day or balancing services to the grid.\n- To study the ability of next-generation EV batteries to be reused in second life for stationary storage applications, Stellantis is exploring the reuse of these batteries by designing, building and testing electric stationary storage demonstrators in 2021, focused on residential, commercial and industrial use in particular with its Joint Venture with NHOA Free2move e-solutions.\n\nAt the same time, Stellantis is still evaluating partnership opportunities with utility companies in order to design, build and operate a large-scale pilot of an energy stationary storage facility.\n\n---\n\n**Recycling Process**\n\nIn 2015, Peugeot, Citro\u00ebn and DS have signed a contract for the European markets. Our partner obtained the silver medal for its CSR performance awarded in 2019 by the organization EcoVadis.\n\n---\n\n**CIRCULAR ECONOMY OF HIGH-VOLTAGE BATTERIES**\n\n- **Recycling Process**\n  - **Mining**\n  - **Recycling Materials**\n  - **End-of-Life traction batteries**\n  - **Battery Treatment Centre**\n  - **Separation of Materials**\n  - **Excluding electrochemistry (casing, circuit board, screws, etc.)**\n  - **Recycling of Manganese, Cobalt, Nickel, etc.**\n  - **Recycling of plastic, steels, etc.**\n  - **Other uses (e.g., pigments)**\n  - **Smart Grid**\n  - **Energy Storage**\n  - **Mobility**\n  - **Remanufacturing**\n  - **Recycling**\n  - **Existing loop**\n  - **Emerging loop**\n\n---\n\n1 Batteries from hybrid and electric vehicles.\nAt the end of 2020, former PSA extended this partnership to Opel and Vauxhall brands for the new-generation of PHEV and BEV traction batteries. In order to recycle higher battery volumes in Europe and optimize the associated logistics costs, Stellantis selected local recyclers by geographical zones.\n\nThe same process is planned with the former FCA brands, which previously developed local solutions by country.\n\nIn 2020, the partner\u2019s recycling rates were 69.3% for Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) batteries and 83.8% for Nickel Metal Hydride (Ni-MH) batteries. The results for 2021 are not yet available at the time of publication of this report. These rates are significantly higher than the 50% regulatory thresholds for recycling efficiency. This agreement covers the dealership networks and industrial sites for all current Li-ion and Ni-MH batteries across all European marketing countries.\n\nIn terms of battery legislation, the Company is actively involved with this area of expertise via the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association (ACEA). Outside Europe, particularly in China, Stellantis makes an active contribution in partnership with local Joint Ventures.\n\n### 6.1.8 DETAILED KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n#### GRI 301-1\n\n**6.1.8.1 Total weight and percentage of materials purchased for vehicle production by type**\n\n(2021)\n\n| Materials purchased for vehicle production | Weight of materials used (tons) | Materials percentage |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Steel                                      | 8,871,486                       | 77 %                |\n| Light Alloys                               | 949,558                         | 8 %                 |\n| Cast Iron                                  | 62,701                          | 1 %                 |\n| Other Metals                               | 590,403                         | 5 %                 |\n| Elastomer                                  | 303,135                         | 3 %                 |\n| Polymers                                   | 666,468                         | 6 %                 |\n| Fluids                                     | 29,906                          | 0.3 %               |\n| Other                                      | 31                              | \u2014 %                 |\n| **TOTAL**                                  | **11,473,688**                  | **100 %**           |\n\n**6.1.8.2 Availability of solutions to optimize High Voltage Batteries Lifespan and End of Life through Repair, Remanufacturing, 2nd life, Recycling in Europe, North America and China**\n\n(2021)\n\n| Markets          | Repair | Remanufacturing | 2nd life | Recycling |\n|------------------|--------|-----------------|----------|-----------|\n| Europe           | available | available | available | available |\n| North America    | available | available | available | available |\n| China            | available |          |          |           |\n6.2 VEHICLE IMPACT ON AIR QUALITY\n\n6.2.1 CONTEXT AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\nCSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE #15: Vehicle impact on air quality\n\nThe effects of atmospheric pollutants on climate, ecosystems, natural habitats and agriculture as well as human and animal health are a major public concern. Reducing vehicle emissions necessitates substantial research and development investments on technologies by vehicle manufacturers which can have a direct impact on their financial performance and profitability.\n\nGiven the frequent media coverage, such effects reflect an important reputational issue for automobile companies. Air quality and associated public health concerns have resulted in the introduction of local, state/country, and international regulations to control atmospheric pollutant emissions in many areas of the world, including a wide variety of markets into which Stellantis sells its products.\n\nIn addition, there are a growing number of cities that impose traffic restrictions that inhibit certain vehicles\u2019 operation, both by geography and by time of day.\n\nStellantis continues its significant efforts to produce vehicles that comply with regulations and at the same time meet consumer demands, including the growing demands for sustainable mobility. This includes current and near-term plans to increase our portfolio of electrified vehicles. Stellantis is also developing advanced emission control technologies to minimize environmental impact of internal combustion engines. These combined actions support our goal of reducing emissions of our products.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nThe Company is committed continuing its longstanding efforts to reduce the environmental impact from our products, which at a minimum requires us to develop and produce vehicles that meet applicable emission standards worldwide.\n\nStellantis supports efforts to cooperate with the relevant public institutions/governmental agencies in the review and improvement of regulations in order to reflect the improved technology while maintaining a reasonable balance between sound science, availability of technologies, consumer demand, societal benefits, and affordability.\n\nThe Company recognizes the role of public institutions and/or national and local governments supporting a green transition in electrified mobility including the use of incentives to facilitate that transition.\n### 6.2.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\n| CSR ISSUE | VISION / AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | 2021 RESULTS |\n|-----------|-------------------|----------------|------------|--------------|\n| CSR issue #15 | Vehicle impact on air quality | **Meaningfully reduce impact on air quality by focusing on development of a wide range of affordable Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV)** | **Share of ZEV\\(^1\\) in global sales mix (focus on U.S. and EU)** | **EU: 8% of Passenger Cars**<br>**U.S.: n.a.** | |\n| **Owners** | **Chief Engineering Officer** | | | | |\n| | | **Short-term** | **Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan)** | **Long-term** | |\n| | | 2025: | 2030: | 2038: | |\n| | | EU: 34% of Passenger Cars | EU: 100% of Passenger Cars | EU: 100% of Passenger Cars | |\n| | | U.S.: 14% of Passenger Cars + Light Duty Trucks | U.S.: 50% of Passenger Cars + Light Duty Trucks | U.S.: 100% of Passenger Cars + Light Duty Trucks | |\n| | | **Percentage of nameplates with ZEV\\(^1\\) offering (focus on U.S. and EU)** | | | |\n| | | 2025: | 2030: | 2038: | |\n| | | EU: 74% of Passenger Cars | EU: 100% of Passenger Cars | EU: 100% of Passenger Cars | |\n| | | U.S.: 60% of Passenger Cars + Light Duty Trucks | U.S.: 100% of Passenger Cars + Light Duty Trucks | U.S.: 100% of Passenger Cars + Light Duty Trucks | |\n\n\\(^1\\)ZEV = Zero Emission Vehicles (Battery Electric Vehicles)\n6.2.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n6.2.3.1 Risks\n\nGlobal emissions standards continue to become increasingly stringent. Stellantis is aware that there are risks associated with the changing requirements and associated costs related to the product development. Product environmental innovations are essential for the achievement of such standards. These innovations help prevent delayed vehicle launches and the associated financial risks. The annual risk of loss of revenue for a company the size of Stellantis is approximately \u20ac1.5 to \u20ac3.1 billion due to unwanted delayed vehicle launches.\n\nThe U.S. has the most stringent pollutant emission standards. However, with the introduction of the Real Driving Emission (RDE) regulations in Europe and other markets that borrow European Union regulations, the global emissions compliance standards are reducing ever closer to the U.S. standards. A good example is the European Union\u2019s (EU) adoption of Euro 6d, coupled with the expected introduction of Euro 7 standards in 2025. In the U.S., the fleet emissions for light duty vehicles will be required to meet 30 mg/mile of NOx and Non-Methane Organic Gases (NMOG) by 2025. Brazil will launch the PL8 emission standard in 2025. The release of the first draft of China 7 standards is projected in 2023.\n\n| NOx (mg/km) | NMOG (mg/km) | CO (CO) |\n|-------------|--------------|---------|\n| U.S. SULEV 20 | 12 | 622 |\n| U.S. SULEV 30 | 19 | 622 |\n| U.S. ULEV 50 | 31 | 1,057 |\n| EU Euro 7 (CLOVE scenario) | 20 | 25 | 400 |\n| China 6b | 35 | 35 | 500 |\n\n1 SULEV: Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicles\n2 ULEV: Ultra Low Emission Vehicles\n3 Euro 7 data refers to the CLOVE consortium proposal. CLOVE consortium was appointed by the European Commission to deliver an initial proposal to be discussed.\n4 Clove most stringent scenario\n5 Non-Methane Hydrocarbons (NMHC) emissions\n6.2.3.2 Opportunities\n\nAir quality requirements can be seen as both business and reputation opportunities for Stellantis.\n\nStellantis is continuing to improve the Company\u2019s image and the image of the brands by providing vehicles with the advanced technologies that are required in the markets with the most stringent regulations, to other countries and markets.\n\nOpportunities to further develop the business and elevate the company\u2019s image include:\n\n- Increase offerings of battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, as well as improved emissions for internal combustion engine vehicles. For instance, 10 battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are expected to be launched by 2022;\n- Support regulations improvements and incentives for market acceptance of low emission vehicles and vehicles with electrified powertrains. For instance, one vehicle under Euro 3 standards emits the same mass of particulate emissions as 100 vehicles under Euro 5-6;\n- Develop a patent portfolio of technologies;\n- Sell advanced engine technology licenses to competitors.\n\n6.2.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nConsistent with the commitment of and made by our management, Stellantis\u2019s aim is to ensure compliance from technical and legal points of view, both the letter and the spirit of laws, as well for governmental emission certification/issuing of the type approval to allow our vehicles to be sold.\n\nEmployees involved in meeting compliance and regulations of emissions are expected to know and respect not only the requirements imposed by applicable laws and regulations, but also the applicable internal rules and processes we use to help achieve such compliance. To support this, employees have access to processes that use and make available information databases, technical and engineering guidelines, networks of meetings and governance, reference documents, and training materials.\n\nEmission compliance governance is used, in the form of engineering working groups associated with management oversight regional committees, to report emission compliance operation and policy decisions to the Global Technical Safety and Regulatory Compliance Manager and other Senior Management in Engineering, Planning, Legal, and related organizations, regarding tailpipe emissions, CO\u2082 emissions, hybrid and battery-electric vehicles all-electric range, evaporative emissions, and On-Board Diagnostics.\n\nThese regional committees, all structured of the same manner, are autonomous and include core and contributing members, which are independent and cross-functional, and which allow them to make objective and well-researched decisions. Decisions are made by considering regulatory, technical and legal expertise. Some of the activities include review of technical policy, regulatory assumptions, design rules, program approvals, guidance on emission compliance questions and guidelines.\n\n6.2.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nStellantis is focused on making responsible and prudent environmental policy decisions that touch the entire timeline of our vehicles\u2019 timeline, from initial concept to product launch, as well as the \u201cin-use\u201d phase, when our products are in the hands of our customers. Vehicles may only be marketed if compliant with regulations. Refer to section 2.5.1 for Stellantis electrification policy.\n6.2.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nStellantis continuously makes R&D investments to the improvement of vehicle tailpipe emissions quality and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. These investments have led to worldwide development of technical solutions (electrification...) to improve reduction of fossil fuel consumption and pollutant emissions.\n\nTo develop new technologies we adopted the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) process. This methodology provides a consistent and uniform assessment process to grade the technical maturity of different technologies. The levels of technical maturity are aligned with the Global Product Development Plan and maturity gate levels are achieved based on stakeholder reviews.\n\n6.2.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\n6.2.7.1 Improve air quality by reducing vehicle emissions\n\nTo minimize particulate matter emissions, both in particle numbers and mass, optimized engine measures and the use of wall flow particulate filters are effective technologies. Particulate filters allow the screening of both fine and ultra-fine particulate matter. Depending on the fuel the result can achieve up to 99.7% by number and up to more than 95%\\(^1\\) by mass. The particular filter is an effective mechanical system which is fully operational throughout the phases of engine operation and driving conditions.\n\nWith the introduction of the particulate filter in the late 1990s, particulate emissions plummeted from more than 3,500,000 particulates per cm\\(^3\\) in an unfiltered Internal Combustion Engine to less than 3,500 particulates per cm\\(^3\\) in an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) with a particulate filter.\n\n---\n\n**COMPARISON OF PARTICULATE EMISSIONS LEVELS OF AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE FITTED WITH A PARTICULATE FILTER**\n\n| Clean (mountain) air | Air from an ICE fitted with a particulate filter | Clean-room air | Air near a busy road | Cigarette smoke | Air in traffic | \u201cDirty\u201d industrial site |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------|----------------|---------------|------------------------|\n| < 1,500              | < 3,500                                       | 4,000          | from 10,000 to 40,000| from 50,000 to 60,000| from 100,000 to 1,000,000 |\n\nNumber of particles per cm\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\)Source: French Agency for the Environment and Energy Management (ADEME): particulate and NOx emissions by road vehicles \u2013 May 2018\nIn 2021, 73.3% of ICE Passenger Cars were sold with technology for particulate emissions to reach values lower than 1.9 mg per km (or 3 mg per mile) for both spark ignition and compression engines.\n\nWe have developed and continue to improve the technology for a high performing filter for spark ignition engines to further reduce ultrafine particles from gasoline engines. The technology development will take into account the new constraints resulting from powertrain electrification. This new filter technology is expected to be launched in 2022.\n\nAlso, Nitrogen Oxides (NO\\textsubscript{x}) emissions are minimized adopting different technologies for ICE: Three Way Catalyst and Selective Catalyst Reduction are the main technologies for vehicle applications around the world.\n\nTo reduce vapor emissions from fuel systems, also known as Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and to fulfil more stringent regulations in main markets such as EU, China and U.S., Stellantis continuously seeks to improve technology for our evaporative emission control system.\n\nBecause compliance with emission requirements in all global markets is our primary goal, we continue to engineer and implement improved and newly-developed advanced emission control technologies in order to achieve that in markets with the most stringent emission regulations, such as the U.S. and Europe. Moreover, we anticipate this can confer additional clean air benefits in other markets in which such improved and advanced technologies may be deployed as well.\n\n6.2.7.2 Partnering transparency\n\nPeugeot, Citroen and DS Automobile brands of Stellantis have taken an innovative approach to customer transparency by publishing its vehicles\u2019 real (on the road) fuel consumption. Measurements are taken in accordance with a specific test protocol audited by an internationally renowned independent organization. The measurement protocol developed has proven to be extremely reliable for testing real-world fuel consumption and CO\\textsubscript{2} emissions (for more information refer to section 2.5.3). The experiment methodology was reproduced and also used to measure NO\\textsubscript{x} and particulate emissions, as well. Since 2018 Peugeot, Citroen and DS brands publish the results of these tests to contribute to further increasing the reliability of automotive tests and measurements.\n\nTo date, Peugeot, Citroen and DS Automobile brands of Stellantis are among the few car manufacturers to have made such a commitment of transparency to benefit towards its customers.\n\n6.3 INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT\n\nStellantis\u2019s environmental stewardship endeavors to achieve the objective of reducing our environmental footprint and to contribute to the Company\u2019s financial success by reducing production costs. Through the adoption of a lean, smart and increasingly digital operating model, a commitment to sustainable innovation, and the direct participation of employees in the pursuit of excellence, we achieve consistent improvements in environmental performance at our manufacturing operations.\n\n6.3.1 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nAs outlined in section 1.3.2 of this report, the function of the ESG Committee is to assist and advise the Board of Directors and act under authority delegated by the Board of Directors with respect to monitoring, evaluation and reporting on the sustainable policies and practices, management standards, strategy, performance and governance.\n\nAccountable members of the Top Executive Team are supporting the CSR commitments. The Executive Vice-President (EVP) Manufacturing is responsible for:\n\n- industrial and sites carbon footprint (see section 2.6);\n- optimization of material cycles in manufacturing processes (including waste) (see section 6.4);\n- control of industrial discharges and nuisances (see section 6.5);\n- sustainable water management (see section 6.6);\n- protection of biodiversity (see section 6.7).\nIn this role, the EVP Manufacturing validates the CSR vision, ambitions and targets for these CSR issues and is responsible for their achievement. To ensure Stellantis is working towards these ambitions, we monitor our performance against CSR targets using global KPIs.\n\nAlthough our Manufacturing facilities are mainly contributing to the CSR performance, our CSR scope comprises additional Research and Development facilities including proving grounds, Offices, IT / Warehouse / Logistics centers and Retail facilities that based on their sizes and operations are considered to have an environmental impact. Therefore, the EVP Manufacturing liaises with EVP Research and Development, EVP Sales/Marketing and EVP HR & Transformation on the environmental performance of these areas.\n\nCSR performance is reviewed on a regularly basis and appropriate actions decided with regional leadership. The EVP of the Regions together with the Manufacturing officers are responsible to develop their plans and implement actions to meet the CSR targets. On an annual basis, the Plant Managers of our production facilities are preparing site-specific plans including targets, actions and necessary investments to meet our environmental commitments. They are responsible for the environmental performance of their plant.\n\nIn our manufacturing facilities, we have dedicated environmental specialists. These specialists are supported by a network of nominated environmental representatives from various business functions. They are responsible to help ensure compliance with applicable regulation; for implementing the environmental policy and this includes managing the Environmental Management System (EMS) in compliance with ISO 14001 standard. They are responsible for supporting the CSR activities at facility level.\n\nThe Environmental Central Department (ECD) helps facilities with legal compliance and supports the local EMS by developing efficiencies and common standards. The ECD oversees and manages the quality of the EMS through audits and status reviews. ECD conduct strategic cross functional planning for reducing the environmental impact. ECD evaluates and shares best practices with the plants to encourage continuous improvement.\n\nContinuous improvement of our environmental performance is an essential element of our policy and a common key task for sites and central functions. Environmental performance is fully integrated into the Lean Manufacturing System of Stellantis and tracked with the main Manufacturing KPIs by a standardized score card process. Monthly leadership performance status reviews on a local and corporate level helps effectiveness of implemented measures and improves the environmental footprint according to the strategic plan.\n\n6.3.2 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\n6.3.2.1 Environmental and Energy Policy\n\nIn 2021, we started developing a corporate Environmental and Energy Policy. The policy will include our commitment to comply with applicable environmental regulations, to continual improvement, and will outline how we intend to protect the environment by providing guidelines for our operations and employees. Environmental protection and energy performance are important company objectives and affect our business activities therefore input to the policy is required from many divisions. This process is ongoing and is projected to be completed by mid-2022.\n\n6.3.2.2 An active ISO 14001 certification policy\n\nAn important Company commitment is to implement environmental management systems. The systems meet the international standard ISO 14001, a recognized standard for management and organization. By using this approach, we have implemented a common environmental strategy to identify the material environmental aspects of each site, reduce the environmental impact, draft procedures and standards, drive regulatory compliance and strive for continual improvement \u2013 the foundation of our environmental protection.\n\nAn environmental management system is in place at 93% of our production facilities. In 1995, Ellesmere Port, UK, was the first manufacturing plant to be certified. In addition to the production facilities, 3 Research and Development (Engineering) centers and 26 spare part warehouses globally have ISO 14001 certified environmental management system implemented.\n6.3.3 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\n6.3.3.1 Managing Environmental Compliance and performance - with the Stellantis Production Way (SPW)\n\nSPW is our manufacturing system that applies to our manufacturing processes and facilities. The system includes references to standardized tools, guidance documents and processes, which translate abstract requirements into tangible actions for production. SPW consists of 2-managerial and 10-technical domains, one of which is environment. At the heart of the environment domain our master fundamental \u201cManaging Environmental Compliance and Performance\u201d provides the framework for our mission to:\n\n- comply with laws and regulations;\n- achieve environmental performance though continual improvement;\n- maintain an environmental management system;\n- minimize use of energy and raw materials, strive for zero waste, zero emissions and zero water withdrawal for industrial activities, reduce GHG emissions;\n- enhance biodiversity and preserve natural habitats;\n- encourage engagement and motivation of employees;\n- be a green \u201cneighbor\u201d in the community.\n\nThe following list shows some of the benefits of applying the SPW environment domain into our production processes:\n\n- promotes visibility for environmental management responsibilities and tasks;\n- fosters understanding of environmental matters;\n- increases efficiency and reduces costs due to standardized processes and tools;\n- improves and aligns quality of environmental management;\n- integrates 17-ISO 14001 standard elements following the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle;\n- links with compliance management and oversight.\n\nAs part of SPW, we use global Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) \u2013 consolidated in the Green Factory KPI - to track plants\u2019 environmental performance against the targets. Tracking the Green Factory KPI, along with the exchange of best practices between production facilities, drives the overall improvement of the Company\u2019s environmental performance based on the best performing facility.\n\n6.3.3.2 Environmental resources\n\nStellantis operations aim to achieve compliance with local regulations, and beyond compliance we seek to safeguard the surrounding environment and the quality of life in our host communities. To meet our objectives, we identify the role of the environmental specialist as a key function that requires specific competence and training. We are updating standard job descriptions for our environmental experts that outline the technical and social skills required. We are reviewing training programs, materials and formats to prepare environmental training for all job levels. We are establishing a standardized regionally flexible model. Training courses will include face-to-face sessions, experience sharing opportunities and e-learning. Courses and training session attendance and requirements will be tracked.\n\n6.4 OPTIMIZATION OF MATERIAL CYCLES IN MANUFACTURING PROCESSES (INCLUDING WASTE)\n\n6.4.1 CONTEXT AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\nCSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE #16: Optimization of material cycles in manufacturing processes (including waste)\n\nStellantis continues its development of a circular economy and industrial processes that allow us to reduce the usage of raw materials (for more information, see also section 6.1.1). This also includes material reuse, recovery and recycling. The processes are intended to avoid wasting natural resources and using only the quantity of raw materials necessary. By encouraging the use of recovery and recycling opportunities, this strategy also extends into waste management, striving for minimal environmental impact and our goal of zero waste to landfill.\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nStellantis stands by the waste management goals defined by Global Compact. Additionally, as part of the ISO 14001 certification obtained by most of our plants, we develop and implement consistent improvements in environmental areas, including waste management. Stellantis strives to recycle what cannot be reused. If neither reuse nor recovery is possible, waste is disposed according to applicable law with the aim of impacting the environment as little as possible.\n\n6.4.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\n| CSR ISSUE | VISION / AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | 2021 RESULTS |\n|-----------|-------------------|----------------|------------|--------------|\n| CSR issue #16 Optimization of material cycles in manufacturing processes (including waste) | Design industrial processes that allow minimal use of raw materials and ensure 100% waste recycling in local loops of circular economy. | Total waste normalized (kg/vehicle produced) | Short-term: 2025: 40 kg/vehicle produced | 48.15 kg/vehicle produced |\n| | | | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan): 2030: 36 kg/vehicle produced | |\n| | | | Long-term: 2050: 22.5 kg/vehicle produced | |\n| | | Percentage of waste recovered out of total waste generated | 2025: 84% | 80% |\n| | | | 2030: 90% | |\n| | | | 2050: 100% | |\n| | | Percentage of plants with zero waste sent to landfill | 2025: 65% | 61% |\n| | | | 2030: 75% | |\n| | | | 2050: 100% | |\n\n1 The difference compared with information included in the \u201cNon-financial information\u201d section of the 2021 Annual Report is 13,983 tons of total waste, as this amount of demolition waste was not deducted (contrary to the defined reporting rules).\n6.4.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nGRI 102-15  GRI 103-2  GRI 306-1\n\n6.4.3.1 Risks\n\nStellantis identified some risks and has implemented several actions and initiatives to mitigate them.\n\n- Potential business risk:\n  - dependency from raw materials constraints and increasing supply cost due to material scarcity;\n  - packaging material represents approximately 50% of waste generated at our production facilities. Global sourcing due to cost pressure, favors the usage of one-way packaging that ends-up as waste at our plants;\n  - Stellantis has responsibility for hazardous and non-hazardous waste through final disposal of waste. Third-party service providers such as waste contractors or waste treatment and disposal facilities that fail to comply with transport or other waste regulations may cause fines or legal prosecution for Stellantis.\n\n- Potential operational risk:\n  - emerging contaminants, e.g., Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP), may limit recycling options and therefore limit our disposal methods;\n  - more stringent regulations, including concentration limits, quotas, and bans, may force us to use expensive treatment methods or increase waste segregation costs;\n  - lack of local waste treatment facilities may lead to waste being shipped long distances at higher costs and an increased dependency on service providers;\n  - landfills located close to production facilities compete economically with waste recovery facilities located in greater distances. Unfavorable business cases may limit our plants\u2019 achieving or maintaining zero waste to landfill status.\n\n- Potential reputation risk:\n  - Stellantis being held responsible for failures of third-party waste service providers that violate contractual obligations for example by illegally dumping waste. Even if Stellantis fulfilled all its obligations, this may lead to media attention resulting in impact to brand value, customer defection and legal prosecution;\n  - Stellantis being held responsible for increasing pollution to the environment by continuing landfilling instead of using recovery. This may result in impact to brand value, customer defection and loss of profit.\n\n6.4.3.2 Opportunities\n\nGRI 306-2\n\nStellantis identified opportunities and has implemented several actions to seize them.\n\n- Opportunities for the business:\n  - shifting the focus from waste management to resource management. This offers the opportunity to view waste materials as secondary raw material and unlock their value by transforming costs into revenue. Best practice sharing may help identify other industries interested in using these secondary raw materials;\n  - to standardize waste contracts that include flexibility to react on fluctuating costs or volumes and require key performance improvement indicators for service providers to support our targets of: waste reduction, increased recovery rate and zero waste to landfill;\n  - base decisions based on a full cycle cost view for packaging materials that includes purchasing to waste disposal;\n  - to reduce waste handling costs and improve recyclability, set standards for packaging materials that avoid composite materials and favor materials that are easy to separate. Reduce complexity and variety of materials used to have less waste fractions but higher volumes, which may lead to better disposal prices or even revenues.\nOpportunity for operational management:\n- set standards for contractor management and auditing of waste service providers to control risks related to compliance failures;\n- make use of new ideas and technologies for instance working with start-ups to improve the quality of waste sorting, optimizing flows or identifying options for reuse or usage as secondary raw material. This may lead to establishing local circular material loops;\n- minimize usage of hazardous substances to decrease hazardous waste which reduces the costs of waste treatment and disposal;\n- identify opportunities to reuse waste as secondary raw material on-site or with external partners.\n\nOpportunities for reputation:\n- become industry leader in circular economy reducing the impact for the environment and improve brand image and sales;\n- reaching 100% waste recovery represents a sustainable waste management practice and supports the reputation of the Company.\n\n6.4.4 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nOur waste management processes seek to avoid and reduce the generation of waste in our operational processes. If we cannot avoid waste being generated, we preferentially attempt to recover material rather than dispose waste in landfills, which may have a long-term negative impact on the environment. Like other industries, vehicle manufacturing generates waste that needs to be managed and preferably recovered in local loops to reduce the need for raw materials.\n\n6.4.4.1 Main achievements on waste management\n\nIn 2021, we generated in total 305,468 tons of waste, of which 273,850 tons were generated at Manufacturing sites and 31,618 tons from Retail activities.\n\n| Type in % and tons | Total waste by disposal |\n|--------------------|-------------------------|\n| 2% INCINERATION    | 7,310 tons              |\n| 12% LANDFILLING    | 37,198 tons             |\n| 14% ENERGY RECOVERY| 42,215 tons             |\n| 4% OTHER TREATMENT | 12,089 tons             |\n| 68% RECYCLING      | 206,656 tons            |\n\nTotal waste generated includes only material that we discard resulting from our operations. Therefore, we exclude waste generated in demolishing, building or remediation activities, which are not part of our operations. In 2021, waste generated from such projects added up to 38,157 tons in total. In addition, we exclude metal waste and some wastes that are specific for foundries to enable better comparison of data with other automobile manufacturers. In 2021, the total amount of metal waste summed up to 1,053,388 tons, of which 100% were recycled. The excluded waste types coming from our foundries added up to 174,474 tons in total and consisted predominately of foundry sands, the majority of which are regenerated or reused on site.\n\nIn 2021, we generated 63,693 tons of hazardous waste, which represents 21% of total waste generated. The Manufacturing activities generated 96% of the hazardous waste and Retail activities 4%.\nFor our Manufacturing activities, in 2021, the normalized total waste generated was 48.15 kg/vehicle produced, while the normalized hazardous waste was 10.80 kg/vehicle produced. Although multiple factors such as production volume and the usage or avoidance of one-way packaging are significantly influencing waste performance of a production facility, we compare our production plants to identify the best performers and share their best practices.\n\nThe best performing vehicle assembly plant was Brampton Assembly Plant with 13.52 kg waste per vehicle produced. Additional 42% of our vehicle assembly plants performed better than our medium-term target of 36 kg waste per vehicle produced.\n\nIn 2021, we landfilled 37,198 tons of waste, which represents only 12% of our total waste generated. 61% of all the active plants, qualified as zero waste to landfill facilities, which means that no waste was landfilled (except for any waste required to be landfilled due to applicable legislation).\n\nWaste sent to landfill out of total waste\n\nIf waste is disposed in a landfill, that waste is not available as secondary raw material; for those reasons landfilling contradicts our waste disposal commitments. In some jurisdictions, however, local law requires us to landfill our waste.\n\nThe waste streams with the biggest volumes generated at the Manufacturing facilities consists of the following:\n\n- packing waste (wood, cardboard and plastics);\n- paint operations waste (paint sludge, purge solvents);\n- municipal waste;\n- waste water treatment system waste (sludge, oil or water emulsions).\n\nWaste derived from office activities consists of municipal waste. Depending on the specific retail activity, the waste generated is:\n\n- warehouse packaging waste;\n- solid waste from offices and;\n- oil and lubricant waste from dealerships with workshops and maintenance activities.\n6.4.4.2 Main initiatives on waste management\n\nAs outlined in section 6.4.3, the challenges impacting waste generation may require strategic decisions by Global Purchasing and Supply Chain or Engineering, and other risks may be addressed by operational measures. We apply our best practice in the support of our facilities\u2019 waste avoidance, reduction, recycling, reuse, or finding more environmentally friendly disposal methods. Some examples of successful initiatives to reduce waste generation or improve recovery are listed below.\n\n6.4.4.2.1 Initiatives to increase waste reduction and avoidance\n\n- **Packaging waste reduction**: packaging materials play an important role in waste generation and represent roughly 50% of the total waste generated. The main waste streams are wood, cardboard, plastics and mixed fractions. Reducing the generation of packaging waste requires cross-functional efforts by multiple functions such as supply chain, purchasing and quality and manufacturing. New vehicle projects require early planning for the packaging materials. The planning includes determining where the materials come from and which materials should be used in order to limit and control waste generated at plants. To support decisions, a series of workshops were conducted by central functions and environmental engineers from some European production sites. A list was generated that includes preferred packaging materials and ones we recommend that we avoid. Additional value was created by generating less waste streams with higher volumes that have a positive impact on recycling options and prices. This list of materials was incorporated into the standard packaging specifications used by Global Purchasing and Supply Chain in their procurement processes. As a next step, we plan to share and to further improve the specifications with additional knowledge and best practices coming from other regions globally.\n\n- **Reuse of industrial assets**: in our global manufacturing facilities we reuse industrial assets such as machining and production equipment to avoid waste and use resources in a sustainable way. To enable reuse, we adapted equipment for different process needs, transferred them to other Stellantis facilities or sold them to other companies. In 2021, we transferred more than 5,500 assets globally, by these practices.\n\n- **Waste generation avoidance**: at our Kokomo Transmission and Kokomo Casting Plants (U.S.), we eliminated disposable mop heads with launderable ones for cleaning plant wide. This change saved approximately 54 tons of waste per year. We reduced approximately 12 tons of machining process coolant filter waste by changing our mist collectors\u2019 filter material to a coalescing foam; this extended the life of the filter from one to three months, thereby reducing the number of filters purchased, oil loss on filters, waste generated, and the labor to change out filters.\n\n- **From single use to reusable tanks**: choosing the right containers for liquids such as brake fluids or bumper primer that are used in our manufacturing processes can help to reduce or avoid waste being generated. At our plants in Melfi and Cassino (Italy), we changed from receiving these liquids in drums to tanks that are refilled, reducing waste by approximately 30 tons annually.\n\n- **Increasing reuse**: at our vehicle assembly plant Ellesmere Port (UK), and our component production and warehouse facility in Vesoul (France), we identified third parties that can reuse wooden one-way pallets that we previously disposed of as waste. This is a step on our way toward circular material loops and a reduction of approximately 92 tons and 72 tons of waste annually, respectively.\n\n6.4.4.2.2 Initiatives to improve waste recovery:\n\n- **Improving waste segregation and recovery**: at our vehicle assembly plant in Goiana (Brazil), we reorganized and optimized our waste collection infrastructure. We arranged the collection bins based on the location of workstations and types of waste generated. These changes led to better waste segregation and a reduction of approximately 20% non-recyclable waste. We established a waste segregation verification process at some locations to improve the quality of waste separation practices by using an online form to identify locations that require improvement actions such as awareness training or waste collection modifications.\n### 6.4.5 Detailed Key Performance Indicators\n\n**GRI 103-3**  \n**GRI 306-3**  \n**GRI 306-4**  \n**GRI 306-5**\n\n#### 6.4.5.1 Total waste generated from operation by disposal type  \n(in tons)\n\n| Waste generated in 2021 | Recovered recycled | Recovered energy recovered | Incinerated (w/o energy recovery) | Landfilled (disposal other than recovery, incineration, landfilled) | Treated | Total Waste Generated |\n|-------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------------------|\n| **Manufacturing**       |                    |                           |                                  |                                                               |        |                       |\n| Enlarged Europe         | 107,559            | 17,964                    | 6,779                            | 4,851                                                         | 11,153 | 148,306               |\n| North America           | 37,710             | 4,327                     | 124                              | 27,427                                                        | 422    | 70,010                |\n| South America           | 30,775             | 15,639                    | 385                              | 2,032                                                         | 131    | 48,962                |\n| Middle East & Africa    | 2,788              | 880                       | -                                | 540                                                           | -      | 4,209                 |\n| China and India & Asia  | 1,993              | 97                        | 22                               | 251                                                           | -      | 2,363                 |\n| Pacific                 |                    |                           |                                  |                                                               |        |                       |\n| **Total Manufacturing** | 180,825            | 38,907                    | 7,310                            | 35,101                                                        | 11,706 | 273,850               |\n| **Retail**              | 25,831             | 3,308                     | 0                                | 2,097                                                         | 383    | 31,618                |\n| **TOTAL**               | 206,656            | 42,215                    | 7,310                            | 37,198                                                        | 12,089 | 305,468               |\n\n1.

In particular, we monitor and control air emissions such as Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), that are derived from solvent use in paint processes, Sulfur Dioxide (SO\u2082), Nitrogen Oxides (NO\u2093) and Particulate Matter, that are the result of combustion processes (for example, burning fossil fuels for energy generation or heating purposes) and Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) that leaked from refrigeration and air conditioning equipment in our plants and offices. Nuisances could also occur in the form of noise or odor generated by industrial processes or accidental releases of chemicals with potential impact on other environmental media such as soil or water, or on human health.\n\nWe are implementing processes to limit and reduce air emissions, including cleaner painting processes, the post-processing of residual emissions, noise and odor level monitoring and substitution of hazardous substances with non-hazardous ones where possible.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nWe are committed to compliance with environmental regulations in the areas that we operate. Stellantis is developing and implementing processes for consistent improvement and for controlling its environmental impact. Stellantis strives for zero VOC emissions through improvements of treatment processes.\n6.5.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\n| CSR ISSUE | VISION / AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | 2021 RESULTS |\n|-----------|-------------------|----------------|------------|--------------|\n| CSR issue #17 | Control of industrial discharges and nuisances | Implement state of the art technical solutions to prevent industrial activities from causing nuisances to the surrounding areas. | Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions from paint shops normalized (g/m\u00b2 painted). | Short-term: 25 g/m\u00b2 painted | 2025: 25 g/m\u00b2 painted | 2030: 25 g/m\u00b2 painted | 2050: ambition of 0 g/m\u00b2 painted | 24.95 g/m\u00b2 painted |\n\n6.5.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n6.5.3.1 Risks\n\nStellantis identified some risks and has implemented several actions and initiatives to mitigate them.\n\n- Potential business risks:\n  - Stellantis is dependent on future technologies to accomplish the aspirational goal of zero VOC emissions in painting processes;\n  - today, 35% of our paint shops use solvent-based paints and are subject to stringent regulatory emission limits. High production volumes allocated to these plants increase our global VOC emissions. To convert existing solvent-based paint into water-based paint, we estimated an investment cost of several hundred million euros;\n  - increasing demands by authorities for provisions and guarantees to cover clean-up costs of end-of-life real estate assets. Higher premiums to cover the insurance costs of accidental spills and releases.\n\n- Potential operational risks:\n  - meeting more stringent regulatory emission factors could require adapting operational processes or replacing materials;\n\u2022 reducing VOC emissions by combustion, determines increased exhaust gases and energy usage. Such combustion processes negatively contribute to CO\u2082 emissions and also increases NO\u2093 emissions;\n\u2022 new residential development surrounding our facilities may be impacted by noise, light or other emissions.\n\nPotential reputational risks:\n\u2022 failure to meet customer expectations of minimal effect on the environment from our products and production;\n\u2022 accidental releases may cause significant legal and clean-up costs, loss of trust by neighboring communities, damage to company reputation, brand image and sales.\n\n6.5.3.2 Opportunities\nStellantis identified opportunities and has implemented several actions to seize them.\n\nOpportunities for the business:\n\u2022 opportunities to work with suppliers to develop and test new painting methods and equipment, such as low overspray technology;\n\u2022 minimize the risk for accidental releases by implementing pollution control measures such as an equipment maintenance and repair program, enhancing operational procedures in our environmental management systems.\n\nOpportunities for operational management:\n\u2022 implement efficiency measures and process optimization including improved cleaning processes and batch painting which reduce usage of solvents and produce less emission;\n\u2022 reduction of solvent emissions by using solvent-free or low solvents;\n\u2022 replace manual painting operations with automatic painting processes, which use less paint and generate less overspray, thereby reducing VOC emissions and paint sludge;\n\u2022 limit the nuisances to people and the environment by managing the chemicals used on site e.g., ban of substances that causes odor nuisances.\n\nOpportunities for reputation:\n\u2022 enhance relationships, social acceptance to operate and brand value by maintaining or improving air and soil quality and reducing noise and odor in the neighboring communities;\n\u2022 demonstrate transparency by disclosing information to authorities and to the public in case of accidental harmful releases in the environment.\n\n6.5.4 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\n6.5.4.1. Reducing air emissions\n\nBesides industrial carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) emissions (for more information, see section 2.6), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), Sulfur Oxides (SOx), Nitrogen Oxides (NO\u2093), Particulate Matter (PM), and Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) are air emissions generated by Stellantis facilities. These emissions result from the usage of chemical products in painting operations, surface treatment activities, foundry processes, dust collectors, and from burning fossil fuels in heating and VOC abatement processes.\n\nReducing Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions\n\nVOCs require environmental controls to reduce the affect on air quality. Some VOCs are harmful to human beings and the environment, some come from natural sources and others are human-made. In most jurisdictions, regulations are in place to limit and control industrial VOC emissions.\n\nThe majority of VOC emissions generated in our manufacturing operations come from vehicle painting operations or surface treatment processes. VOCs are significant constituents in the formulation of paints and cleaning materials used in paint shops. Even though paint shops using waterborne base coats contribute to our VOC emissions, paint shops with solvent-based base coats play the most important role. Approximately, 35% of our paint shops use solvent-based base coats. When high production volumes are allocated to these plants, they become main drivers for our global VOC emissions.\nIn 2021, we emitted 24.95 g/m\u00b2 painted surface or 2.82 kg/vehicle produced. The best performing vehicle assembly plant was Windsor Assembly Plant with 4.57 g/m\u00b2.\n\nHowever, additional 53% of our vehicle assembly plants performed better than our medium-term target of 25 g/m\u00b2.\n\n**OUR EFFORTS TO REDUCE VOC EMISSIONS**\n\nWe focus our actions on reducing VOC emissions, efficiency measures, reducing consumption of paints and their solvent content, implementing low-emission technologies and installing air treatment equipment for incinerating VOC. Measures for recycling and reuse of solvents for cleaning purposes are ongoing.\n\nThe following selected examples illustrate our efforts to reduce VOC emissions:\n\n- in the paint shops at our vehicle assembly plants in Zaragoza and Madrid (Spain), clear coat lines and base coat lines were retrofitted to replace manual interior painting with robotic applicators. This automated process reduces VOC emissions by up to 2 g/m\u00b2 in Zaragoza and by up to 3.2 g/m\u00b2 in Madrid;\nin our vehicle assembly plant in Hordain (France), we overhauled VOC abatement equipment including zeolite wheel concentrators to achieve the manufacturer\u2019s designed VOC destruction efficiency. This measure reduces VOC emissions up to 4 g/m\u00b2.\n\nour Torino Mirafiori (Italy) plant applies a system of selective permeation, where the nitrogen contained in the compressed air, once heated, is used as a booster fluid in the application of paint products. The advantage of using nitrogen is realized by a more efficient application rate due to the ionization of the fluid, with a consequent reduction in paint overspray. The investment amounted to around \u20ac250,000 to equip 8 spraying robots and reduces the VOC emissions by up to 0.5 g/m\u00b2.\n\nStellantis invests in research and development for new paints and paint technologies. Progress has been made to increase the solid content of the white paint on commercial vehicles, which allows the reduction of the amount of solvent and decreases VOC emissions.\n\nReducing emissions of Sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082), Nitrogen oxides (NO\u2093) and Particulate Matter (PM)\n\nBoth gases, SO\u2082 and NO\u2093, are present in our atmosphere and have natural and industrial origins. Human-made sources are any kind of combustion process, e.g., burning of fossil fuels. The gases can form acid rain, which negatively affects ecosystems such as, forests and lakes, as well as man-made structures like buildings and statues. Therefore, industrial SO\u2082 and NO\u2093 emissions are regulated in most jurisdictions.\n\nParticulate Matter (PM) is solid or liquid particles that is measured in micrometers (1,000 times smaller than millimeter) and suspended into the air. PM may come from natural or human-made sources. PM can cause harm to human health, and the suspended particles can affect the amount of incoming and reflected radiation in the earth\u2019s atmosphere and therefore influence our climate.\n\nIn our Manufacturing facilities, we operate different types of combustion installations using fossil fuels, such as ovens for drying painted parts, thermal oxidizers for reducing VOC emissions, boilers for heating buildings, and cogeneration plants for heat and electricity generation. In our Retail activities these emissions are linked with heating or air conditioning.\n\nIn 2021, our SO\u2082 emissions were in total at 110 tons, NO\u2093 emissions were at 1,463 tons and PM at 115 tons.\n\nWe control our emissions through efficiency and modernization of equipment and communicate transparently.\n\nduring the air emission permitting process for the Detroit Assembly Complex Mack (U.S.), concerned citizens commented that there were no existing State of Michigan air monitoring stations in the immediate vicinity of the plant. As a result, and even though not required by law, Stellantis installed a new ambient air monitoring station to provide local air quality data. Air monitoring began in November 2020 with data reported quarterly to the State of Michigan\u2019s environmental agency, which makes it publicly available on the agency\u2019s website. Data collected through 2021 indicates that the air quality in the vicinity of the plant is consistent with, or better than, the air quality at locations being monitored elsewhere in the City and is below the applicable National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).\n\nReducing Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) emissions\n\nOzone Depleting Substances (ODS) are a group of chemical substances that have the ability to react with ozone and negatively impact the ozone layer of the stratosphere. The ozone layer prevents harmful wavelengths of ultraviolet light to reach the earth\u2019s surface which cause harm to human beings, vegetation and animals. Since the Montreal Protocol in 1987 and the subsequent revisions of this international treaty, production of certain groups of ODS have been banned, and their usage was phased-out or will phase-out within the next few years.\n\nMost ODS are used as refrigerants, solvents or blowing agents which makes them available in process and air conditioning equipment at our manufacturing facilities, offices and retail sites, as well as in the air conditioning systems in our products. Stellantis monitors ODS emissions during ODS-containing equipment maintenance or service activities and leak checks. ODS emissions are recorded in the event of an incident of an equipment installation. In 2021, our ODS emissions were in total at 39 kg of CFC-11 equivalent.\n\n6.5.4.2. Reducing other industrial discharges and nuisances\n\nReducing chemicals\n\nStellantis strives to manage the usage of hazardous chemicals in a rigorous manner. When a new chemical product is introduced at a plant, it is assessed. The assessment includes checking the nature and acceptability of the health and environmental impacts. This assessment either results in a ban of the product or acceptance for use with risk prevention requirements. Safety data sheets are developed for authorized products and access to the information is provided to employees.\nIn addition to the approval processes, structural measures such as building retention basins or using above ground pipe systems versus underground piping to carry liquids, can limit the impact in case of accidental releases. To minimize chemical risks, supervisors or other functions conduct checks of environmental procedures and installations during site walks and inspections as part of Stellantis Production System or during ISO 14001 audits. In addition, inventories of chemical products in stock enables the facility to limit on-site volumes.\n\nReducing other forms of nuisances in local communities, as noise or odor\n\nNoise and odor caused by our operations may cause nuisances to our neighbors including residential areas located close to our facilities. We seek to address the potential risks by conducting impact studies and action plans potentially associated with our manufacturing facilities. The studies assess the sensitivity of residential areas surrounding the plants with criteria such as sound levels, odors or traffic. When new chemical products are introduced at a plant, the components are reviewed to limit issues such as odor. In most jurisdictions, studies are required for new facilities or as part of major site redevelopment and building projects. Usually, these studies are subject to public disclosure and approval by the authorities.\n\nAvoiding and remediating soil contamination\n\nGiven the long history of some industrial facilities, soil impacts may be present at our sites. Historic contamination may be caused by leakages from underground storage tanks, underground pipes or spills. We conduct site investigations as part of ongoing initiatives, site acquisition or divestment projects, and at the request of regulators. The initial site investigation step usually includes record reviews and interviews to identify potential areas of concern. In the following steps, if necessary, onsite investigations may include the analysis of soil, surface water or groundwater, or soil gas samples in order to determine the presence and extent of potential contamination. In some cases, this onsite investigation may consist of several phases to delineate the extent of the contamination. Depending on the results, measures such as monitoring, containment or remediation activities are implemented. Our environmental experts liaise closely with the involved authorities to comply with local regulations.\n\n### 6.5.5 DETAILED KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n#### 6.5.5.1 VOC emissions from paint shops in tons and normalized\n\n| 2021 | VOC g/m\u00b2 painted | VOC tons |\n|------|------------------|----------|\n| Manufacturing Activities | | |\n| Enlarged Europe | 28.82 | 9,318 |\n| North America | 14.79 | 3,410 |\n| South America | 34.90 | 2,789 |\n| Middle East & Africa | 58.66 | 514 |\n| China and India & Asia Pacific | Not available | Not available |\n| **TOTAL** | **24.95** | **16,031** |\n\nVOC = Volatile Organic Compounds emitted into the air by coating operations\n\n#### 6.5.5.2 Industrial air emissions\n\n| 2021 | ODS kg of CFC-11 equivalent | NOx kg | SO\u2082 kg | Particulate Matter kg |\n|------|-----------------------------|--------|--------|----------------------|\n| Manufacturing Activities | | | | |\n| Enlarged Europe | 29.22 | 688,615 | 4,900 | 59,506 |\n| North America | 14.79 | 678,239 | 104,640 | 49,832 |\n| South America | 34.90 | 56,419 | 350 | 3,609 |\n| Middle East & Africa | 58.66 | 5,500 | 38 | 418 |\n| China and India & Asia Pacific | Not available | 522 | 11 | 58 |\n| **Total Manufacturing Activities** | **39** | **1,429,295** | **109,939** | **113,423** |\n| Retail | | | | |\n| | 34,186 | 215 | | 1,696 |\n| **Total** | **39** | **1,463,481** | **110,154** | **115,119** |\n\nODS = Ozone Depleting Substance.

We are aware that there are water-stressed areas around the world where less-efficient water use may have adverse social and environmental effects due to reduced water availability, quality and disruption of ecosystems.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nGRI 413-2\n\nAs a Global Compact member, Stellantis fully adheres to the sustainability development goals for clean water management.\n\nFurthermore, Stellantis obtained ISO 14001 certification for the vast majority of our plants and as such the Company is developing and implementing processes for improvement of water management.\n\nStellantis is committed to promote responsible water stewardship to strive for zero water withdrawal in industrial activities and to prevent any pollutant discharge. Where our plants are in area\u2019s with identified water stress, Stellantis is committed to implement extra water management measures.\n\n6.6.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\n| CSR ISSUE | VISION / AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | 2021 RESULTS |\n|-----------|-------------------|----------------|------------|--------------|\n| CSR issue #18 Sustainable water management in manufacturing Owners Chief Manufacturing Officer | Promote responsible water stewardship to strive for zero water withdrawal by water recycling in industrial activities. | Total water withdrawn normalized (m\u00b3/vehicle produced) | Short-term | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan) | Long-term |\n| | | | 2025: 3.5 m\u00b3/vehicle produced | 2030: 3.0 m\u00b3/vehicle produced | 2038: 2.0 m\u00b3/vehicle produced in water-stressed areas 2050: 1.0 m\u00b3/vehicle produced | 4.77 m\u00b3/vehicle produced |\n6.6.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nGRI 102-15  GRI 103-2\n\n6.6.3.1 Risk\n\nStellantis identified some risks and has implemented several actions and initiatives to mitigate them.\n\n- Potential risk for the business:\n  - developing manufacturing facilities in water-stressed areas may affect the local water use and the livelihood in the communities, leading to potential conflicts and water usage restrictions for our facilities;\n  - increased flood risk due to extreme weather events affecting facilities located close to rivers, in river basins or other geographical locations;\n  - water scarcity is an emerging global environmental topic and its affects are not fully experienced or understood in every region. This constraint may lead to an underestimation of the severity of the issue. Investment costs versus operational costs may make it difficult to implement new water saving technology and processes within manufacturing facilities in many regions.\n\n- Potential risks for operational management:\n  - water shortage may lead to increased water supply costs, reduction of production volume or disruption of operations, leading certain governments to impose more stringent requirements for obtaining and maintaining permits for water withdrawal. There are some facilities that need to change current operational permits to maintain operations;\n  - more stringent regulatory targets on pollution control of wastewater discharge are causing us to adapt our production processes or substitute raw materials, which may lead to increased cost for water treatment;\n  - extreme temperatures and droughts can cause the rise in temperatures of rivers and streams. When the water temperatures exceed the temperatures allowed by regulators, we may be restricted from discharging cooling waters from cogeneration power plants which could impact production.\n\n- Potential reputational risk:\n  - water management and target setting requires a site specific approach. The challenge is to meet stakeholder expectations with customized actions based the local water constraints;\n  - being held responsible by the general public or neighboring communities for exploiting or polluting shared water resources with our manufacturing facilities;\n  - being held responsible for increasing the water stress in regions where we develop new facilities. This may result in impact to brand value, customer defection and and loss of profit.\n\n6.6.3.2 Opportunities\n\nStellantis identified opportunities and has implemented several actions to seize them.\n\n- Opportunities for the business:\n  - adopt best practices and public scientific data and tools to assess water risks for facilities;\n  - direct investments toward facilities located in water-stressed areas or projects that have the biggest impact on water by reducing risk and increasing performance;\n  - design out pollutants from materials or processes to minimize water treatment and associated costs.\n\n- Opportunities for operational management:\n  - implement technology and processes that require less water for new facility design or facility redevelopment projects. Enable recycling or reuse of water to reduce dependency on the water resources may save water supply and clean-up costs. In existing facilities, the deployment of best practices shared amongst the manufacturing plants support efficiency improvements in water usage;\n  - adopt efficiency measures to reduce water usage and wastewater treatment may lead to less energy usage, and therefore have a positive impact on operational costs, as well as on CO\u2082 emissions combating climate change;\n  - implement internal water quality standards and clean-up goals to anticipate and address stringent targets set by regulators. In addition, improved water quality offers more options for reusing water.\nOpportunities for reputation:\n- maintain or improve water availability for others in locations of high water-stressed areas, enhance community relations, social acceptance to operate and increase brand value;\n- proactive disclosure of information regarding our sustainable water management initiatives, outreach activities with the neighboring community or education initiatives on water issues.\n\n6.6.4 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\n6.6.4.1 Main achievements on water management\n\nWater withdrawn\n\nIn 2021, we withdrew in total 27,540 thousand m\u00b3 of water, of which 27,142 thousand m\u00b3 were withdrawn by Manufacturing sites and 398 thousand m\u00b3 for Retail activities. The sources for our water supply was comprised of third-party or municipal water at 61%, surface water at 15% and groundwater at 24%. Stellantis does not abstract seawater, all water withdrawn is considered freshwater. In addition, 44,904 thousand m\u00b3 of water from surface waters were abstracted for cooling purposes at our own cogeneration plants.\n\nThe normalized water withdrawn for the all Stellantis businesses in 2021 was at 4.77 m\u00b3 per vehicle produced.\n\nOur manufacturing facilities vary widely in terms of plant size, production volume, operations performed, technologies installed, age of facility, all of which can influence water use and treatment. We analyze the performance of the best performing plants to identify and share best practices.\n\nThe best performing vehicle assembly plants were Mangualde and Tychy with a water withdrawal of 0.86 m\u00b3/vehicle produced. However, additional 35% of our vehicle assembly plants performed better than our medium-term target of 3.0 m\u00b3 per vehicle produced.\nThe majority of water withdrawn is used in Manufacturing activities for the following processes:\n- Vehicle painting;\n- Cooling;\n- Cleaning processes;\n- Sprinkler systems;\n- Sanitation and hygiene;\n- Drinking water;\n\nThe majority of water withdrawn for Retail activities is used for the following processes:\n- Sanitation and hygiene;\n- Drinking water;\n- Car washing in dealerships and workshops.\n\n**ASSEMBLY PLANTS**\n\n- 35% of our vehicle assembly plants with a water withdrawal below 3.0 m\u00b3 per vehicle produced\n- Mangualde, Portugal\n- Tychy, Poland\n- Water withdrawal of 0.86 m\u00b3 per vehicle produced\n- Best performing vehicle assembly plants\nWater discharged and pollution control\n\nIn 2021, we discharged in total 19,148 thousand m\u00b3 wastewater, of which 19,027 thousand m\u00b3 was discharged by Manufacturing sites, and 121 thousand m\u00b3 for our Retail activities. We discharged 67% into third-party / municipal industrial sewer systems, and 33% into surface waters. The wastewater discharge into the groundwater was negligible. Stellantis did not directly discharge any wastewater into seawater or oceans.\n\nWater discharge destination and volumes\n\nLike other industries that are using water for their production, vehicle manufacturing processes have some impact on water quality. One of the impacts is from the presence of metals from processes and materials used for surface treatment. Typical heavy metals are Cadmium (Cd), Chromium (Cr), Copper (Cu), Nickel (Ni), Lead (Pb) and Zinc (Zn). In addition, physical chemistry parameters such as Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Suspended Matter (SM) are typical water quality impacts from manufacturing operations of whatever kind. Therefore, most of the plants monitor their wastewater discharge for these water quality factors as outlined within their operational permit requirements.\n\nMany jurisdictions have implemented regulations to control the discharge of heavy metals. These regulations are regularly revised to increase the list of controlled substances or to further decrease emission limit values. These modifications are reflected in changes to the operational permits of our plants, which also specify the frequency of measurements and controls.\n\nMeeting legal and permit requirements is a given, however, we aim to discharge wastewater with regulated constituents at levels well below legal limits. As such, we regularly measure and analyze the quality of wastewater produced to obtain a comprehensive view of the impact on water quality. All production plants active in 2021 were serviced by either an internal or external wastewater treatment plant.\n\nHeavy metal loads\n\n| Metal   | kg/year |\n|---------|---------|\n| Chromium| 253     |\n| Lead    | 117     |\n| Nickel  | 11,702  |\n| Zinc    | 10,096  |\n| Cadmium | 1,049   |\n| Copper  | 63      |\n\nCOD, BOD, SM\n\n| Parameter | tons/year |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| COD       | 3,316     |\n| BOD       | 1,376     |\n| SM        | 439       |\n\nThe loads shown in the charts above include heavy metal loads for Stellantis plants in 2021. The loads were calculated with concentrations measured at the discharge monitoring points of our sites.\nWater consumption\n\nWater consumption is defined as water withdrawn minus water discharged. In 2021, we consumed a total amount of water of 8,392 thousand m\u00b3, of which 8,115 thousand m\u00b3 at manufacturing facilities and 277 thousand m\u00b3 at retail sites.\n\nThe difference between total withdrawn and discharge can be explained by additional rainwater supplied and discharged minus evaporated water from operations that necessarily have exposed water functions, such as water cooling towers. Some older plants do not have a separate sewer system for the collection and discharge of rainwater versus process wastewater or sanitary wastewater. In these cases, the municipal or Stellantis wastewater treatment plant must treat all such water discharge volumes, increasing its costs and our tax expenditures.\n\n6.6.4.2 Main initiatives on water management\n\nAs outlined in section 6.6.3, the main two water risks impacting operational management are related to water shortage resulting in increasing pressure of authorities to reduce water withdrawal as well as establishing more stringent discharge values to secure water quality. We apply best practices to support plants with the reduction of water usage and improvement of water quality.\n\nSome examples of successful initiatives to reduce water usage or improve water quality:\n\nAvoid or reduce losses and leakages:\n\n- A number of measures taken at our vehicle assembly plant in Ellesmere Port (UK) enabled us to save approximately 35,500 m\u00b3 per year. The measures included leakage repair, closing and isolation of redundant pipes and valves and adjusting water flow within the paint shop.\n\nRainwater collection:\n\n- At our site in Vesoul (France), we built a storage building for spare parts. Rainwater from the roof and parking areas is collected and used for sanitary water purposes. The full capacity of the tank provides rainwater for 60 days, reducing the total amount of fresh water we would need.\n\nCooling tower water reuse:\n\n- We implemented several measures at our vehicle assembly plant Hordain (France) to enable reuse cooling tower treatment water. This process saved approximately 4,000 m\u00b3 water per year. We are reusing water for cleaning conveyor sleds in our paint shop which is estimated to save approximately 2,000 m\u00b3 water per year.\n\n- We recognized at our Kokomo Transmission plant, U.S. that a high loss of water was from the cooling towers (46%). To reduce its usage, we implemented multiple engineering and management measures, which reduced water consumption by 120,000 m\u00b3 water per year.\n\nProcess improvement:\n\n- We modified our quench tank system at Kokomo Casting plant, U.S., to further cool quenched parts, which allowed more efficient physical handling of parts from our workers, such as eliminating water overflow and maintenance down time. We were able to reach a reduction of approximately 7,800 m\u00b3 water per year.\n\n- At our Saltillo North Engine Plant, Mexico we enhanced the groundwater extraction, treatment and water reduction process to improve the Reverse Osmosis (RO) softening system to reduce water consumption in this water-stressed area of Mexico. We installed a second-stage RO system, reducing groundwater extraction. We built a detention pond next to the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) and installed an evaporator unit to evaporate the highly briny water from the RO reject.\n\n- At our engine plant Hosur (India), we are able to collect and store RO rejection water in a 5 m\u00b3 tank for reuse in our cafeteria. This simple measure helped saving approximately 3,300 m\u00b3 water per year.\n### 6.6.5 Detailed Key Performance Indicators\n\n#### GRI 303-1, GRI 303-3, GRI 303-4, GRI 303-5, GRI 413-2\n\n#### 6.6.5.1 Annual water withdrawal\\(^1\\) by business, geographical area and source\n\n| 2021          | 3rd party or municipal water | Surface water | Groundwater |\n|---------------|------------------------------|---------------|-------------|\n| Manufacturing | Enlarged Europe              | 5,427         | 4,114       | 4,583       |\n|               | North America                | 9,782         | 24          | 1,456       |\n|               | South America                | 957           | 81          | 465         |\n|               | Middle East & Africa         | 178           | -

It is closely linked with other top risks identified such as climate change, extreme weather and natural disasters highlighting the complexity of nature, and the volatile ways of impacting us as human beings and industrial corporations.\n\nEven though the protection of biodiversity is a complex process and the impact of the Company\u2019s manufacturing operations on biodiversity is relatively limited, Stellantis has implemented dedicated measures aimed at further minimizing this issue. The activities are focused on biodiversity inventories, awareness campaigns for employees, and other stakeholders such as the community surrounding our manufacturing facilities, and working with students, all for preservation of natural habitats near its areas of operations.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nStellantis\u2019s plants endeavor to ensure biodiversity knowledge and preventative actions relevant to their geographic scope along with the development of biodiversity on the related sites by preserving natural habitats and by implementing projects. Stellantis is currently assessing different biodiversity management tools in order to meet the upcoming requirements stemming from the European Taxonomy legislative proposal.\n6.7.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\n| CSR ISSUE | VISION / AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | 2021 RESULTS |\n|-----------|-------------------|----------------|------------|--------------|\n| CSR issue #19 Protection of biodiversity Owners Chief Manufacturing Officer | Ensure the development of biodiversity on our sites by preserving natural habitats. | Percentage of plants that have done a RENATU evaluation and are developing biodiversity projects. | Short-term: 2025: 60% | 2021 RESULTS: 26% |\n| | | | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan): 2030: 100% | |\n| | | | Long-term: 2050: strategic partnership for global biodiversity program. | |\n\n6.7.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n6.7.3.1 Risks\n\nStellantis identified some risks and has implemented several actions and initiative to mitigate them.\n\n- Potential risks for the business:\n  - dependency of business on natural resources such as air, soil or water for its direct operations or indirect supply chain. According to the New Nature Economy Report 2020 issued by World Economic Forum, the automotive industry\u2019s dependency on nature is assessed to be low to medium for its direct gross value added, whereas the gross value added of the automotive industry\u2019s supply chain was assessed to be more dependent on nature and therefore referred to as a \u201chidden dependency\u201d;\n  - loss in nature causing socio-economic instability in countries of operation resulting in disrupted business continuity or loss in markets.\n\n- Potential risk for operational management:\n  - regulatory and legal risk of increased governmental actions on biodiversity are expected, such as restrictions on land usage or usage of ecosystem services. Potential increase in taxes, insurance premiums, new trade directives or reforming subsidies and increased disclosure requirements may be expected;\n  - climate change causing loss in natural habitats such as forests that were served as important buffer areas during extreme weather events may lead to the potential for severe impact on business continuity;\nvalue of real estate may be endangered by invasive species or diseases, causing costs for removal, pest control, subsequent remedy measures and potential legal proceedings if surrounding areas are affected.\n\nPotential reputational risk:\n- being held responsible by customers or the general public for loss in biodiversity from building new or expanding facilities, by materials or technology used in products or sourcing of raw material in its supply chain, and emissions from our products. This may result in a negative impact to our brands\u2019 value, customer defection, loss of profit and conflicts with neighboring community.\n\n6.7.3.2 Opportunities\n\nStellantis identified opportunities and has implemented several actions to seize them.\n\nOpportunities for the business:\n- corporate land areas can be an important contribution to climate action, for example as a source of carbon sequestration or increased resilience for the human-made, built and natural environments;\n- major infrastructure projects or expansion of existing facilities, are highly dependent on stakeholder acceptance. Integrating conservation measures as part of the site selection and implementation can help with adding value to neighboring communities and building acceptance with stakeholders;\n- work with supply chain to reduce indirect impact on biodiversity loss and reduce hidden dependency of the automotive industry.\n\nOpportunities for operational management:\n- Stellantis conservation and education activities contribute to maintaining a social acceptance to operate;\n- conservation measures may also add value to the real estate property or may increase its resistance toward climate change related extreme weather such as droughts, floods, etc. besides providing a more attractive environment for employees.\n\nOpportunities for company reputation:\n- Stellantis conservation practices on corporate land demonstrate a long-term commitment to quality habitat for wildlife, conservation education and community outreach initiatives;\n- talent attraction and retention by offering employee biodiversity engagement activities that meet a variety of needs including work-life balance, health and wellness and providing value to the communities in which Stellantis operates;\n- communicating a company\u2019s efforts to further biodiversity and sustainability is an important driver to gaining value to a company\u2019s social acceptance to operate and positive brand value.\n\n6.7.4 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nStellantis uses the tool RENATU to evaluate biodiversity at green areas located at its production facilities. RENATU is a self-assessment tool developed to evaluate the biodiversity of industrial sites or developed areas. It was developed by the University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne and has been designed and scientifically validated within the framework of the ITTECOP (Infrastructure de transport terrestre \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me et paysage) program of the French Ministry of the Ecological Transition and Solidarity.\n\nThe RENATU indicator consists 11 categories that address items such as: invasive species, various vegetation layers, the presence of microhabitats, nesting sites and distance to biodiversity reservoirs. The assessment is conducted by site walkthroughs and data analysis. Each category is rated to determine the total score.\n\nIn 2021, Stellantis started to roll-out RENATU at its production facilities and the average score obtained was 32.57 points (out of 55 points maximum) with 9.00 points achieved by the lowest scoring plant and 52.88 points by the best scoring plant. Opportunities for improving green areas to attract more biodiversity remain subject to plant specific situations.\nHowever, by evaluating the undeveloped areas within the plant, the main purpose for using RENATU is to raise awareness for biodiversity issues on site, to enable a simplified assessment and monitoring, and to encourage developing ideas for preserving or improving biodiversity at the green spots of the industrial facilities.\n\nWe defined our approach towards biodiversity implemented projects. 26% of Stellantis production facilities has conducted a RENATU evaluation and implemented a biodiversity project- a solid base for growth in the next years.\n\nMost of Stellantis production facilities are located in suburban industrial areas. However, 66 plants are located less than 5 km away from a nature protected area an overview table is provided in section 6.7.5.\n\nWe developed biodiversity projects that involve activities such as restoration, conservation or monitoring measures. To ensure we develop projects meaningful for the environment, we engaged third-party experts who helped us plan, verify or certify our projects. Third-party experts include universities or other scientific research institutes, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) engaged in biodiversity or nature protection, professional biodiversity consultants or local regulators.\nStellantis works with the Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC) for biodiversity project certification. In 2021, we had about 14 certified sites located in Canada, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Spain and the United States. The Stellantis U.S. headquarters and Technology Center in Michigan (U.S.) was awarded a WHC certified Gold status for its biodiversity program. And there are about 13 certified production facilities three of which are WHC certified Silver.\n\nWINDSOR ASSEMBLY PLANT, CANADA - AWARDED THE WHC IBIS AWARD 2021\n\nThe Ibis Award recognizes certified Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC) programs that have demonstrated resilience of spirit and advancement of conservation despite lockdowns, quarantines and additional government-mandated regulations.\n\nSince 2009, the Windsor Assembly Plant has hosted educational events, such as tree planting, for Windsor residents. Participants planted 1,500 trees across the property to address the lack of urban tree canopy in the area. During the COVID-19 pandemic the team remained committed to providing socially-distanced environmental education. Some of the additional offerings included tree identification, virtual geocaching and identification of native plants, birds, fish and animals.\n\nWhile the organizers received submissions from everyone from preschoolers to site employees, most of the participants were secondary school students. The teens could use the activities to fulfill community service hours required for graduation, during a time when pandemic-related closures made finding volunteer work difficult. Extra credit was given to students who participated in habitat enhancement work, such as planting native wildflowers or trees, and submitted proof to the organizers.\n\n6.7.4.1 Initiatives to support and restore biodiversity\n\nIn 2021, we had 55 biodiversity projects implemented. The following summaries represent examples of Stellantis biodiversity projects:\n\nWildlife Habitat Council (WHC) projects:\n- The vehicle manufacturing plant located in Gliwice (Poland) has contributed to the restoration of the river D\u0105browa by planting native trees along the stream and doing maintenance and monitoring of the vegetation and wildlife. On another area of the site, a wildflower meadow was planted for feeding and housing pollinators. Both projects are accompanied by conducting awareness training for employees on biodiversity and ecology and are certified by the Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC).\n- Our engine plant in Dundee (U.S.) is completing an invasive species project. It has been eliminating invasive and harmful flora such as phragmites, Canadian thistle and any cottonwoods trees that grow into the prairie grass. The project was submitted to the Wildlife Habitat Council in 2021 and the plant is certified silver.\n\nBiodiversity restore projects:\n- The components plant in Caen (France), began in 2021 its biodiversity program. There was a change in green space management, with around 50% of the vegetated area moved only once a year to promote local wild flora and pollinators. To monitor the impact, existing plant species were inventoried and 45 of these species could be added to the regional biodiversity atlases. This was the first of several projects that are being developed locally accompanied by the Permanent Center for the Environmental Initiatives (CPIE) of Vall\u00e9e de l\u2019Orne. With the support of the Norman Mammalogical Group (GMN), we have detected protected mammals such as the common bat and the European hedgehog on our site. As a result, bat boxes were installed and the site has been designated as a bat refuge since September 2021. In another area, around 1,000 m\u00b2 of sealed surface was set back to increase surface permeability and the area was prepared for the creation of a small forest and a rain garden.\n- The biodiversity project at our assembly plant in Goiana (Brazil) aims to conserve part of the Atlantic Forest biome in Pernambuco state involving Stellantis employees and their families, partners and the local community. The project emerged from\ncollaboration with researchers from the Federal University and the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco who conducted field studies and surveys of flora and fauna. To support the conservation of local biome, the plant complex decided to plant only native species on its premises. Since the beginning of the project in 2014, we planted more than 100 thousand seedlings of around 300 different species of which 27 are endangered species. The seedlings are produced in our nursery located at the site and is operated with the help of S\u00f3 Mudas Nativas (Only Native Seedlings). Besides the production and planting of seedlings at ecological islands in the vicinity of the plant, employees were invited to the nursery to learn about biodiversity concepts and plants on UN World Environment Day. We donated seedlings to nearby cities and NGOs for their forestation projects.\n\nBiodiversity conservation projects:\n\n- At our plant located in Verrone (Italy) a part of our premises is a natural protected area covered with woodland that provides nesting conditions for birds. The authority of the nearby Lame del Sesia natural park visits our site each season to monitor the number of nesting herons. The plant worked with the natural park authority to keep favorable conditions for the protected birds by maintaining the vegetation and the accesses to the nesting areas.\n\n- At our engine plant in Campo Largo (Brazil) we implemented a project that aims to preserve the Araucaria Forest located on our site and to raise awareness of biodiversity for employees, the surrounding communities and, children. The Araucaria Forest belongs to the Atlantic Forest Biome and is shrinking due to agricultural land usage to feed the growing cities. The project started with an expert survey of the flora and fauna conducted by Sociedade de Pesquisa em Vida Selvagem e Educa\u00e7\u00e3o Ambiental (Society for Wildlife Research and Environmental Education) and advised on maintenance and monitoring activities. The environmental education activities for school students of neighboring communities are conducted by \u201cStellantis Trail Guides\u201d, volunteers trained to welcome visitors at the \u201cForest House\u201d and guide them. The Araucaria Trail is a path of about 2 km within the conservation area. Along this path educational points are placed to explain the ecosystem.\n\nGreening Detroit project:\n\n- Stellantis gave an overall commitment to revive the tree canopy of the east side of Detroit close to our vehicle assembly plant Mack (U.S.) by planting 1,100 new trees. Urban tree canopies provide numerous benefits to communities and to the environment. They reduce air pollution and summer peak temperatures, provide wildlife habitats and neighborhood beautification, which can increase property values and improve social ties among neighbors and within the community. Over 400 trees were planted onsite. Stellantis has partnered with The Greening of Detroit to offer free street trees to residents within the immediate neighborhood. In 2021, we started by planting the first 160 trees and working together with residents and community organizations to identify street tree sites. The trees include native species such as hackberry, redbud, sweetgum and zelkova. These species support local wildlife and pollinators, provide natural air filtration, reduce storm water runoff, energy usage and improve community well-being.\n\nAMAZON FOREST CARBON SINK PROJECT\n\nThe Peugeot brand, in partnership with the France National Forestry Office (ONF), is contributing to the PEUGEOT-ONF forest carbon sink project in Mato Grosso, Brazil since 1998. The project involves reforesting areas of degraded land and restoring biodiversity while studying the relationship between reforestation and the absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The total amount of carbon sequestered by biomass and soil was estimated to be more than 645,000 tons of CO\u2082 equivalent according to the measurement methods of the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS). The VCU are sold under the VCS protocol and revenues are systematically reinvested in the project. Two million trees including more than 50 native species, were reintroduced in a plantation of nearly 2,000 hectares. At the heart of the project, an area of 1,800 hectares of virgin forest with high biodiversity value has been devoted to scientific research and placed under the status of \u201cReserva de Patrimonio Natural (RPPN) since 2009. More than 20 new global species were discovered, among them a fish named \u201cHyphessobrycon peugeoti\u201d and a beetle called \u201cHansreia peugeoti\u201d.\n\nHistorical factory roof transformed in a public garden\n\nThe Fiat brand has transformed its historical test track on the roof of its former Lingotto factory in Turin into a hanging garden. A formerly inaccessible test track has become, in the words of Olivier Fran\u00e7ois - CEO of the Fiat brand - \u201cthe largest roof garden in Europe\u201d. More than 40,000 plants now cover an area of 2.7 hectares of the roof of the historic factory, the size of three football fields. The old track, where Fiat cars were tested as soon as they came off the assembly lines, will now be reserved exclusively for electric vehicles, bicycles and scooters.\n### 6.7.5 Detailed Key Performance Indicators\n\n**GRI 304-1**\n\n**GRI 304-2**\n\n**GRI 304-3**\n\n#### 6.7.5.1 Plants located within or near (< 5 km) a natural protected area in 2021\n\n| Region                  | Plant                          | Plant activity | Surface occupied (m\u00b2) | Type of natural protected area                                                                 |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Enlarged Europe -

This results in challenges for companies that have established ethical and social standards to ensure that their principles are respected at all stages of the supply chain. Conducting our business with sustainable business practices is a core value at Stellantis. We are firmly committed to act in a socially responsible manner and in line with sustainable practices within Stellantis and at each level of the supply base that include; ensuring the health and safety of its workforce, prohibiting human rights violations such as child labor and forced labor, and complying with conflict minerals and environmental protection regulations. We encourage the adoption and sharing of sustainable practices among our business partners and suppliers at all levels in the supply chain.\n\nBuilding strong responsible supply chains is an important focus for Stellantis. We use assessment tools that focus on topics such as the environment, labor and human rights, ethics and sustainable procurement. This approach helps develop opportunities within the supplier organizations while minimizing risk and potential reputational damage in the event of a failure in the supply chain. Stellantis monitors compliance with its Code of Conduct and the respect for human rights by its partners and subcontractors and by requiring contractual commitments and ongoing evaluations.\n\nStellantis pays particular attention to redistributing the value created for the benefit of the local communities where the Company operates. We achieve these goals by providing employment opportunities and through our philanthropic actions. Supplier localization is an important strategy. When suppliers are close to Stellantis manufacturing locations it supports the local community and reduces the risk of supply disruption.\n\n7.1 RESPONSIBLE PURCHASING PRACTICES (INCLUDING LOCAL SOURCING DEVELOPMENT) TO SUPPORT THE COMPANY\u2019S DEVELOPMENT IN HOST TERRITORIES\n\n7.1.1 CONTEXT AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\nCSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE #20: Responsible purchasing practices (including local sourcing development) to support the company\u2019s development in host territories\n\nIn order to support the Company\u2019s increasing internationalization and to reduce inequality in terms of economic development in host communities, it is crucial to boost local production close to final markets. Stellantis implements optimization measures such as: identifying local suppliers, supporting them in\ngaining necessary skills and we encourage current suppliers to relocate closer to our facilities to be aligned to our long-term strategic plans for globalization. This strategy has potential financial implications as it reduces inbound logistics costs, limits customs duties and reduces exposure to exchange rate fluctuations which impact production cost, margins and sales volumes. Reduction of long distance shipping benefits the environment by decreasing CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nLocal sourcing allows us to better understand the expectations of stakeholders. Some of the expectations include technological solutions which fit the context and constraints within the area; taking advantage of operational proximity with partners; helping to achieve technological, logistical, social and environmental progress and benefiting from increased flexibility in the supply chain.\n\n**Company\u2019s public position**\n\nThe monitoring of CSR issues related to supply chain management is of high importance to Stellantis. Responsibility for managing the supply chain does not end at the Tier 1 level. Stellantis uses its sphere of influence to promote its sustainable purchasing practices all the way through the supply chain to the very origin and lowest level of our chain. The Company works to ensure the conditions to build and sell vehicles that meet customer expectations in compliance with social, environmental and ethical standards following the OECD Guiding Principles and the International Labor Organization (ILO) rules for human rights such as child labor and forced labor (refer to 7.1.5 and 7.2.5 for further details). Stellantis is a member of the UN Global Compact and also promotes the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the United Nations Convention against Corruption to its suppliers. We acknowledge the necessity to comply with rules for the responsible sourcing of materials, such as in the global battery value chain. Through the efforts of all companies the responsibilities are shared through our extended supply network. To make sure that our principles are duly met, we conduct targeted audits where risks are identified. We are vigilant with the implementation of measures within our sphere of influence. All these goals, practices and responsibilities are globally common in all our locations and countries we operate in and for all suppliers within our worldwide network that we deal with.\n\n**Involvement in host communities**\n\nThe Company helps to set a context that is favorable to the development of the automotive industry including manufacturers, suppliers and equipment manufacturers in host communities. Working both internationally and locally, the Company is a stakeholder in initiatives to improve the automotive industry profile. A few examples of the work we do are: membership with the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) which provides cross-sector engagement in responsible mineral sourcing, and in France, we are working in coordination with the Automotive Platform (PFA) to define and implement strategies for innovation, employment and skills. Stellantis also contributes revitalization funds to support the development of companies of the future.\n\nIn order to maintain the competitiveness of Stellantis sites, it is key to be able to complement local sourcing with competitive imported materials, while maintaining an environmental and social level playing field.\n### 7.1.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\n| CSR ISSUE | VISION / AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | 2021 RESULTS |\n|-----------|-------------------|----------------|------------|--------------|\n| CSR issue #20 | Responsible purchasing practices (including local sourcing development) to support the company\u2019s development in host territories | Ensure selection of suppliers based on quality, competitiveness, and social, ethical and environmental standards, hence supporting responsible economic development in host territories. | % Annual Purchase Value (APV) purchased from Tier 1 suppliers evaluated on CSR | 2025: 90% Target to be established by the Board of Directors | More than 83% by 2 providers (NQC and Ecovadis) |\n| Owner | Chief Purchasing and Supply Chain Officer | | | | |\n| | | Short-term | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan) | Long-term | |\n| | | 2025: 90% Target to be established by the Board of Directors | 2030: 95% of APV of direct material (parts) 75% of APV of indirect material | 2050: Maintain 95% of APV for direct material 90% APV for indirect material | |\n| | | Average CSR scores of Stellantis Tier-1 Suppliers assessed by independent third-party vs average CSR scores of all companies assessed by third party | 2025: 15% Target to be established by the Board of Directors | 2030: keep a positive gap of 15% | 16.2% |\n| | | | | 2050: keep a positive gap of 15% | |\n7.1.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nSuppliers as key participants in the value-creation chain\n\nResponsibility for managing the supply network rests upon each participant of the supply chain. Stellantis aims to generate direct and indirect income and employment opportunities for the communities where the business is located. Faced with growing inequality in the economic development of the regions, it is vital to focus on redistributing the value created by the companies in the local communities in which they operate. We have the opportunity to strengthen our reputation in the territories and markets we operate in, as well as among civil society. When we enhance business opportunities in our host territories we create mutually beneficial situations, which include effects like the reduction of logistics costs and its carbon footprint, as well as employment stability for the area.\n\nStellantis has a direct contractual relationship with more than 2,000 tier-1 suppliers in direct material. It requires all of them to meet the CSR commitments set out in its Responsible Purchasing Guidelines (for more information, see section 7.2.5).\n\n2021 KEY SUPPLY CHAIN FIGURES\n\n- Tier 1 Suppliers: >2,000\n- Number of Countries of Our Supply Base: >60\n- Value of Purchases Worldwide: > \u20ac 82 Bn\n\nRaw Material impact in % per APV Purchased globally\n\n- RARE EARTHS: 1.7%\n- LEAD: 0.4%\n- PLASTICS: 19.1%\n- STEEL: 18.5%\n- ELECTRONICS: 18.3%\n- ALUMINUM: 19.1%\n- COPPER: 11.5%\n- COBALT, LITHIUM: 6.6%\n- PGM: 8.7%\n- RUBBER: 5.8%\n- GLASSES: 1.8%\n- PAINT AND COATINGS: 2.3%\n- RAW MATERIAL IMPACT IN % PER APV PURCHASED GLOBALLY\n\n1 Platinum Group Metals\nThe Stellantis supply chain has two main distinguishing features:\n\n- it is complex and involves a large number of different participants, starting from receiving a customer order which begins the engagement with our suppliers for materials, goods and services, up to the delivery to our customers world wide;\n- it must handle a wide diversity of possible combinations, and relies on its ability to successfully supply thousands of component combinations, which relies on successful supplier operations.\n\n**IMPACT MEASUREMENT OF THE ELECTRIFICATION STRATEGY**\n\nElectrification relies on raw materials necessary to produce battery components. Stellantis\u2019 Responsible Purchasing Guidelines integrates requirements regarding materials such as cobalt, where battery suppliers have strict obligations to disclose their raw material suppliers. Stellantis annually maps the sourcing of materials that are essential to electric vehicle battery manufacturing and is a member of the RMI to improve risk-identification in its supply chain. Due diligence is specifically conducted in the cobalt and lithium supply chains in partnership with RCS Global, which conducted 40 external on-site audits on critical suppliers in 2021.\n\nFurthermore, in order to secure the supply of critical materials needed to produce low-emission vehicles, Stellantis has reinforced its lithium supply with direct sourcing in Europe and North America. This local sourcing initiative will facilitate due diligence and supply chain mapping regarding lithium (See 2.7.3).\n## Risk #1\n\n### Complexity of extended supply chains\n\nStellantis seeks to produce vehicles that are attractive to our global customers based on their diverse values and preferences. Creating vehicles that delight the customer requires working with a complex and extended supply chain.\n\nWe might face the risk of not being able to procure what we need because of concerns regarding human rights violations, market tensions, geopolitical disruptions, natural disasters and availability of natural resources, among others. The expectations for treatment of people needs to be clear for all levels of the extended supply network. For more information related to human rights in the supply chain refer to section 7.2. Some countries have requirements for local sourcing content and Stellantis must address this factor and the issues that may arise. Regulatory requirements can change suddenly and become inconsistent from one region to another. Financial risk for each entity in the supply chain is important to consider. Complex supply chains often require a higher degree of coordination taking into account dependencies between supply chain entities and can be vulnerable to disruption due to the many inputs. One additional risk is the shortage of important raw materials and/or local and global pandemic shutdowns that prevent actors at any level of the supply chain to produce goods and services as requested.\n\nNegative impacts are caused by interruptions to the flow of material, whether raw material, parts or services. Failure to apply appropriate supply chain management can have long lasting effects. An approach based on continuous risk assessment with the objective of reducing exposure to risk and improving performance is an important strategy. Stellantis aims to secure its global supply and avoid costly downtime in global production plants.\n\n### Potential Impact\n\n- Increased environmental impact for CO\u2082 emissions due to the distance traveled to provide the goods or services refer to section 2.7;\n- Human Rights violations in the extended supply network, especially in sub-tier sourcing refer to section 7.2;\n- Disruption of the supply chain due to the\n  - failure or loss of suppliers;\n  - raw material shortage both locally and global;\n  - pandemic shutdowns or lower tier supplier disruptions;\n  - difficulty in accessing local skills among suppliers;\n  - poor quality due to multiple points of input;\n  - risk of counterfeiting and misuse of intellectual property could increase with many layers of sub-suppliers;\n  - risk of losing parts interchangeability (increased diversity).\n\n### Mitigation Strategy\n\n**Identify**\n\n- Code of Conduct and Responsible Sourcing policy\n- Supplier CSR assessments reviewed during sourcing\n- Supply Chain CSR Risk profiling via annual risk mapping activities.\n\n**Monitor**\n\n- Increase transparency of relationships throughout the extended supply network by partnering with service providers for supply chain mapping (RCS Global + battery suppliers or CMRT process, CDP and SGS)\n- World wide monitoring for Stellantis Tier 1, some sub-tier for specific topics\n- Supplier CSR assessments updated per specified frequency\n\n**Manage**\n\n- Audit activities to confirm compliance and discover areas for development and improved performance via an action plan\n\n### Additional Opportunities\n\n- Auto industry knowledge/resources/tools development via associations (RMI, DS, AIAG, etc)\n- Supplier training events\n- Collaborative innovation with different levels within the extended supply chain\n- Optimization; process, development, schedule, industrial capacity\n## Risk #2\n### Environmental impacts from operations and natural disasters within the supply chain\n\n**Risk Description**\nInequality in economic development can cause problems with creating long term relationships within host territories with our stakeholders and specifically with suppliers. It is beneficial to boost local production in order to support our increasing internationalization plans. When our suppliers are located close to our operations it drives more efficient supply and helps to minimize environmental concerns, while providing improved economic opportunities for the entire community.\n\n**Potential Impact**\n- When suppliers are positioned close to our operations we may avoid additional costs related to; logistics, customs duties, carbon tax penalties, exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, while also benefiting from initiatives to drive local economy development;\n- failure to develop host territories could hinder Stellantis\u2019s efforts to reduce scope 3 CO\u2082 emissions from suppliers (refer to section 2);\n- skeptical public opinion can occur regarding the redistribution of generated wealth if development of host territories is lacking\n\n**Mitigation Strategy**\nImplementing measures in two separate areas:\n- Identification of local suppliers and assisting them to gain the needed skills and operational capacity\n- Encourage our existing suppliers to relocate to clusters near to its facilities\n\nBy implementing these measures we are able to gain operational proximity which supports progress in technology, CSR and logistics. We also improve supply chain flexibility and reduce supply chain risk. By enhancing control of tier-n suppliers it is possible to take account of the supply risks inherent in the multi-layered subcontracting chain.\n\n**Additional Opportunities**\n- Reduce inbound logistics elements such as costs, CO\u2082 emissions and time to deliver products and services to our operations\n- Better knowledge of local operating methods and in the local stakeholder expectations\n- Focusing on local supplier development can support suppliers becoming more competitive and could drive the ability to access more international organizations in the future\n- Strengthen brand recognition and potentially increase sales of our products\n\n## Risk #3\n### Inequality of economic development in host territories\n\n**Risk Description**\nIt is necessary to develop supply chains that are sustainable and can successfully manage multiple environmental impacts; such as those related to their own operations, physical damage from natural disasters or supply shortages. For activities related to supplier operations, starting from raw materials through to the production of goods and services, environmental impacts need to be appropriately addressed with robust standard operating procedures. The risk for supply disruption and reputational damage can occur if sufficient attention to an issue is lacking. Evaluating the impact of procuring and transporting the products, goods and materials through the supply chain (from the purchase of raw materials to network distribution) is essential to manage consumer expectations and the risks posed from the increasing number, scope and ambition of regulatory requirements.\n\n**Potential Impact**\n- ecosystem degradation (refer to 6.1.3), i.e. deforestation and mining;\n- climate change (refer to 2.3.1.2);\n- exposure to eco-taxes levied on transport, as well as fossil energy price fluctuations\n- localized pollution impacts such as water, air and sound e.g. bauxite mining for aluminum production\n\n**Mitigation Strategy**\n- optimize transport plans - development of alternate modes of transport (refer to 2.7.3) for more information\n- ISO 14001 certification of suppliers (via a Sustainability Assessment Questionnaire review)\n- Engage key suppliers with major Annual Purchased Value coverage (61% of direct suppliers) with corporate carbon accounting activities (via CDP in the short term)\n\n**Additional Opportunities**\n- reduce upstream and downstream delivery times\n- best practice sharing\n- improving transport costs upstream (parts)\n7.1.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nThe Global Purchasing and Supply Chain department (GPSC) is the interface between Stellantis and its suppliers. The GPSC is responsible for meeting all legal and regulatory requirements under its scope and to require that all suppliers are fully compliant with Company policies to reduce the risk of exposure to the Company. This is its major duty of care toward supplier management across the globe. To support the direction of the GPSC, the Global Purchasing and Supply Chain EVP is a direct report to the CEO, and a member of the Top Executive Team, and as such, a member of the company\u2019s strategy council.\n\nThe Global Purchasing and Supply Chain department coordinates actions at different levels: centrally, in its international sites and within its various local offices spread globally. To fulfill its role, the GPSC organizes the following priorities by seeking to ensure:\n\n- the competitiveness and responsible procurement of products, equipment and services purchased for the manufacture of Stellantis vehicles and subassemblies by selecting accomplished responsible suppliers able to meet Stellantis\u2019 and stakeholder requirements;\n- that suppliers provide the Company with innovative, sustainable solutions that can give it a competitive edge by liaising closely with the Automotive Research and Advanced Engineering departments;\n- that the Company benefits from the expertise of its suppliers on the best economic terms by continually recommending improvements to quality and costs and seeing that they feed into all phases of the product life cycle;\n- the quality and security of supplies by verifying that suppliers intrinsically meet the standards required by the Company in terms of social and environmental responsibility, quality and logistics;\n- that a panel of responsible, viable and capable suppliers is established by taking all the necessary actions to support and secure the automotive industry in the best interests of Stellantis.\n\nThe Global Purchasing and Supply Chain Department is globally focused while taking local action, as appropriate. To support this it is necessary to work closely with other internal departments such as engineering, logistics, industrial and program teams and in general with all operating entities within Stellantis and its outside stakeholders.\n\nThe Stellantis sourcing process includes supplier CSR performance as a critical evaluation factor. If the supplier performance is below the acceptable level a deviation with an action plan to correct issues is required. Governance is in place with monthly Purchasing and Supply Chain Leadership Team Meetings, hosted by the Chief Global Purchasing and Supply Chain Officer to monitor supplier CSR performance during sourcing.\n\nThe Global Purchasing and Supply Chain Department focuses on Raw Material management and applies appropriate due diligence using a risk matrix for specific materials. Approximately 25 materials are included in the evaluation, among them, tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold are designated as conflict minerals and of critical importance in this process. Our Conflict Minerals program is managed by regional and subsidiary conflict minerals team members (refer to 7.2.4). A global lead provides overall program management and consolidation direction to ensure that the corporate obligation is fulfilled. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings are regulatory documents that companies must submit to the SEC on an annual base. The purchasing commodity directors support escalation as needed to reinforce the importance of this legal requirement. The document was filed with SEC in June 2021.\n\nStellantis has a long history working with the sheltered sector, where most workers are persons with disabilities. Suppliers in the adapted and sheltered sector are meeting the same standards as the Company\u2019s other suppliers based on criteria such as quality, responsiveness and financial performance. Since developing this expertise, some sheltered suppliers have marketed their know-how to other customers and business sectors such as rail and aeronautical.\n\nTop supplier business review meetings are conducted annually with the objective to share and align strategies at the highest level of both companies while identifying value creation initiatives for mutual benefit. During the discussions emphasis is placed on social and environmental topics. These meetings can be regional or global depending on the classification and relationship with the supplier and are hosted by purchasing executives.\n7.1.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nThe Stellantis Code of Conduct has specific language pertaining to Responsible Purchasing and this message is reinforced in internal and external policies.\n\nCustomers, Suppliers and Business Partners\n\nConducting our business with sustainable business practices is a core value at Stellantis. We encourage the adoption and sharing of sustainable practices among our business partners, suppliers and dealers. We are committed to sustainable practices in our procurement activity. The selection of suppliers is based on the quality and competitiveness of their products and services and on their adherence to social, ethical and environmental principles while maintaining high standards of quality and taking care of the communities where we do business.\n\nWhistleblowing\n\nStellantis reinforces that employees, suppliers, dealers, consumers and other stakeholders can and should report any concerns of alleged situations, events, or actions that may have been inconsistent with the Stellantis Code of Conduct and request advice about the application of the Code.\n\nWe are firmly committed to act in a socially responsible manner and in line with sustainable practices within Stellantis and at each level of the supply base that include working to ensure the health and safety of its workforce, prohibiting child labor and forced labor, and complying with conflict minerals and environmental protection regulations (for additional information refer to 5.1.4.1).\n\nResponsible Purchasing and Support for the Respect of Human Rights in the Supply Chain\n\nStellantis promotes the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the United Nations Convention against Corruption to its suppliers.\n\nStellantis Responsible Purchasing Guidelines\n\nStellantis follows the due diligence approach advocated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Company has set up its Responsible Purchasing Guidelines in compliance with International Labor Organization (ILO) rules for human rights such as child labor and forced labor. In this guideline, the Company encourages its suppliers to be vigilant for CSR risks within their supply chain. The guideline includes a third-party assessment by EcoVadis, of its suppliers based on CSR criteria. Stellantis conducted evaluation activities to compare the benefits of the two leading Sustainability Assessment Questionnaires (SAQ); EcoVadis and Drive Sustainability. The findings reinforced the decision to utilize EcoVadis as the main data source for the Stellantis supply base. This guideline will be available on the Stellantis website.\n\nThis policy supports the Company efforts to secure its supply chains and also intends to boost supplier performance, who are called on to introduce CSR policies within their own organization and with their supply and subcontracting chains.\n\nThe content of the Responsible Purchasing Guidelines covers:\n\n- compliance with law;\n- promotion of and compliance with internationally accepted human rights;\n- freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining;\n- elimination of any forms of forced or compulsory labor;\n- effective fight against child labor and modern slavery;\n- elimination of discrimination in terms of hiring and occupation;\n- Anti-corruption measures and the prevention of conflicts of interest;\n- compliance with the legal minimum wage;\n- working hours not exceeding those set out in national legislation or collective bargaining agreements;\n- compliance with health and safety at work;\n- implementation of an Environmental Management System such as ISO 14001 certification;\nbanning the use of prohibited substances and materials;\n- suppliers to obtain CSR commitment from their own suppliers;\n- combating the use of minerals originating from areas of conflict;\n- storage and use of personal data;\n- implementation of an environmental policy for research on green or recycled materials and the reduction of CO\u2082 emissions;\n- protection of animal welfare.\n\nThe Stellantis Responsible Purchasing Guidelines requires the suppliers to sign and it serves to:\n\n**Boost Innovation**\n\nThe Company involves its core and strategic suppliers in a disruptive innovation process, which is essential in order to meet commitments on reducing CO\u2082 emissions, improving air quality and finding more sustainable materials e.g., increased recycled content for use in our products.\n\n**Boost Efficiency**\n\nThe CSR commitments that the Company asks its suppliers to make, enables them to reduce their own operational risks. Suppliers are informed of best practices and regulatory changes and can benchmark themselves by comparing their CSR performance against the industry average. Being aware of opportunities to build on their strengths and implement action plans to work on weaknesses provides suppliers with a path to improvement. Stellantis monitors the progress of the action plans required from suppliers and helps them find solutions to improve their product quality or optimize their processes.\n\n**Boost Economic Performance**\n\nIn view of the demanding supplier selection process, being a strategic or core supplier of Stellantis demonstrates a high-level of economic and CSR performance. Through innovation partnerships with Stellantis, suppliers are developing a competitive edge. This distinguishes them from their competitors when bidding for contracts in other markets. They can create commercial opportunities with customers who, like Stellantis, regard CSR criteria as a key aspect of the supplier selection and listing process. The Company's suppliers are expected to communicate their own CSR commitment and performance, EcoVadis score, to their customers, stakeholders and in all host regions. Similarly, being chosen to support Stellantis on international projects, companies are boosting their prospects by increasing their presence and competitiveness in new markets.\n\n**Boost CSR Performance**\n\nThe Company\u2019s responsible purchasing approach drives attention to validated CSR performance from our suppliers. Our policy is to work with suppliers in a partnership to improve CSR performance overall. These expectations are an integral part of the supplier relationship and require a continuous focus to ensure we apply the needed resources to achieve top ranking status. This approach has created results that have Stellantis supplier CSR performance that is clearly above the EcoVadis benchmark.\n\n**Supplier Business Award and Third Party CSR Assessment**\n\nStellantis policy for all sourcing activity to award business to new and existing suppliers requires that CSR performance is systematically taken into consideration and globally reviewed. The goal is to ensure that responsible purchasing practices are in place with our selected suppliers and at an acceptable performance level. We seek to only award business to suppliers that share our values and can maintain required compliance and performance.\n\n**Industry Guidance**\n\nSupporting the development of the automotive industry is important to help make progress on common topics. Stellantis contributed on the revision of the Automotive Guiding Principles with AIAG and Drive Sustainability. This document seeks to create alignment between automakers to address issues relevant to the industry, and to speak with a unified voice on the importance of a sustainable, ethical supply chain. These documents are updated on a regular basis and work to move the message forward and align with the evolving expectations for the entire supply chain. For example, the upcoming regulations in Germany and the EU are primary new additions to the content that already covers various existing requirements. The automotive industry needs to take on the challenges that are necessary to build the appropriate expectations for all levels of the complex and multi-tiered supply network. Stellantis is committed to being a engaged partner in the development and promotion of these needed guidance materials.\n7.1.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nGRI 103-2\n\nResponsible Sourcing is primarily a function of the Global Purchasing and Supply Chain (GPSC) department (refer to 7.1.4).\n\nCSR activities are embedded into everyday life within the purchasing processes. Buyers are the primary point of contact for suppliers and required to work towards ensuring that all contractual obligations and expectations, such as the Responsible Purchasing Guidelines, are upheld. They communicate with suppliers to raise awareness on requirements and strive to ensure that supplier CSR performance, assessed by EcoVadis, is at the necessary level for the supplier to be considered in sourcing opportunities. EcoVadis assessments are required to be renewed annually and suppliers are subject to onsite audits from recognized assessment bodies based on risk assessments.\n\nSupplier discussions are critical for alignment and driving results. Annual Supplier Business Review meetings are designed to address many factors that include CSR topics. A designated program lead manages the overall process and official documentation. The supplier discussion is supported by a member of top management, at a minimum the head of the division, and the buyer.\n\nExperts are designated at various levels within the business units, including:\n\n- GPSC Champion is a senior executive who is responsible for considering CSR issues/challenges in the decision-making process;\n- CSR Correspondents are responsible for the reliable disclosure of qualitative and quantitative data within their scope;\n- Regional Contributors are the local contacts that provide the specific regional elements as required.\n\nWe collaborate and participate with stakeholders to address common and specific issues. We focus on developing and implementing solutions that drive efficiencies and build common industry tools. Often the actions needed from suppliers are common within the automotive industry and can be leveraged. Some of the collaboration areas include:\n\n- Internal departments such as engineering, logistics, industrial and program teams;\n- External stakeholders such as suppliers, OEMs and industry associations such as AIAG and VDA;\n- Service providers such as CDP and EcoVadis.\n\nFor more information on the achievements refer to 7.1.7.\n\nPurchasing CSR Resources Matrix\n\n| Resources and Tools | Responsible Sourcing | Human Rights in the Supply Chain | Climate Change - Carbon accounting |\n|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Supplier Business Review meetings | \u2714 | \u2714 | \u2714 |\n| Drive Sustainability | \u2714 | \u2714 | \u2714 |\n| CSR assessment, CMR, CRT, NQC subgroup, EcoVadis | \u2714 | \u2714 | |\n| RMI | \u2714 | \u2714 | |\n| Automotive Industry Associations ACEA, AIAG, ANFIA, PFA, VDA | \u2714 | \u2714 | \u2714 |\n| CDP | \u2714 | \u2714 | |\n| SGS Social Audits | \u2714 | \u2714 | |\n| RCS Global battery suppliers - supply chain transparency | \u2714 | | |\n| Conflict Minerals Program, Collaboration with Assent and NQC | \u2714 | \u2714 | |\n7.1.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nStellantis has many initiatives that focus on responsible purchasing practices to support the Company\u2019s development in host territories. The activities are designed to support local sourcing development while providing measures that mitigate risks from suppliers and subcontractors.\n\nThe Responsible Purchasing Guidelines addresses topics focused on; compliance with laws, regulations, social and ethical principles, environmental protection and sustainable procurement including training and support for small and local suppliers. Stellantis requests supplier signatures and ensure that they are aware of the expectations necessary to maintain the status of a Stellantis supplier. Suppliers are critical links in the chain of responsibility.\n\nIdentifying CSR risks in the supply chain\n\nStellantis uses risk analysis (mapping) to identify and prioritize actual or potential CSR incidents in the supply chain such as environmental, social and ethical topics. Where risk is identified, Stellantis has a prevention system to implement and monitor specific action plans with involved suppliers to prevent or mitigate any impact to the supply chain. If there is an impact, Stellantis takes necessary actions to solve it.\n\nThe Company is transparent about the measures taken and the results obtained which are published annually in our CSR report.\n\nRisk mapping\n\nWe have opted to identify CSR risk by commodity for both direct and indirect material purchases. The methodology used is built and incorporates third-party assessment ratings, such as EcoVadis Rating Framework:\n\n- CSR risk profiles on internal commodities were developed;\n- CSR risk profiles by country based on the EcoVadis list that includes 207 categories for 175 countries were developed;\n- supplier CSR performance assessments were entered in the EcoVadis database (currently more than 88,500 suppliers assessed, an increase of approximately 13,500 suppliers since last year);\n- collection of additional information from sources including unions, NGOs, media or data-collection specialists available for review.\n\nCritical suppliers are a tier 1/tier N supplier who could cause production stoppages at Stellantis plants or delay the sales launch of new vehicles. There are five categories of high-risk suppliers:\n\n- suppliers who are the only source of a product;\n- suppliers for whom Stellantis purchases represent over 30% of their annual revenue;\n- suppliers who are financially stressed;\n- suppliers whose failure to adhere to the Stellantis\u2019 CSR policy could damage the Company\u2019s reputation. These suppliers might cause a substantial negative impact on the environment, employment, human rights or society (particularly through unethical conduct);\n- suppliers who are located in high risk geographical areas\n\nFor 2021, about 28% of the tier 1 suppliers by number are considered as critical. Monitoring, mitigation and action plans are developed for these suppliers to implement a strategy customized for each case to protect Stellantis.\nCOMPANY TRANSFORMATION THROUGH THE SOFTWARE STRATEGY\n\nStrategic partnerships with leading companies continue to drive innovation, efficiency and shared know-how with Stellantis experts.\n\nAs an example, the new non-binding memorandum of understanding signed with Foxconn aims at developing four families of chips that will cover over 80% of the Company\u2019s micro-controllers\u2019 needs, helping to greatly simplify the supply chain. Adoption and installation of products into Stellantis vehicles is targeted by 2024.\n\nTo provide a more robust and stable supply of parts related to semi-conductors, Stellantis has been developing internal plans to address the major impact from supply disruptions experienced in the last few years. Stellantis has developed a task force to focus on the immediate need to resolve the chip shortages. This task force included Tier-1, as well as targeted sub-tier, suppliers. The outcome has provided an opportunity to develop a direct relationship with chip suppliers, which brings a more integrated view to the needs of Stellantis in the extended supply chain, where competition for scarce materials is high. These actions are meant to lower the risk for this commodity.\n\nFocus on raw material risks: a material risk mapping is regularly reviewed and updated in terms of the criticality of materials with specific characteristics, importance for competitiveness, little or no current alternative, potential scarcity due to limited global production or fragile supply chains and questionable CSR conditions e.g., conflict minerals, lithium, cobalt and mica. This mapping is designed to enable us to manage and secure our supply over a long-term period and focus our research and development work on alternative materials. Our policy to seek out new, innovative materials combines with our quest to increase the proportion of renewable and environment-neutral materials in our vehicles. This analysis supports our ability to focus on critical suppliers, such as those included in our battery supply chain for development and management.\n\nFocus on conflict minerals: earnings from mining gold, tin, tantalum and tungsten might be used to finance armed conflict in the Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries. In accordance with required U.S. and EU regulations, Stellantis\u2019 policy requires transparency from its suppliers about the origin of any raw materials and minerals they use. For more information refer to section 7.2.7.\n\nEnvironmental damage: this is damage caused to water, air and soil either as a result of natural disasters or industrial accidents, or due to overexploitation of natural resources. The focus on industrial supplier risks uses a mechanism that enables the buyer to quickly identify the Company\u2019s exposure to the risks linked to each supplier production plant, using a matrix which takes into account criteria such as: geographical location (risk of natural disaster), the Company\u2019s share in the plant\u2019s production, how specific the technology used by the supplier is, how many of the Company\u2019s vehicles are affected by production at this plant, etc. This assessment method is used systematically to prepare technical and industrial procurement policies for each product group and each call for tenders. This result is systematically taken into consideration in the supplier selection process globally.\n\n7.1.7.1. Actions to mitigate risks from subcontractors or suppliers\n\nAssessments of the supply chain by recognized assessment bodies\n\nTo support the supplier assessment process on CSR criteria and make it more robust, Stellantis has embarked on an assessment of its Tier 1 supply base using criteria related to the environment, workforce, ethics and subcontracting chain. It has outsourced this assessment to an independent external company, EcoVadis. The first step was to identify supplier risks more precisely. Stellantis informed its suppliers that this evaluation was a prerequisite for the placement of future business, and to remain on the supplier panel. Stellantis requires its existing suppliers to be reassessed each year to continuously improve their CSR performance. A corrective action plan is automatically required for suppliers that do not receive a score that meets the standards set by Stellantis.\nAudits of suppliers at risk\n\nIn addition to the CSR assessment, on-site audits are performed. These audits are conducted for suppliers identified as risky according to three CSR criteria: countries (non-signatory country or country with questionable governance), products (inherently risky, such as promotional items) or processes (manufacturing processes involving hazardous substances).\n\nThese social and environmental audits are also managed by an independent external service provider, SGS. An audit checklist is used covering the following topics:\n\n- CSR policy;\n- human rights;\n- working conditions;\n- workplace health and safety;\n- environment;\n- supplier CSR management system.\n\nThese audits provide a snapshot of how the supplier is performing in terms of the Company\u2019s reference guide and the local statutes and regulations. The specifications stipulate that local auditors who speak the language of the audited site and who have a thorough knowledge of the applicable local laws, regulations and practices applicable to the site must carry out the audit. The external auditor creates an audit report for each audit. The report describes noncompliances and grades them according to four classifications; critical, core, minor and observations only, each requiring corrective action plans. If no satisfactory solution can be found to a critical or core noncompliance, a disengagement plan may be put in place after consultation with internal individuals affected by the decision. If necessary, an audit may be conducted to verify that action plans were implemented.\n\nSuppliers and their production plants are expected to be IATF 16949-certified. The IATF standard meets the growing expectations of markets and governments in relation to ethical business practices. It also incorporates changes and complexities specific to the automotive sector, such as requirements for onboard software, and strengthening product traceability in accordance with regulatory changes. Stellantis has added additional specific requirements for this certification. These additions include adherence to the Responsible Purchasing Guidelines and they contain specific CSR advice and actions required by suppliers. IATF conducts audits to ensure compliance with these specific requirements.\n\nSteps taken to prevent risks: governance of the supplier relationship\n\nSupplier briefings are held each month to provide suppliers with CSR updates, communicate the Company\u2019s CSR expectations and inform them of legal and regulatory developments in CSR matters. Risk prevention takes place in the day-to-day relationship between buyers and suppliers. Stellantis pays particular attention to supplier training and provides them with tools that enable them to rapidly identify and react to risk situations. Suppliers have access to e-learning on CSR principles to evaluate and improve their CSR performance and how to build robust internal processes supporting CSR.\n\nTraining for buyers and suppliers\n\nThe supplier training curriculum covers subjects related to purchasing, quality, supply chain management, manufacturing, finance and engineering. There are dedicated classes on sustainability-related topics such as responsible working conditions, environmental impacts, ethics and conflict minerals. The Company\u2019s ambition is to train 90% of the suppliers in CSR risks and the Stellantis requirements by 2025.\n\nIn 2021 buyer training included 4 training events where more than 220 purchasing professionals attended and will offer additional training as the development of policies and tools are finalized for Stellantis.\n\n7.1.7.2. Monitoring signs of weakness to eliminate the causes of risk\n\nWhistleblowing channels\n\nStellantis reinforces that employees, suppliers, dealers, consumers and other stakeholders can and shall report any concerns of alleged situations, events, or actions that may have been inconsistent with the Stellantis Code of Conduct and request advice about the application of the Code. (refer to 5.1.4.1 for additional information).\nStakeholder feedback\n\nStellantis receives input from NGOs and actively collaborates with them on a partnership level. For example, we collaborate with selected NGOs on mica and leather programs. Additionally, a partnership with RCS Global, a responsible sourcing advisory and audit firm was established. In early 2020, former Groupe PSA formed a partnership with the RCS Global for a cobalt and lithium supply chain auditing program. Stellantis has expanded the scope to include additional suppliers and raw materials in 2021. (For more information refer to 7.2.7). The Company also reviews media and news reports on topics related to NGO findings on raw materials of all kind.\n\nMeasures taken if suppliers are found to be noncompliant with CSR requirements\n\nStellantis has introduced a comprehensive toolkit to measure the social and environmental performance of its suppliers and to identify any shortcomings or risks. The suppliers questioned or audited systematically receive an analysis of their performance. For suppliers who do not achieve the required standard, a corrective action plan is put in place. Suppliers that do not improve or collaborate with Stellantis might ultimately be excluded from the Stellantis\u2019s supplier panel.\n\n7.1.7.3. Supplier Risk and Engagement Achievements\n\nGRI 414-1  GRI 414-2\n\nAlready in our first year, Stellantis has had many positive results from the actions taken with our suppliers. Our list of achievements provides the details related to the performance of our efforts.\n\n- 93% of suppliers approved during sourcing for CSR compliance.\n- More than 2,561 supplier groups were assessed by EcoVadis and NQC, which accounts for more than 83% of the value of direct purchases\n  - 71% Overall Supplier Sustainability score which is classified as Good (ratings higher than 45 Points);\n  - 464 suppliers with corrective action plans which is 18% of the total assessed suppliers\n- 75 external social and environmental on-site audits.

WCM support included plant shop floor assessments for new launch suppliers and focused improvement activities for those supporting current production. To maximize the effectiveness of the program, suppliers and commodities are prioritized based on their impact on Stellantis plants, purchasing strategy and the supplier\u2019s current performance. Particular emphasis is placed on supplier plants involved in upcoming product launches. Dedicated WCM knowledge experts from Stellantis provide guidance and mentoring to improve supplier\u2019s key performance indicators and activities.\n\nSupplier programs that focus on fostering innovation to improve products, processes and content are essential for Stellantis. We may use different tools but it is the dedication of our employees that work with suppliers for value optimization and encourage a proactive approach to collaborate on cost saving ideas and technical solutions.\n\nOur suppliers participated in more than 10 Technology Day events both local and virtual. These events encourage collaboration with Stellantis personnel and suppliers on innovative solutions for features, efficiencies and quality, and allow suppliers to share their latest technological developments and concepts for the future.\n\nStellantis engages sub-tier suppliers by hosting Technology Open House events which allow Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers to present commodities, technologies or services to Stellantis audiences that they might not otherwise reach.\n\nA partnership that promotes sustainable performance: Supplier Awards\n\nThe Supplier Awards are an opportunity to reaffirm the strategic importance of the supplier relationship as a fundamental driver in achieving the Company\u2019s strategic plan for profitable growth and developing differentiating technological innovations in response to the challenges of global competitiveness. The Global Purchasing and Supply Chain Department rewarded the best suppliers in several categories. One of the categories is CSR Performance. The list of award-winning suppliers is validated by a committee to ensure that the suppliers are compliant with the assessment criteria in other categories. For example, a supplier cannot be given an award in the value-creation category unless it has reached the required CSR level. In 2021, 12 suppliers received awards for their commitment and quality of their response to the Company\u2019s expectations.\n\n7.1.8 DETAILED KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n7.1.8.1 Transparent communication on the results of due diligence\n\n2021 CSR Performance of the Company\u2019s suppliers assessed by the external service provider EcoVadis\n\nStellantis\u2019s suppliers performance %\n\n| Performance category                  | Compliant | Minor non-compliance | Core non-compliance |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Global Overall CSR score              | 71%       | 27%                  | 2%                  |\n| Environment                           | 71%       | 27%                  | 2%                  |\n| Labor and Human Rights                | 75%       | 24%                  | 1%                  |\n| Ethics                                | 60%       | 34%                  | 6%                  |\n| Sustainable Procurement               | 40%       | 49%                  | 11%                 |\n\n2021 EcoVadis assessment Key Performance Indicators\n\nCSR KPI - Responsible Sourcing\n\n| Policy on corruption                  | 72%       |\n| Active whistleblowing procedure in place | 51%       |\n| Audit or assessment of suppliers on CSR issues | 50%       |\n| Whistleblowing procedure on ethics     | 46%       |\n## Summary of 2021 Critical Supplier Audits\n\n| CSR Category                  | Sub-topics                                                                 | Observations | Minor non-compliance | Core non-compliance | Critical non-compliance | Total |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|-------|\n| Sustainability policy         | Sustainability policy                                                       | 3            | -                    | -                   | -                       | 3     |\n| Human rights                  | Uphold freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Elimination of any forms of forced or compulsory labor; Zero-tolerance of child labor; Elimination of discrimination in terms of employment and occupation; Anti-corruption measures and the prevention of conflicts of interest; Labor organization and disciplinary practice | 8            | 14                   | 48                  | 2                       | 72    |\n| Working conditions            | Remuneration; Working hours                                                 | 1            | 15                   | 80                  | 16                      | 112   |\n| Workplace health and safety   | Organization; Buildings; Fire Prevention; Machines/electrics; Hazardous substances; Canteen; Dormitories | 6            | 74                   | 116                 | 1                       | 197   |\n| Environment                   | General organization; Waste; Waste water; Air emissions; Soil; Water and energy consumption | 4            | 11                   | 6                   | -                       | 21    |\n| Management System             | Supply chain                                                                | 1            | 3                    | 3                   | 1                       | 8     |\n| Total                         |                                                                             | 23           | 117                  | 253                 | 20                      | 413   |\n7.1.8.2 Supplier Spend Analysis\n\nValue of Direct Material Purchases by Destination\n\n- **0.9%** MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA\n- **5.6%** SOUTH AMERICA\n- **43.2%** ENLARGED EUROPE\n- **50.1%** NORTH AMERICA\n- **0.2%** CHINA AND INDIA & ASIA\n\n7.2 HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN\n\n7.2.1 CONTEXT AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\n**CSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE #21: Human rights in the supply chain**\n\nExpectations from stakeholders are growing in terms of their interest to be informed about the origin of products and related production conditions for what they buy. It is crucial that we work to provide transparency throughout the supply chain, regardless of the difficulty to implement.\n\nManaging social, societal and ethical impacts in the supply chain is a core priority for Stellantis, given the extensive international expansion in emerging countries of our supply base. We intend to adhere to common, globally embraced environmental and social principles by working together to improve our supply base sustainability development. Enhancing transparency regarding raw material origin and human rights within our complex global supplier network is a high priority. We respect the responsibility we have for due diligence and the opportunity to be socially respectful within the extended enterprise. Stellantis focuses on improving supplier social performance and complying with social, societal and ethical standards in our supply chain.\n\n**Company\u2019s public position**\n\nAs a Global Compact signatory, the Company endorses the principles based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development and the United Nations Convention against Corruption.\n\nThe Company\u2019s commitment on human rights is based on the recommendations of the OECD guidelines and of the UN guiding principles for multinational enterprises, business and human rights.\n\nStellantis commits to implementing preventive measures to uphold human rights and ethical principles, meet social and ethical standards based on the International Labor Organization (ILO) rules for human rights such as child labor and forced labor, the OECD Guiding Principles and customer expectations considering the risks specific for the automotive supply chain. We also commit to adhering to the standards, norms and regulations defined by supranational bodies such as, ISO 26000, ISO 20400, ISO 14021, UK REACH, International Labor Organization and Global Compact. We adhere to the legislative requirements including the Duty of Vigilance, EU Conflict Minerals regulation, U.S. Dodd Frank Act and the Modern Slavery Act.\n\nWe integrate these standards into our internal processes to manage the risks incurred and the risks to stakeholders arising from our business activities with the extended supply network including the sub-tier suppliers.\n\nStellantis requires that forced or compulsory labor and child labor is not tolerated and is forbidden throughout the entire supply chain, including raw materials suppliers. We require that our suppliers also apply these standards rigorously.\n7.2.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\n| CSR ISSUE | VISION / AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | 2021 RESULTS |\n|-----------|-------------------|----------------|------------|--------------|\n| CSR issue #21 Human rights in the supply chain | Require, monitor and control the total respect for Human Rights along the entire global supply chain process, involving all actors to ensure transparency | Average Human Rights scores of Stellantis Tier-1 suppliers assessed by independent third party | Short-term: 2025: Increase of +2.5% vs score as of 01/01/21 | 2.7% increase in performance during 2021 |\n| Owner Chief Purchasing and Supply Chain Officer | | | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan): 2030: Increase of +5% vs score as of 01/01/21 | |\n| | | | Long-term: 2050: in top level performance category | |\n\n7.2.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nGRI 102-13  GRI 102-15  GRI 103-2  GRI 407-1  GRI 408-1  GRI 409-1\n\nHuman Rights and Forced Labor commitments\n\nStellantis is focused on Human Rights and the encouragement of appropriate attention from our entire supply network. An important aspect we address is the prohibition of child or forced labor within the extended supply chain. We create partnerships with providers that support actions to monitor the many layers within the complex extended supply network.\n\nParticipation on automotive industry work groups is part of our process to address the concerns of forced labor by bringing together expertise from cross functional teams. Customs and Sustainability teams from OEMs and suppliers are working together to help develop ideas and strategies (refer to 7.1.6).\n\nStellantis pays specific attention to the Human Rights section of the overall Responsible Sourcing topic.\n## RISK #1\n\n### Human Rights violations in the extended supply network\n\n**Risk Description**\n\nDue to the extended supply chain structure it can be complex to work towards ensuring the avoidance of human rights violations. Supply chain management based on continuous risk assessment with the objective of reducing exposure to risk and improving performance is a critical element for Stellantis\u2019 supply chain management programs. It is of high importance to work with suppliers that share the same objectives to support the elimination of human rights violations. We expect our suppliers to share the principles we live by and to cascade these principles throughout the extended supply network.\n\n**Potential Impact**\n\n- Violation of legislation in case of an incident (Duty of Vigilance) based on the need for local application in a global supply chain\n- Supply disruption due to strikes/social conflicts\n- Remediation costs to resolve issues found at any level of the extended supply chain;\n- Compensation to victims in the event of incidents\n- Loss of productivity and quality\n- Ethical breaches on supplier quality risks\n- Reputation risk - crisis of confidence in the event of a proven supplier failure\n- Declining Brand reputation that might impact sales\n- Additional measures may be required to secure supply (security stock/supplier dubbing)\n- Supplier removal from panel or bid\n\n**Mitigation Strategy**\n\n- Identify risk by commodity, country and industry for direct and develop plans for indirect material purchases\n- Based on EcoVadis Rating Framework\n- Commitment to the Global Compact and building on its Global Framework Agreement, which extends to suppliers and partners\n- Engagement with several multi-stakeholder organizations, both within and outside the automotive industry\n- Onsite audit activities\n- RCS Global - Battery suppliers\n- SGS - Social audits\n\n**Additional Opportunities**\n\n- Anticipating future regulations and the opportunity to improve the industry and our suppliers\n  - German 2022\n  - EU 2023\n- Supplier development through mentoring and training\n- Access to regulated markets on human rights aspects\n- Enhance corporate image among civil society\n- Improvements in Operational Management\n  - Productivity\n  - Better working conditions\n  - Reduced work-related accidents\n  - Reduced absenteeism and turnover\n  - Reinforcing the attractiveness of suppliers, particularly in emerging countries and improving skills within the supply chain\n## RISK #2\n\n### Regulated materials in the extended supply chain - Conflict Minerals compliance (3TG)\n\n| Risk Description |\n|------------------|\n| The extraction of raw materials for use in the manufacturing of goods and services for the automotive industry may lead to undesirable actions in some geographical locations. Funding armed conflict is a concern that requires due diligence to provide transparency regarding the origin of specific minerals, such as tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold. Through supplier assurance measures we seek to help put an end to the exploitation and abuse of local communities, including mine workers, while supporting local development. |\n\n### Potential Impact\n- Finance of armed conflict\n- Incidents of child, forced or compulsory labor in the sub-tier supply chain\n- Difficulty to secure supply of critical minerals\n- Reputation concerns\n  - Negative publicity\n  - Loss of investor confidence\n  - Negative brand association for future customers\n\n### Mitigation Strategy\n- Ethical and conscientious procurement practices during the mineral extraction, trade and processing stages\n- Conduct due diligence activities to provide supply chain transparency and smelter validation\n- Training to provide suppliers with Stellantis\u2019 expectations and tools and resources to supplier supplier development\n- Supplier Business Review meetings to reinforce the alignment of objectives and legal obligations to continue the ongoing relationship with Stellantis\n\n### Additional Opportunities\n- Use of 3TGs from verified \u2018conflict free\u2019 sources to support green and local sourcing initiatives\n- Redesign goods and services to eliminate the used of 3TGs\n- Vertical integration for secured mineral supply\n- Access to regulated markets on human rights aspects\n- Automate the process\n## RISK #2\n\n**Non-regulated materials in the extended supply chain - Cobalt, Mica, Bauxite/Aluminum, Nickel, Lithium, etc**\n\n### Risk Description\n\nThere are many materials that can become a focus item based on potential human rights violations. These types of raw materials used in the manufacturing of goods and services for the automotive industry may lead to detrimental behaviors in the extended supply chain. Often there are preliminary stages prior to official legislative measures that should alert users to concerning activity. It is essential to stay aware and engaged with multiple stakeholders to learn and to build resources. We seek to help put an end to the exploitation and abuse of local communities while supporting local development.\n\n### Potential Impact\n\n- Incidents of child, forced or compulsory labor in the sub-tier supply chain\n- Difficulty to secure supply of critical minerals\n- Reputation concerns\n  - Negative publicity\n  - Loss of investor confidence\n  - Negative brand\n\n### Mitigation Strategy\n\n- Ethical and conscientious procurement practices during the mineral extraction, trade and processing stages\n- Conduct due diligence activities to provide supply chain transparency and smelter validation\n- Training to provide suppliers with Stellantis\u2019 expectations and tools and resources to supplier supplier development\n- Supplier Business Review meetings to reinforce the alignment of objectives and legal obligations to continue the ongoing relationship with Stellantis\n- Ongoing partnership with RCS Global, a recognized organization that serves to support responsible mineral sourcing and works to deploy best practices.\n\n### Additional Opportunities\n\n- Redesign goods and services to eliminate the use of the subject material\n- Use of materials, such as cobalt, from verified \u2018conflict free\u2019 sources to support green and local sourcing initiatives\n- Vertical integration for secured mineral supply\n- Access to regulated markets on human rights aspects\n- Encourage industry discussion and focus on appropriate measures prior to legislation\n- Enhance corporate image among civil society\nElectrification relies on the raw materials necessary to produce battery components. The Stellantis Responsible Purchasing Guidelines requires battery suppliers to disclose their raw material suppliers. These materials can pose human rights risks in the supply chain particularly cobalt in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n2,561 supplier groups are covered by a CSR assessment performed by an external third-party including human rights criteria. Part of the expectation is that the management of the extended supply chain has appropriate measures to identify, mitigate and monitor potential human rights issues. Stellantis conducts an annual mapping for the source of essential materials for electric vehicle battery manufacturing. In 2021, we partnered with RCS Global to apply due diligence with our critical suppliers regarding cobalt and lithium supply chains by conducting 40 external on-site audits.\n\nNGOs identified that another material that the energy transition relies on, i.e. aluminum, also poses human rights issues. Drive Sustainability, a Stellantis partner, launched a project to identify human rights risks in the supply chains of 10 raw materials, including aluminum. In July 2021, Human Rights Watch issued a report on human rights violations risks in the aluminum supply chain, naming aluminum the \u201cblind spot\u201d of car companies due diligence policies. Therefore, the description of the impact of electrification on human rights in the supply chain should not only refer to materials such as cobalt and lithium, but also to aluminum.\n\nThese activities improve our ability to address human rights risks in its supply chain where they may exist (refer to 7.1.3).\n\n7.2.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nOur Conflict Minerals program is managed by regional and subsidiary conflict minerals team members. A global lead provides overall program management and consolidation direction to ensure that corporate obligations are fulfilled. The Stellantis conflict mineral supplier submission status is tracked and communicated by the purchasing organization to ensure that any needed escalation efforts are deployed quickly. The purchasing commodity directors are involved in escalation activities with the supply base, as needed, to reinforce the importance of providing due diligence evidence to support Stellantis\u2019 legal requirements. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings are regulatory documents that companies must submit to the SEC annually to show the efforts taken to determine the mine or location of origin with the greatest possible specificity. Suppliers who are required to submit the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template must provide it within the appropriate time period or be considered as non-compliant. If a supplier is found to be non-compliant they may be recommended for removal from the sourcing panel.\n\nOn-site audit program management\n\nThere are protocols in place to manage audit activities. We hold meetings with the service providers to ensure the programs are progressing and any issues or concerns are addressed. If a critical non-compliance is found the supplier is flagged for additional escalation activities and appropriate purchasing management members are notified. At the close of the audit a formal debrief is conducted to share the findings with the supplier. Depending on the findings, after the debrief individual follow up is made to ensure that corrective action plans are implemented, if required a follow-up audit is performed to have the necessary evidences of implementation. Internally we review the audit activities and results with top purchasing management and when appropriate suppliers with exemplary results are recognized by the purchasing team.\n\nDiversity and Inclusion focus programs\n\nWe work to include diversity and inclusion considerations as an everyday practice in our dealings with employees, dealers, suppliers and customers. Training, mentoring, scholarship support, sponsorship and membership with Board and committee participation are some of the ways we support various diversity organizations. Diversity spend targets are created for suppliers based on diversity categories. Performance is captured as a strategic indicator on the Global External Balanced Scorecard, which can be used in sourcing decisions.\n\nTo receive credit towards their diversity goals, a supplier is required to work with certified diversity tier-2 suppliers. The diversity spend status of each supplier is monitored and reviewed with them. The High Focus program works with the suppliers that have a greater potential for diverse spending and equips them with tools and support to achieve their diversity targets.\n\nSheltered and adapted sector\n\nCommitment for the social and occupational inclusion of people with disabilities is an important segment to Stellantis. We have dedicated resources that support the organization at the national level, with a focus in France and Spain. Specific budgets and processes are set and managed to ensure attention on this segment.\n7.2.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nStellantis combined the former Conflict Minerals policy and the Responsible Purchasing Charter used for example in the PSA organization into the Responsible Purchasing Guidelines (see section 7.1.5).\n\nThe topic of human rights is reinforced in many documents such as the Modern Slavery Act Statement and the Non-Financial Information section of the Annual Report which includes the Duty of Vigilance.\n\nStellantis\u2019 focus areas for human rights in the extended supply chain\n\nIATF Certification\n\nStellantis suppliers are required to complete our customer specific requirements which includes adherence to our Responsible Purchasing Guidelines, Corporate Social Responsibility recommendations and required actions. The certifying bodies for IATF conduct audits regarding these specific requirements. The IATF 16949 certification is granted for three years with an annual monitoring audit. Certification is suspended and additional audits are conducted if there are core compliance failures so that corrective actions can be implemented.\n\nOnsite Auditing\n\nOnsite audit activities are performed by certified auditors from distinguished external assessment bodies (see section 7.1.7 for further details). Currently we have partnered with SGS for these audit activities. Guidance is provided via program documentation that includes the supplier kick-off notification, audit checklist and closure debrief. Any non-compliance requires an improvement plan. During the closing meeting the supplier receives the auditor findings and is required to sign-off on any improvement plans. These plans are monitored to ensure that the identified concerns are resolved. Additional follow-up visits may be required to confirm evidence onsite.\n\nWhistleblowing\n\nStellantis reinforces that employees, suppliers, dealers, consumers and other stakeholders can and should report any concerns of alleged situations, events or actions that may be inconsistent with the Stellantis Code of Conduct. They can also request advice about the application of the Code of Conduct.\n\nWe are committed to act in a socially responsible manner that is in line with sustainable practices within Stellantis and at each level of the supply base including ensuring the health and safety of the workforce, prohibiting child and forced labor, complying with conflict minerals and adhering to environmental protection regulations (see section 5.1.4.1).\n7.2.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nFor detailed information on which resources are available in Stellantis to ensure Responsible Purchasing, refer to section 7.1.6 to see the overview.\n\nMonitoring potential human rights violations within the Stellantis supply chain requires internal and external resources. The most prominent areas of concern regarding human rights can be many layers deep within the complex automotive supply network. Even though Stellantis may not have a direct contractual relationship with these entities, we recognize our responsibility to provide appropriate due diligence for materials that are critical and may be provided from conflict affected and high risk areas. There are designated individuals that perform multiple internal activities such as extracting critical data from internal systems, developing and managing the needed campaigns, reporting the status to top management and providing program management oversight for our service providers.\n\nConflict Minerals Program Management\n\nThe conflict minerals program management team is responsible for generating the annual in-scope supplier list that identifies which suppliers are required to provide the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT). The list of parts for products containing tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold is provided from regional technical contacts upon request. The International Material Data System (IMDS) is a global data repository that contains information on materials used by the automotive industry and this, or an equivalent system, is used to provide the part content information.\n\nOnce the Conflict Minerals data collection process begins, the designated members are required to track supplier submissions and provide updates so that progress reports can be presented to the purchasing management team. If a supplier is unresponsive they will be placed into the escalation process which includes notifying the buyer and their management as appropriate.\n\nService Providers\n\nMany of the service providers that support our Responsible Purchasing activities have focused elements that are specific to identifying and addressing human rights violations. We have partnered with RCS Global and are an active member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). Both of these organizations are recognized providers that conduct onsite audits throughout the supply chain including tier 1 suppliers as well as mine sites. This is another way that we fulfill our duty to adhere to the high expectation of vigilance.\n\nRCS Global\n\n- Mapping battery supply chain to gain greater transparency;\n- on-site audits in the sub tier supply chain levels;\n- expanded materials of focus;\n- utilization of tools such as the Vine data base;\n- increase in scope for materials of focus to address materials used in EV batteries.\n\nResponsible Minerals Initiative (RMI)\n\n- Engagement with multiple work groups;\n- use of the Smelter database to support our Conflict Minerals filing;\n- Risk Readiness Assessment (RRA) promotes common understanding of good practices and a means to consistently assess risks in mineral supply chains;\n- Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP) is an assessment that employs a risk-based approach to validate smelters\u2019 company-level management processes for responsible mineral procurement;\n- Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT) is an essential tool to gather information about the source of materials in our products, and the smelters and refiners that process the materials;\n- Cobalt Reporting Template (CRT) is a standardized reporting template developed to identify choke points and collect due diligence information in the cobalt supply chain;\n- Material Insights interactive module to update the prior Material Insights report.\n\nWe are members of many automotive industry associations. For example, we participate with four regional organizations, ANFIA, PFA, VDA, and AIAG and the multi-national partner Drive Sustainability. For more information, see section 7.2.7.\n7.2.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nGRI 102-13  GRI 102-33  GRI 102-34  GRI 103-3\n\nInitiatives to support the respect of human rights in the supply chain\n\nGRI 407-1  GRI 408-1  GRI 409-1  GRI 414-1  GRI 414-2\n\nStellantis incorporates workforce-related and social criteria into the purchasing process to ensure our focus on human rights is upheld within the extended global supply chain. Our suppliers are expected to sign and apply the requirements from our Responsible Purchasing Guidelines which has specific attention on compliance with social and ethical principles.\n\nThe Stellantis Responsible Purchasing Guidelines (see 7.1.5 and 7.1.7) is based on the recommendations of the OECD.\n\n- A public commitment to human rights;\n- Risk mapping for human rights infringements;\n- Preventive measures to address identified risks;\n- Corrective action must be taken for suppliers potentially or currently involved in a human rights infringement;\n- Action plan monitoring;\n- Communication of measures put in place.\n\nStellantis identifies the regions and areas that have the largest risk of human rights violations and modern slavery.\n\nThe regions and areas at risk are identified based on two criteria:\n\n- country (countries that have not signed up to global agreements, countries ill-equipped to enforce international laws);\n- manufacturing process (whether it requires a significant amount of low-skilled labor and additionally is dangerous).\n\nBased on this, the Company applies a graduated reasonable efforts approach. This might result in removing a supplier from the panel or bid if it should become evident that it was directly or indirectly involved in this type of practice. It is the Company\u2019s policy to assist and guide suppliers so that they can improve. However, if they are clearly unwilling to make changes, Stellantis reserves the right to cease all contact and to remove them from its supplier database.\n\nPracticing due diligence\n\nStellantis applies due diligence to ensure that its social demands are met by its suppliers. We follow the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for our supply chain which comprises reasonable due diligence measures to identify risks and prevent serious infringements of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and personal and environmental health and safety, arising from the activities of subcontractors or suppliers with whom there is an established business relationship. The measures put in place by the GPSC aim to ensure that suppliers fulfill social and environmental commitments. The plan supports identification, prevention and mitigation of the risks of noncompliance and failure to comply with basic human rights. The plan also provides the option to perform on-site audits.\n\nStakeholder engagement: Through engagement with several multi-stakeholder organizations, both within and outside the automotive industry, Stellantis seeks to address not only the needs, but the opportunities that exist through ethical and conscientious procurement practices during the mineral extraction, trade and processing stages. Stellantis collaborates with automotive and cross-industry associations to develop the global extended supply chain and build resources that support due diligence activities.\n\nStellantis has specific legal obligations, section 1502 of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act and the new EU regulation, that must be met regarding the country of origin for conflict minerals. We are required to conduct due diligence to determine whether tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold in the supply chain originated from the covered countries, and whether the procurement of those minerals supported armed conflict in the region. This issue is not unique for Stellantis and working to build industry resources is beneficial for us and our suppliers that are often common among automotive manufacturers.\n\nStellantis is a member of Drive Sustainability. This association provides greater engagement with other OEMs, as well as access to additional tools and resources. In 2021 we worked to revise the Guiding Principles which outline expectations for suppliers on key responsibility issues including human rights, environment, working conditions and business ethics.\nIn the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG) Corporate Responsibility Steering Committee, Stellantis was elected co-chair of the Responsible Minerals workgroup which leads auto industry engagement in cobalt, mica and conflict minerals activities and relationships. Stellantis employees are engaged in a number of other AIAG teams that partner automakers with suppliers. New groups are launched to address industry issues such as the Forced Labor and Human Rights team that brings together volunteers from diverse departments with specific backgrounds such as Customs and CSR experts.\n\nOur membership with the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), which was founded by members of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative, supports cross-industry discussion and development of common tools. Participation on RMI sub-teams facilitates development of best practices for supply chain assurance mechanisms. We work closely with RMI and its Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP). The RMAP uses an independent third-party assessment of smelters and refiners\u2019 management systems and sourcing practices to validate conformance with RMAP standards. The assessment employs a risk-based approach to validate smelters and refiners\u2019 company-level management processes for responsible mineral procurement.\n\nThrough our work with diverse stakeholder organizations we are helping to build fair supply chains of minerals in the covered countries.\n\nFocus on conflict minerals: earnings from mining gold, tin, tantalum and tungsten might be used to finance armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries. In accordance with required U.S. and EU regulations, Stellantis\u2019 policy requires the utmost transparency from its suppliers about the origin of any raw materials and minerals they use. A specific clause, article 16.2.3, is inserted in the purchase contract for battery suppliers, stating that the supplier must disclose the detailed composition of the materials used to manufacture the parts supplied, as well as any changes in that composition. This requirement complies with the \u201cDevoir de Vigilance\u201d legislation. The supplier must also provide the written information necessary to comply with the legislation in force, particularly on consumer protection and conflict minerals. The Purchasing Department identifies the in-scope suppliers to include in the annual Conflict Minerals reporting campaign.\n\nStellantis has access to a wide range of information and data from RMI that supports our efforts to ensure that sustainability standards are implemented by smelters and the mining industry. The Company has access to the RMI smelter database, assurance process and all the latest information and training materials available to support appropriate due diligence to promote responsible raw material supply chains. The Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT) that is provided by the RMI is requested from the in-scope suppliers using the 3TG metals (tungsten, tantalum, tin and gold). If there are concerns regarding the sourcing of raw materials, the suppliers have to address the concerns and potentially set up alternative sources. The Company thus seeks to exercise its duty of care and foster sustainable procurement.\n\nThe Conflict Minerals reporting process begins by determining the in-scope suppliers that have parts that contain tantalum, tin, tungsten or gold, based on part data from the International Material Data Sheets (IMDS). A response to the CMRT is then required from more than 680 in-scope direct and after-market suppliers in order to obtain smelter information.\n\nFurther, we:\n\n- expect our suppliers to source materials from suppliers who also source responsibly, including from legitimate, conflict-free mines in the covered countries;\n- require relevant suppliers make reasonable efforts to conduct the necessary due diligence and provide us with proper verification of the country of origin and source of the materials used in the products they supply to Stellantis;\n- support initiatives to verify smelters and refiners that are conflict-free and expect our suppliers to utilize any such conflict-free smelter/refiner programs that are available;\n- review all incoming CMRT submissions from our suppliers;\n- provide detailed smelter analysis to suppliers reporting non-conformant smelters in their supply chain.\n\nTo prepare suppliers for submitting information Stellantis provided training for the targeted suppliers regarding the completion and submission of the CMRT.\nWe strive to ensure companies or individuals in legal business activities are not harmed by our efforts to avoid using minerals that are illegally obtained. To this end, we work to promote sourcing from responsible sources in the region. Stellantis also engages with industry and cross-sector groups to promote and develop our raw material supply chain focusing on, but not limiting our efforts to, commodities such as cobalt and mica.\n\n**Cobalt and others:** Cobalt is of growing interest for the auto industry due to its use in electric vehicle batteries. Stellantis has taken action to engage suppliers regarding cobalt in their products given the ongoing concerns around the use of child labor in the mining of cobalt. Expanding into new materials relies on the lessons learned from our Conflict Minerals process in addition to applying industry tools and resources.\n\nUtilizing and teaching our suppliers the OECD 5-Step Framework for Upstream and Downstream Supply Chains provides a common foundational tool that helps solidify responsible sourcing practices and decisions made throughout our supply chain. In addition, cross-sector engagement brings together experts from numerous industries to use their global presence and leverage to drive ground-level improvements in the mining of metals and minerals through process, tool and infrastructure improvements.\n\nTo help companies address these challenges, the RMI has developed the Risk Readiness Assessment, which addresses environmental, social and governance risks present in the global supply chain. This tool can help improve supply chain transparency and mapping to mitigate undesirable practices as they relate to Conflict Minerals, cobalt and other raw materials. RMI has also collaborated with the Responsible Cobalt Initiative on a joint cobalt refiner audit program, aligned with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance and the Chinese Due Diligence Guidelines for Mineral Supply Chains.\n\nIn 2021, Stellantis extended its partnership with the responsible sourcing advisory, traceability technology and audit firm RCS Global, for a multi-material supply chain program covering battery materials including cobalt, lithium, graphite, and nickel. The program continues the groundbreaking work of the predecessor Company (PSA) in 2020 which identified the origin of raw materials, human rights risks, and due diligence conformance of the Stellantis supply chain.\n\n2021\u2019s supply chain is support by Vine \u2013 RCS Global\u2019s online due diligence management platform for supply chain traceability and supply chain visualization. Stellantis is an early supporter of Vine, which allows the company to identify, review and analyze sustainability risks and respond rapidly to critical risks where they are identified.\n\nMica represents another area of concern for child labor. It is used predominantly in surface coatings and contained in other vehicle materials, such as in polymers for exterior mirror housing and covers. Stellantis has been a supporter of the 2021 release of the Global Workplace Standard for Mica Processors which addressed social obligations covering a range of labor practices such as; age of employment, fair working hours, minimum wages and overtime, grievance mechanisms, freedom of association and diversity provisions, including women\u2019s rights and under-represented communities. RMI will initiate audits for mica processors under the RMAP and create a list of conformant processors.\n\nHuman rights impacts are a concern due to the mining practices deployed to harvest the mineral Bauxite, which is used in aluminum production. In an effort to raise awareness and reinforce the automotive industries focus on human rights in the supply chain the members of Drive Sustainability collaborated to send a letter to the European Aluminum Association and to The Aluminum Association in the U.S. regarding Bauxite mining in Guinea. The message expressed our commitment to protect human rights in the aluminum automotive supply chain.\n\n**Achievements**\n\nMore than 220 Purchasing employees trained on Human Rights policies or procedures.\n\n**CSR Performance**\n\n- With an average overall Human Rights section score of 53.2, suppliers working with Stellantis outperformed all suppliers assessed by EcoVadis, who have an average score of 46.6;\n- 333 assessed or audited suppliers for which corrective action plans have been developed for Human Rights issues, which is 13% of the total assessed or audited suppliers.\nConflict Minerals reporting\n\n- More than 250 smelters have been validated as low risk;\n- more than 230 smelters and refiners have been validated as conforming to the RMAP or cross-sector recognized standards;\n- 92% in-scope suppliers for parts containing tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold have submitted the required CMRT.\n\nStatus\n\n- 5.8% IN PROCESS\n- 2.1% NO RESPONSE\n- 92.1% COMPLETED\n\nRCS Global audits\n\n- Completed audits: 40 on-site audits of companies at every tier of Stellantis\u2019 cobalt and lithium supply chains (battery manufacturer, cathode manufacturer, refiner, treatment unit, and mine site). Audit scope: cobalt, lithium, nickel and graphite;\n- Accepted Corrective Action Plans: 40;\n- Identified suppliers: >550;\n- Number of Country of Origin (for mine site): 14\n  - Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), China, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Russia, Turkey, Australia, Brazil, U.S., Indonesia, Canada, Finland, Chile and Argentina.\n\nThe results put Stellantis in a good position to significantly address human rights risks in its supply chain where they exist.\n\nBusiness with the sheltered sector\n\nStellantis is committed to helping our suppliers maintain their policy of inclusion of handicapped workers. Promoting equal opportunity in the workplace is vital to Stellantis\u2019 human resources management and the Company\u2019s long-term success. A wider, more diverse pool of talent improves the Company\u2019s understanding of our workforce and our customers. Stellantis works with six major French associations: Adapei in Doubs, Adapei in Haute-Sa\u00f4ne, Bretagne Ateliers, Adapei Papillons Blancs in Alsace, Les Ateliers de l\u2019Ostrevent, the AMIPI/SLAMI Foundation together with Spanish association ILLUNION.\n\nThe services bought from the adapted and sheltered sector added up to \u20ac48 million.\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\nStellantis is focused on empowering equal employment opportunities based on merit without regard to race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, age, protected veteran status, marital status, religion, national origin, disability status, genetic information or other basis protected by law. We work to include diversity and inclusion considerations as an everyday practice in our dealings with our employees, our dealers, our suppliers and our customers. Stellantis believes the diversity of our suppliers should reflect the diversity of our workforce and the communities in which we do business. Stellantis provided support to organizations that included DisabilityIN where the focus is on empowering business to achieve disability inclusion and equality.\n\nStellantis spent more than \u20ac6.56 billion with Tier 1 and Tier 2 diverse suppliers in 2021. The Stellantis U.S. suppliers\u2019 External Balanced Scorecard includes a metric for diversity sourcing at the Tier 2 level. The diversity spend status of each supplier is monitored monthly and reviewed with them quarterly.\n\nRecognition of the diversity efforts the Company has made are presented throughout the year. These awards honor corporations for diversity programs that reduce barriers and drive growth for suppliers that are appropriately certified with approved councils.\nStellantis U.S. received the following awards for our focus on diversity during 2021:\n\n- Top 8 Supplier Diversity Program out of 1,800 USA based companies - DiversityInc;\n- WBENC Best In Class Corporation Award;\n- GLWBC Best In Class Corporation Award;\n- VOBRT Corporation of the Year Award;\n- NVBDC President\u2019s Award;\n- NMSDC Corporation of the Year Nominee;\n- MMSDC Corporation of the Year Nominee;\n\nStellantis also supported inclusion across our supply base through the North American 22nd annual Matchmaker event, which creates opportunities for diverse suppliers. Matchmaker events provide minority-owned, women-owned and veteran-owned businesses access to our Tier I suppliers and to decision makers within our procurement organization.\n\nIn 2021, more than 900 people attended the virtual event gaining access to 90% of the purchasing leadership and over 200 buyer professionals.\n\nTraining, mentorship, scholarship support, sponsorships, membership and Board and committee participation are some of the ways we support organizations, which include:\n\n- Billion Dollar Roundtable;\n- National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce;\n- National Minority Supplier Development Council;\n- DisabilityIN;\n- Canadian Aboriginal and Minority Supplier Council;\n- Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council;\n- WECONNECT International;\n- Michigan Hispanic Chamber of Commerce;\n- National Business League (Former Michigan Black Chamber);\n- Asian Pacific American Chamber of Commerce;\n- Michigan Minority Supplier Development Council;\n- Veteran Owned Business Roundtable;\n- Rainbow Push;\n- DisabilityIN;\n- Great Lakes Women\u2019s Council Conference;\n- National Veteran Business Development Council;\n\n### CSR KPI - Labor and human rights\n\n| KPI                                                                 | Percentage |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Actions on employee health and safety issues                        | 68%        |\n| Reporting on health and safety indicators                           | 60%        |\n| Global Compact Signatory                                            | 41%        |\n| Tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold and their derivatives (i.e. \u201cconflict minerals\u201d) necessary to the functionality or production of products | 38%        |\n7.3 PHILANTHROPIC ACTIONS TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES\n\n7.3.1 CONTEXT AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\nCSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE #22: Philanthropic actions to support communities\n\nAs a corporate citizen, Stellantis wants to make a positive contribution to society in the countries where we operate. We want to share with our communities our values, knowledge and resources through our philanthropic actions. The world is changing very fast due to the impact from many major events. Stellantis wants to mitigate the significant impact on people in their day-to-day lives and more specifically on people who have fewer options due to limited resources. We aim to support these people through mobility and educational projects and empower them while inspiring hope.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nStellantis, as a member of the Global Compact, promotes company commitments to play a role in building a more stable, inclusive and sustainable society. By mobilizing financial and human resources to help Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO), Non-Profit Institutions (NPI) and support employee initiatives, we can develop and deploy philanthropic projects of general interest adapted to the specific needs of the communities in which we operate. The projects we implement are designed to have a positive impact in these communities.\n\n7.3.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\nFollowing the merger of former Groupe PSA and FCA, in January 2021, Stellantis is currently reorganizing its philanthropic activity. During this transitional year, Stellantis committed to previous engagements. In 2022, Stellantis discloses its new philanthropy strategy focused on needs of vulnerable people in the communities where we operate: Driven by our societal commitment, we empower people through access to mobility and education.\n\nThe first implementation phase of this strategy and associated commitments will start in 2023.\n\n| CSR ISSUE | VISION / AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | 2021 RESULTS |\n|-----------|-------------------|----------------|------------|--------------|\n| CSR issue #22 | Driven by our societal commitment, we empower people through access to mobility and education. | Amount of budget for philanthropy | Short-term: 2023: at least \u20ac15 million dedicated to philanthropy + all philanthropic projects focused on the new philanthropic strategy\u00b9 | Stellantis managed the former commitments from the legacy charitable entities |\n| Owner Chief Communication and CSR Officer | | | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan): 2030: at least \u20ac15 million dedicated to philanthropy + at least one philanthropic project in each region\u00b9 | |\n| | | | Long-term: 2038: at least \u20ac15 million dedicated to philanthropy + at least one philanthropic project in each region and for each philanthropic focus areas\u00b9 | |\n\n\u00b9Amount decided on a yearly basis, based on assessment of Stellantis and general economy financial trend, and benchmark with OEM involvement in philanthropy.\n### 7.3.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n| Risks | Mitigation | Opportunities |\n|-------|------------|---------------|\n| **Business risk**<br>Certain countries where we have strategic plans to operate or current operations require philanthropic activities to fulfill contractual legal expectations.<br>The risk is to support projects that are not adapted to the community priorities and are not socially impactful. | \u25aa Stellantis philanthropic organization supports projects only in the countries where we operate.<br>\u25aa A local dedicated team ensures the building and the follow-up of the project.

After the merger of former Groupe PSA and FCA in 2021, Stellantis managed the transition to the new philanthropic focus. We continue to support multi-year projects that started before the merger. The legacy charitable entities managed their former commitments on the basis of their previous governance. In Stellantis, the Chief Communication and CSR Officer is in charge of Philanthropy. The 2021 year was dedicated to the redesign and reorganization of the philanthropy department and activities including working on proposals for a new governance structure. The new philanthropy program will be announced in 2022.\n\n2021 KEY FIGURES\n\n- \u20ac14.4 mln Dedicated to philanthropy projects\n- 100 Philanthropic projects supported\n- 6,249 Hours volunteered by employees\n\nFondation PSA was a French corporate foundation founded in 2011 with a mandate for five years. The Board of Directors of Fondation PSA was composed of nine members, two founders, four representatives of former Groupe PSA entities and three independent experts. The General Delegation of Fondation PSA was a team led by a General Delegate who reported to the former Group PSA Communications Department. The process to choose qualified NGO donees used calls for projects, however in 2021, in the context of the merger, Fondation PSA did not launch any call for projects. For each project supported, Fondation PSA worked closely with each organization to ensure the use of the donations and required a final report on the social impact of the project with key indicators previously identified. Since the Fondation PSA mandate came to an end on June 18, 2021, the Fondation Board of Directors did not renew the mandate and proceeded with its dissolution.\n\nFCA charitable giving was conducted using a combination of corporate and foundation funds. FCA Foundation operated the majority of the FCA charitable activities. FCA Foundation primarily supported U.S. activities, while also funding occasional non-U.S. grants. A Board of Trustees consisting of corporate executives governed the FCA Foundation. The Trustees also served as the CSR Steering Committee and approved the corporate charitable giving budgets, recipients and funding organization. FCA Foundation worked closely with each grantee and required a final report with the social impact of the project. FCA Foundation had an invitation only application process. The FCA U.S. External Affairs Department managed the FCA Foundation.\n\n7.3.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nStellantis made 2021 a year of transition by fulfilling the philanthropic commitments made prior to the merger of former Groupe PSA and FCA.\n\nFormer Groupe PSA, mobility was considered an important global societal challenge and a fundamental right. Mobility has an effect on everyone\u2019s lives and is a key driver for economic development and social welfare. It underpins independence, progress and innovation. As a company who delivers mobility solutions and backed by our expertise, Fondation PSA was focused on mobility projects that were useful to the community. Fondation PSA demonstrated its commitment to socially responsible mobility by providing support to projects that use mobility to:\n\n- promote social inclusion and strengthen social ties;\n- expand access to culture and education, refer to 7.3.7 for more details.\n\nThe projects supported by Fondation PSA were put forward by public interest organizations around the world with special emphasis on former Groupe PSA areas of expertise. Support given to organizations located close to the former Groupe PSA employee pool strengthen the bond between our host communities and us.\nFCA Foundation was aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The social contributions focused on education to empower people and build resilient communities with effects that can extend generations into the future. Investments were made in programs that generated meaningful and measurable impact for:\n\n- education from early childhood to employment development skills, with an emphasis on STEM, literacy education improvement and problem-solving and in youth development;\n- social-emotional support, providing young people with tools to face life\u2019s challenges to reach their dreams and full potential.\n\nFCA Foundation and corporate giving initiatives and charitable contributions were made to support local community needs in the countries where FCA operated. Donations were made in healthcare, disaster relief, environment protection and conservation, veterans support and community events.\n\nIn addition to monetary contributions, Stellantis encourages employees to address the societal needs of the communities in which they live and work through employee volunteerism programs. During 2021, although COVID-19 significantly impacted volunteer opportunities, 1,117 employees around the world were able to support 47 projects representing more than 6,249 hours of working time. These programs focused on quality education and creating sustainable cities and communities. For more details on the projects supported, see section 7.3.7.\n\nAs the philanthropic strategies of former Groupe PSA and FCA were different, a new philanthropic focus is being established for Stellantis as part of its strategic core purpose with a dedicated philanthropic organization to be put in place: \u201cPowered by our diversity, we lead the way the world moves\u201d. The philanthropic strategy will be defined after the release of the Stellantis strategic plan.\n\n### 7.3.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nStellantis has a diversified approach to corporate citizenship and uses different types and categories of donations to support communities in the most efficient way. In 2021, many Stellantis entities, under the control of the philanthropy team, donated to NGOs or non-profit organizations to help the people in need in the communities where we operate. Depending on the goals of the project proposed by NGOs, the donations may be annual or multi-year.\n\n#### Stellantis contributions to support communities\n\n(in \u20ac)\n\n| 2021 | Monetary contributions | In-kind giving | Working time spent volunteering by employee | Overhead expenses | Total | % |\n|------|------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------|-------|---|\n| Charitable donations | 5,836,917 | 107,731 | 216 | 763,234 | 6,708,098 | 44% |\n| Community investments | 1,546,279 | 2,870 | - | - | 1,549,149 | 10% |\n| Commercial initiatives in partnership with charities | 5,832,088 | 872,962 | 206,227 | - | 6,911,277 | 46% |\n| Total | 13,215,285 | 983,563 | 206,442 | 763,234 | 15,168,524 | 100% |\n\n% | 87% | 6% | 1% | 5% | 100% |\n7.3.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nStellantis intends to have philanthropic initiatives that are designed to make the world and society a better place. In 2021, in the context of the merger, Stellantis has focused its projects on mobility and education philanthropic initiatives. These projects were engagements prior to the merger. The Stellantis achievements support our focus to create positive social and environmental impacts.\n\nTotal monetary values of philanthropic contributions and number of projects by geographical areas\n\n7.3.7.1 Socially responsible mobility projects\n\nFondation PSA supported organizations that are active in rural communities or in outlying urban areas and who work closely with social agencies and local authorities to implement socially responsible mobility solutions for people referred to the organizations by local social services. The goal was to remove mobility obstacles for the unemployed to receive training or find a new job. The mobility service experience former Groupe PSA gained with partner associations allowed the identification of new stakeholders, new needs of disadvantaged people and new vehicle usage models, other than ownership, to test the effectiveness of new business models for mobility services. These actions contribute mainly to two Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs), SDG 10 Reduced inequalities and SDG 11 Sustainable cities and communities. Fondation PSA was recognized as an expert in socially responsible and inclusive mobility solutions.\nStakeholders dialogue on mobility\n\nSince 2014, Fondation PSA participated in the work of the Laboratoire de la Mobilit\u00e9 Inclusive (LMI) with key players including companies or corporate foundations such as TotalEnergies Foundation, Fondation Macif, SNCF, Transdev, Malakoff Humanis; NGOs such as Secours Catholique, the Red Cross and FACE; and institutions such as P\u00f4le Emploi, FASTT, CNML - the central and local government consultative body, and ADEME. The mission of the LMI is to advise on inclusive mobility issues mainly relating to individuals with integration needs; such as seniors and people in isolated rural and outlying urban areas. The LMI also works with players from the social and solidarity economy to trial mobility services and present the mobility needs of the less fortunate to French authorities.\n\nMobility projects for social inclusion\n\nLa Mobilit\u00e9 en partage is a shared mobility project in rural areas that was co-created with Emma\u00fcs in 2017. An innovative approach to tackle the instability linked to a lack of mobility was initiated. The program created a network of mobility contributors and beneficiaries and developed strong local ties with stakeholders in French rural areas. The evaluated social impact of this three-year self-sufficient and unique experiment showed that a sustainable economic model is possible for an inclusive mobility system. This project was expanded to Pontivy (France) in 2021, in another Emma\u00fcs entity.\n\nMobility projects to promote access to Education and Culture\n\nSince 2015, Fondation PSA supported the Petite Galerie project of the Louvre museum. This partnership improved access to culture. The Petite Galerie project is a multidisciplinary space primarily for school groups. A touring exhibition stemming from the Petite Galerie project is part of this program. Former PSA industrial site workers are usually the first to see the exhibit escorted by a tour guide. The touring exhibitions are displayed in secondary schools, universities and shopping centers providing the opportunity for a wide range of audiences to hear about the exhibition. In 2021, the new exhibition \u201cFrom afar: travelling materials and objects\u201d tells the tale of the world and its people by describing exchanges between distant worlds from before the explorations of the 16th century.\n\nStellantis continues its support through Fondation PSA to the Ecole de Production. These schools prepare young people who were confronted to school failure, to obtain professional diplomas. The Company provided support with financing driver\u2019s licenses, raising awareness of road safety and purchasing vehicles to promote their mobility. In 2021, there were 228 driver\u2019s license trainings funded of which 76 students received their driver\u2019s license and 15 vehicles were co-financed. Through the program\u2019s partnership, in 2020, the first electric vehicle repair-training program was created at the ECAUT Production School for 20 students. This training provided young people with additional skills to enter the labor market.\n\n7.3.7.2 Socially responsible educational projects\n\nLiteracy\n\nSince 2019, FCA Foundation has supported teaching fellows in disadvantaged public schools in Italy in partnership with Teach for Italy. The program is a partnership with the Italian Ministry for Education, the Turin and Cuneo Provincial Education Authorities and the Tuscan Regional Education Authority. Our grant enabled Teach For Italy to launch its fellowship program and start its operations in Italy. We helped address early school dropout rates and strengthened the Italian education system by investing in innovation and new talent, starting with the most disadvantaged schools in the country. The multi-year grant allowed Teach for Italy to operate in 13 high-need schools in four Italian provinces (Turin, Cuneo, Prato and Rome). In the 2021-2022 school year, the program expanded to 35 fellows impacting almost 3,000 students in 35 schools. The grant also made it possible to prepare fellows for the classroom through a six-week Summer Institute Training program.\n\nStellantis recognizes that reading is key to learning and the importance of education in helping youth reach their full potential. That is why Stellantis, through its FCA Foundation, teamed with Beyond Basics to provide 22 Detroit (U.S.) high school students with intensive reading intervention and literacy enrichment. Professional tutors were matched with students who received five hours in the six-week one-on-one program during class time. In the 2020-2021 school year, the program exceeded its goal that 86% of students improve at least one reading grade level or reach their current grade level, as students improved an average of two grade levels.\nScientific Education\n\nUnveiled in 2019 in Geneva, Switzerland, CERN is a Science Gateway project, a hub for scientific education and culture. In 2021, CERN held a first stone ceremony attended by Stellantis Chairman John Elkann, as the next step in the creation of the Science Gateway. Supported by the FCA Foundation, the ambitious and innovative Science Gateway project is expected to raise awareness, curiosity and passion for science in every dimension for the most people possible. CERN will offer a variety of spaces and activities, with exhibitions explaining the secrets of nature, the very small elementary particles and the very large structure and evolution of the universe. The exhibitions will feature CERN's accelerators, experiments and computing, how scientists use them in their exploration and how CERN technologies benefit society. Hands-on experimentation will be a key part of the Science Gateway's educational program, allowing visitors to experience first-hand what it is like to be a scientist. The immersive activities available in the Science Gateway will foster critical thinking, evidence-based assessment and use of the scientific method, which are important tools in all walks of life.\n\nSTEM\n\nFCA Foundation has supported Math Corps, a six-week summer math and peer mentoring program for Detroit (U.S.) public school students, since 2018. Over the last three years, Foundation grants have supported 1,000 students in the program focused on teaching mathematics while fostering self-worth, strong values and a sense of family. Led by faculty from Wayne State University, students receive personalized tutoring, with an average 50% increase in pretest to posttest scores after just one summer, and with an average of 95% of students going on to college.\n\nEmployment development skills\n\nThe Advanced Manufacturing Career Academy at Southeastern High School was launched at the beginning of the 2020 fall semester by FCA in partnership with Detroit Public Schools Community District and the City of Detroit (U.S.) This is an education-career pathway program that helps students jump-start their careers in advanced manufacturing and information technology. In 2021, with over 200 ninth grade students enrolled in the program, FCA worked closely with Southeastern High School leadership and the Office of Career and College Readiness to support the Introduction to Advanced Manufacturing curriculum with guest speakers from the Manufacturing and Engineering Departments.\n\nPolitecnico di Torino Training and Collaboration was first established in 1999. Stellantis, through FCA, continues its collaboration with Politecnico di Torino, investing in education, training and research. The degree program in Automotive engineering now includes lessons with experts in sustainable mobility and artificial intelligence. The agreement encompasses international programs and helps prepare engineers to understand the society for which they are designing, through critical thinking, social responsibility. A total of more than 1,500 students graduated from the Automotive engineering degree program since it launched. 98.3% of students graduated found a job.\n\nWingyaan program was launched in 2019, which means \u201cknowledge provides wings to people\u201d. Stellantis has continued to support this program, which is a Girl Education and Employability Promotion program, in Pune, India. This program has supported 60 girls between 16 and 19 years old from rural areas since 2019. The girls who were unable to pursue further studies due to social and economic conditions had the opportunity after a two year training program, to obtain a Diploma in Automobiles and Manufacturing Excellence. With this combination of academics and job training, Stellantis gave these girls the opportunity to find employment in the manufacturing and service sector. In 2021, the second group of 30 girl students began the program.\n7.3.7.3 Socially emotional projects\n\nProfessional and social inclusion\n\nWith the support of Stellantis, the project of Vozes Daqui continues. It was launched in 2019 near the Company\u2019s plant in Goiana (Brazil). The aim of the project is to offer youth in municipal schools the opportunity to become more active in school and the community while increasing their physical activity and social skills. The project serves nine public schools in the city of Goiana. The schools are selected based on the most critical needs of strengthening the bonds of social inclusion. Despite COVID-19, the project succeeded in renovating two libraries and a sport court. The program benefits approximately 450 students, 25 teachers and managers and 40 community leaders and residents.\n\nMentoring program\n\nFCA Foundation supported Big Brothers Big Sisters of Metropolitan Detroit (U.S.) one of the oldest and largest youth mentoring organizations in the U.S. Employees were paired with elementary students in metropolitan Detroit for one-on-one virtual mentoring sessions during the 2020-2021 academic year engaging in fun and challenging activities. Since the launch of the program, employees have provided more than 800 volunteer hours to help youth facing adversity. Because of this program, 83% of children are expected to graduate from high school and go on to college as a result of having a supportive mentor.\n\nStellantis, together with the non-profit association Instituto \u00c1rvore da Vida, supports \u00c1rvore da Vida (Tree of Life) the social project in the Jardim Teres\u00f3polis community, near the Stellantis plant in Betim (Brazil). The program, which began in 2004, aims to promote social, cultural and economic growth of independence and empowerment of local residents while providing support for the children and their families. In this after-school project there are two main areas of focus, one is professional inclusion and the other is social inclusion through cultural development. Children ages 2 to 17 participated in various training programs to prepare them for professional development and employment. The children also participated in cultural activities such as music classes and choir. Youth learn collaboration, teamwork, public speaking and other soft skills. 2021 marked the 17th anniversary of this project. More than 23,300 people have benefited from the program since its inception.\nAPPENDIX\n\n8.1 REPORTING SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY 304\n8.1.1 methodology for building the CSR reporting perimeter 304\n8.1.2 Breakdowns of information provided 305\n\n8.2 INDEXES 306\n8.2.1 TCFD 306\n8.2.2 SASB 307\n8.2.3 ISO 26000 309\n8.2.4 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) content index 311\n8.2.5 UN Global Compact principles index with related GRI codes 322\n8.2.6 DPEF 326\n\n8.3 VIGILANCE PLAN 330\n8.3.1.

Reference guides specifying the methodologies, definitions and calculation procedures are used by the reporting contributors to ensure the quality and consistency of the consolidated information. Unless otherwise indicated, all data presented in the Report refers to the International System of Units and may be subject to rounding.\n\nInformation presented in this report, follows a Pro Forma approach which has been prepared to give effect to completion of the merger of PSA and FCA to create Stellantis, which was completed on January 17, 2021, as if it had been completed on January 1, 2020.\n\nThe normalization factor for manufacturing activities adopted in sections 2.6, 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6 is 5,687 thousand vehicles produced.\n\nIn this Report, unless otherwise specified, the terms \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, \u201cits\u201d, \u201cCompany\u201d and \u201cStellantis\u201d refer to Stellantis N.V., together with its subsidiaries and its predecessor prior to the completion of the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. with Peugeot SA or any one or more of them, as the context may require.\n\n8.1.1 METHODOLOGY FOR BUILDING THE CSR REPORTING PERIMETER\n\nThe CSR scope of reporting is set up from the financial scope of reporting.\n\nThe CSR scope of reporting covers the fully consolidated companies (consolidated line by line) and does not consider entities accounted for by the equity method or valued at cost in the consolidated financial statements, except where noted.\n\nSelected entities or specific sites are excluded from the scope of reporting for some CSR issues. This is attributable to the inability to obtain data of satisfactory quality, or to immateriality in relation to the Company as a whole, or to newly-acquired entities or activities that are not yet fully operational, in the start up phase, under dismissal or sold during the reporting year. For this reason, to determine the CSR scope of reporting, different filters are applied.\n\nFor more information on Stellantis entities included in the consolidated financial statements, refer to the 2021 Annual Report, available on the website at this link.\n\nFor environmental-related information included in sections 2.6 and 6.3-6.7 of this Report, the following definitions are applied:\n\n- manufacturing: relates to plants activities and includes also proving grounds and technical, R&D and ICT centers;\n- retail: relates to Company-owned sales and after-sales activities, retail offices (such as import subsidiaries) and logistics activities (spare parts warehouses and distribution centers).\n\nThe sites included in the definitions above, are assessed to determine the inclusion in the scope of reporting against specific thresholds based on: number of employees working onsite, size (m\u00b2) and other criteria.\n\nA selection of sites in the Retail group, apply a different reporting period (November 1 - October 31) to allow data collection and validation by the time of the release of this Report.\n\nInformation related to vehicles and services offered to customers, such as those presented in sections 2.5 and 4.1-4.3 of this Report, may include data on vehicles produced and/or service offered by unconsolidated joint ventures.\n\nReferences to \u201ccustomer\u201d as used in this Report refer to the end user of our products or services.\n\nFor human resources-related information included in section 3, unless stated otherwise:\n\n- workforce related KPIs do not include 2,101 employees representing 0.7 percent of the total headcount, because they belong to legal entities that are not managed within the HR consolidation tool;\nconversely, one entity representing 83 employees is included, while it has been sold at the end of 2021;\n\n- in addition, close to the end of 2021 the Company established and acquired a group of entities, fully consolidated from an accounting perspective, for which - due to timing constraint - Stellantis was not able to collect information for any of the workforce related KPIs. In 2022, Stellantis will strive to include these new entities in the relevant workforce related KPIs.\n\n8.1.2 BREAKDOWNS OF INFORMATION PROVIDED\n\nSegments\n\nStellantis activities are carried out through six reportable segments: five regional vehicle segments and Maserati. These reportable segments reflect the operating segments of the Company that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer, who is the \u201cchief operating decision maker\u201d, for making strategic decisions, allocating resources and assessing performance, and that exceed the quantitative threshold provided in IFRS 8 \u2013 Operating Segments (\u201cIFRS 8\u201d), or whose information is considered useful for the users of the financial statements.\n\nThe Company\u2019s five regional vehicle reportable segments deal with the design, engineering, development, manufacturing, distribution and sale of passenger cars, light commercial vehicles and related parts and services in specific geographic areas:\n\n- North America (U.S., Canada and Mexico);\n- South America (including Central America and the Caribbean islands);\n- Enlarged Europe (primarily the countries of the European Union, United Kingdom and Russia);\n- Middle East and Africa (primarily Turkey, Morocco, Egypt and Algeria) and\n- China and India & Asia Pacific (Asia and Pacific countries).\n\nThe Company\u2019s global luxury brand reportable segment, Maserati, deals with the design, engineering, development, manufacturing, worldwide distribution and sale of luxury vehicles under the Maserati brand.\n\nOther activities includes the results of our cast iron and aluminum components business, our financial services activities, as well as the activities and businesses that are not operating segments under IFRS 8.\n\nThe breakdown by segments is adopted in a limited set of data within this Report.\n\nGeographical Areas\n\nIn order to simplify the understanding of the reader, the majority of information is provided considering the geographical distribution of where activities are located to reflect where impacts occur.\n\nFor this reason, the Maserati and Other sectors\u2019 information are realigned into the 5 geographic areas:\n\n- North America (U.S., Canada and Mexico);\n- South America (including Central America and the Caribbean islands);\n- Enlarged Europe (primarily the countries of the European Union, United Kingdom and Russia);\n- Middle East and Africa (primarily Turkey, Morocco, Egypt and Algeria) and\n- China and India & Asia Pacific (Asia and Pacific countries).\n### 8.2 INDEXES\n\n#### 8.2.1 TCFD\n\nThe following table provides the

March 2017 on the duty of vigilance, the vigilance plan set out in this section includes reasonable measures of vigilance designed to identify risks and prevent serious breaches of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to ensure the health and safety of persons and of the environment, arising from:\n\n- the activities of subcontractors or suppliers (supply chain),\n- the operation of the Company and its subsidiaries,\n- the use of products and services marketed by the Company.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nWhile building its materiality matrix, the Company identified 6 macro-risks, divided into 22 CSR issues. The Company relied on an external third party to ensure fair and rigorous rating of each of the 22 CSR issues according to a uniform methodology.\n\nAnalysis of CSR risks were carried out with a double materiality approach: both potential impacts of the Company\u2019s activity on the stakeholders (including the environment) and impacts of external environmental and social factors on the Company\u2019s activity were considered and assessed.\n\nThe findings were submitted to Company\u2019s stakeholders\u2019 appraisal through interviews of a representative sample of our customers, employees, investors, suppliers and communities, identified based on their credibility and relevance toward our activities. Stellantis materiality matrix has been approved by the Board of Directors, prior to the public release of the Annual Report. The materiality matrix is also detailed in this CSR Report (for more information refer to section 1.2.2).\n\n12 out of the 22 CSR issues were selected to be included in the vigilance plan, according to the following rule.\n\nA CSR issue is included in the vigilance plan if:\n\n- it has an impact on human rights and fundamental freedoms (HR) and/or on the health and safety of persons (H&S) and/or on the environment (ENV), in compliance with the French law on the Duty of vigilance; and\n- it is classified as \u201cStrategic CSR issue\u201d or \u201cSignificant CSR issue\u201d in Stellantis\u2019 materiality matrix (see section 1.2.2).\n\nThe 12 CSR issues selected to be included in the vigilance plan are split within the 3 perimeters of activities:\n\n| SUPPLY CHAIN | OPERATION OF THE COMPANY | USE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES |\n|--------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| ENV CSR issue #3: Carbon footprint of supply chain: Purchasing and Logistics | HR CSR Issue #4: Management of company transformation and social dialogue | ENV CSR Issue #1: Vehicle CO\u2082 emissions |\n| HR ENV H&S CSR Issue #20: Responsible purchasing practices to support the company\u2019s development in host territories | HR CSR Issue #6: Diversity and equal opportunity | H&S CSR Issue #10: Vehicle safety |\n| HR H&S CSR Issue #21: Human rights in the supply chain CSR | ENV CSR Issue #2: Industrial and sites carbon footprint | ENV H&S CSR Issue #14: Wise use of material |\n| ENV H&S CSR Issue #17: Control of industrial discharges and nuisances | ENV CSR Issue #15: Vehicle impact on air quality |\nTo ensure transparency, Stellantis presents for each of these CSR issues the successive measures of its vigilance plan:\n\n**Measure No. 1:** Risk mapping designed to identify, analyze and classify risks\n\n**Measure No. 2:** Procedures for regular assessment of the situation in connection with risk mapping\n\n**Measure No. 3:** Appropriate actions to mitigate the risk of or to prevent serious breaches (and remediation plan when relevant)\n\n**Measure No. 4:** A mechanism for alerting and for gathering reports on the existence or materialization of risks\n\n**Measure No. 5:** A system for monitoring measures implemented and for assessing their effectiveness\n\nInformation included in this section refers to the 2021 Financial Year. Additional information on matters included in this Vigilance Plan is publicly available in the various sections of the 2021 CSR Report.\n\n### 8.3.1. THE ACTIVITIES OF SUBCONTRACTORS OR SUPPLIERS (SUPPLY CHAIN)\n\nStellantis has a direct contractual relationship with more than 2,000 tier-1 suppliers in direct material, with a supply base in 60 countries and worldwide purchase value of more than \u20ac82 Billion (7.1.3).\n\n#### CSR ISSUE #3: Carbon footprint of supply chain: Purchasing and Logistics\n\n| Measures | Process, main actions and results |\n|----------|----------------------------------|\n| 1: Risk mapping designed to identify, analyze and classify risks | \u2022 Stellantis uses risk analysis (mapping) to identify and prioritize actual or potential CSR incidents in the supply chain such as environmental topics.  \n  \u2022 We have opted to identify CSR risk by commodity for both direct and indirect material purchases. The methodology used is based on and incorporates third-party assessment ratings, such as EcoVadis Rating Framework:  \n    \u2022 supplier CSR performance assessments entered in the EcoVadis database.  \n    \u2022 more than 88,500 suppliers have been assessed on their CSR performance in the EcoVadis database, an increase of approximately 13,500 suppliers vs 2020.  \n    \u25aa in 2021, the average environmental score in EcoVadis of Stellantis suppliers was 53.4, outperforming all suppliers assessed by EcoVadis, which had an average score of 43.8. In 2021, 2,561 supplier groups were assessed, corresponding to more than 80% of the Annual Purchased Value.  \n    \u2022 collection of additional information from sources including unions, NGOs, media or data-collection specialists available for review. |\n| 2: Procedures for regular assessment of the situation in connection with risk mapping | \u2022 Stellantis is utilizing the CDP Supply Chain module as CDP is the most recognized global carbon accounting initiative and has the biggest network and impact. CDP is an organization which supports companies to disclose environmental impacts. It aims to make environmental reporting and risk management a business norm, and drive disclosure, insight and action towards a sustainable economy. This initiative promotes awareness among suppliers of their impact on the climate, particularly regarding greenhouse gas emissions and provides detailed information on the suppliers\u2019 level of emissions as well as reduction targets and commitments. This program allows to understand deeply several aspects including the management, the targets and the results of individual CO\u2082 emissions of all major CO\u2082 emitting suppliers of Stellantis.  \n  \u2022 Stellantis is collecting a status report from its major suppliers on their current and future CO\u2082 emissions and implementing a reduction plan by inviting them annually to participate in the Stellantis CDP Supply Chain program.  \n  \u25aa 265 suppliers have been invited to participate to the CDP Supply Chain module in 2021, with a response rate of 84% and an average score C  \n  \u2022 Stellantis\u2019 climate change objectives are translated into contractual commitments according to the CO\u2082 emissions generated and the type of materials used. |\n\n1Art L225 - 102 - 4 - 1 of the French Commercial Code requires a Vigilance Plan comprises these 5 measures\n### Measures\n\n| Process, main actions and results |\n|----------------------------------|\n| **3: Appropriate actions to mitigate the risk of or to prevent serious breaches (and remediation plan when relevant)** |\n| - Selection of suppliers according to environmental criteria such as: |\n|   - the ISO 14001 certification, or the capacity of suppliers to develop products which incorporate green or recycled materials. |\n|   - In 2021, 62% of direct material suppliers have ISO 14001 certifications available. |\n|   - The compliance with the Paris Agreement to define and track alignment with a clear roadmap of how to attain carbon neutrality target. |\n|   - By 2025, Stellantis aims to have 80% of its Annual Purchased Value (APV) coming from suppliers with CO\u2082 reduction trajectories compliant with the Paris Agreement. The share is then expected to increase to 95% by 2030 and to contribute to the carbon net zero with single-digit % of compensation objectives in 2038. |\n|   - as of 2021, more than 55% of our most important suppliers (based on APV) commit to a CO\u2082 reduction trajectory which complies with the Paris Agreement. |\n|   - In case of insufficient performance or nonconformities, suppliers are requested to report on their actions in Corrective Action Plans, that get shared with Stellantis and monitored. |\n|   - A specific policy is defined to reduce GHG emissions from logistics and identify areas of improvement and actions needed. |\n|   - In order to secure the supply of critical materials needed to produce LEVs, it is necessary to have supporting contracts and relationships with our supply chain to procure the needed raw materials which will also reinforce the strategy for emissions reduction. |\n|   - Stellantis, as of 2021, is engaged in joint innovation projects with 29 suppliers to identify and implement technologies that reduce CO\u2082 emissions of the vehicles as well as in the production of parts |\n| **4: A mechanism for alerting and for gathering reports on the existence or materialisation of risks** |\n| Refer to the paragraph \u201cReporting concerns - Integrity Helpline\u201d within section 8.3.4. |\n| **5: A system for monitoring measures implemented and for assessing their effectiveness** |\n| - Stellantis\u2019 climate change objectives are translated into contractual commitments via specifications and purchasing policies according to two different criteria: the CO\u2082 emissions generated and the type of materials used. Regarding CO\u2082 emissions linked to the Company\u2019s purchases from suppliers, the Purchasing and Supply Chain Division challenges its suppliers to establish and work according to an emission reduction plan at least compliant with the Paris Agreement and to be aligned with Stellantis climate ambitions. |\n| - In 2021, 49% of the Company\u2019s suppliers set up a reporting process for energy consumption or greenhouse gas emissions. Stellantis is placing particular emphasis on CO\u2082 emissions linked to some specific commodities covering around 80% of the CO\u2082 emission footprint of the supply chain. |\n| - Furthermore, suppliers also have a key role to play in our commitments on reducing hazardous substances in two main areas: first, the elimination of four heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium), and second, compliance with REACH regulations based on the recommendations issued by ACEA, of which Stellantis is a member. |\n| - Stellantis also created a specific environmental network in the Logistics Department to focus on the reduction of the logistics carbon impact and waste reduction roadmap |\n### CSR ISSUE #20: Responsible purchasing practices to support the company\u2019s development in host territories\n\n| Measures | Process, main actions and results |\n|----------|----------------------------------|\n| 1: Risk mapping designed to identify, analyse and classify risks | Stellantis uses risk analysis (mapping) to identify and prioritize actual or potential CSR incidents in the supply chain such as environmental, social and ethical topics. Where risk is identified, Stellantis has a prevention system to implement and monitor specific action plans with involved suppliers to prevent or mitigate any impact on the supply chain. The Company identified the following potential risks in the supply chain among others:  \n  - complexity of extended supply chains: we might face concerns regarding human rights violations, market tensions, geopolitical disruptions, natural disasters and availability of natural resources, among others.  \n  - environmental impacts from operations and natural disasters within the supply chain: starting from raw materials through to the production of goods and services, environmental impacts need to be appropriately addressed with robust standard operating procedures.  \nWe have opted to identify CSR risk by commodity for both direct and indirect material purchases. The methodology used is based on and incorporates third-party assessment ratings, such as EcoVadis Rating Framework:  \n  - CSR risk profiles on internal commodities were developed.  \n  - CSR risk profiles by country based on the EcoVadis list that includes 207 categories for 175 countries were developed.  \n  - supplier CSR performance assessments were entered in the EcoVadis database. |\n| 2: Procedures for regular assessment of the situation in connection with risk mapping | Stellantis implements an approach based on continuous risk assessment with the objective of reducing exposure to risk:  \n  - To support the supplier assessment process on CSR criteria and make it more robust, Stellantis has embarked on an assessment of its Tier 1 supply base using criteria related to the environment, workforce, ethics and subcontracting chain supplier. It has outsourced this assessment to an independent external company, EcoVadis. The first step was to identify supplier risks more precisely. Stellantis informed its suppliers that this evaluation was a prerequisite for the placement of future business, and to remain on the supplier panel. Stellantis requires its existing suppliers to be reassessed each year to continuously improve their CSR performance.  \n  - more than 88,500 suppliers assessed in 2021, an increase of approximately 13,500 suppliers since 2020.  \n  - The selection of suppliers is based on their adherence to social, ethical and environmental principles while maintaining high standards of quality and taking care of the communities where we do business.  \n  - ISO 14001 certification of suppliers is conducted via a Sustainability Assessment Questionnaire review  \n    - In 2021, 62% of direct material suppliers have ISO 14001 certifications available.  \n  - Audit activities are conducted to confirm compliance and discover areas for development and improved performance via an action plan.  \n  - To make sure that our principles are duly met, we conduct targeted audits where risks are identified.  \n  - These audits are conducted for suppliers identified as risky according to three CSR criteria: countries (non-signatory country or country with questionable governance), products (inherently risky, such as promotional items) or processes (manufacturing processes involving hazardous substances).  \n  - The external auditor creates an audit report for each audit. The report describes non-compliances and grades them according to four classifications: critical, core, minor and observations only, each requiring corrective action plans.  \n  - An audit checklist is used covering CSR policy, working conditions, workplace health and safety, environment, and supplier CSR management system.  \n  - 35 audits performed by SGS for Tier 1 supplier social and environmental audits in 2021. |\n### Measures\n\n#### 3: Appropriate actions to mitigate the risk of or to prevent serious breaches (and remediation plan when relevant)\n\n- Stellantis follows the due diligence approach advocated by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Company has set up its Responsible Purchasing Guidelines in compliance with International Labor Organization (ILO) rules. In this guideline, the Company encourages its suppliers to be vigilant for CSR risks within their supply chain.\n- Stellantis has a direct contractual relationship with more than 2,000 tier-1 suppliers in direct material. It requires all of them to meet the CSR commitments set out in its Responsible Purchasing Guidelines.\n- Supplier briefings are held each month to provide suppliers with CSR updates, communicate the Company\u2019s CSR expectations and inform them of legal and regulatory developments in CSR matters.\n- Stellantis has introduced a comprehensive toolkit to measure the social and environmental performance of its suppliers and to identify any shortcomings or risks. The suppliers questioned or audited systematically receive an analysis of their performance. A corrective action plan is automatically required for suppliers that do not receive a score that meets the standards set by Stellantis.\n- Suppliers that do not improve or collaborate with Stellantis might ultimately be excluded from the Stellantis\u2019s supplier panel.\n- CSR performances are measured by EcoVadis, an independent rating agency that specializes in responsible purchasing, Stellantis business clients can therefore demonstrate their own commitment to responsible purchasing.\n  - Targets on % Annual Purchase Value (APV) purchased from Tier 1 suppliers evaluated on CSR are:\n    - 2025: 90% of APV of direct material (parts)\n    - 2030: 95% of APV of direct material (parts) and 75% of APV of indirect material\n    - 2050: Maintain 95% of APV for direct material and reach 90% APV for indirect material\n  - 2021 results are:\n    - 2,561 Tier 1 suppliers groups were assessed by EcoVadis and NQC, which accounts for more than 83% of the value of direct purchases\n    - 71% Overall Supplier Sustainability score is classified as Good (ratings higher than 45 Points);\n- The supplier training curriculum covers subjects related to purchasing, quality, supply chain management, manufacturing, finance and engineering. There are dedicated classes on sustainability-related topics. The Company\u2019s ambition is to train 90% of the suppliers in CSR risks and the Stellantis requirements by 2025.\n  - In 2021 buyer training included 4 training events\n  - More than 80% of suppliers trained on Stellantis CSR risks and requirements.\n\n#### 4: A mechanism for alerting and for gathering reports on the existence or materialisation of risks\n\n- Stellantis reinforces that employees, suppliers, dealers, consumers and other stakeholder can and should report any concerns of alleged situations, events, or actions that may have been inconsistent with the Stellantis Code of Conduct\n- Stellantis receives input from NGOs and actively collaborates with them on a partnership level.\n  - For example, we collaborate with selected NGOs on mica and leather programs. Additionally, a partnership with RCS Global, a responsible sourcing advisory and audit firm was established.\n  - The Company also collect additional information from sources including unions, NGOs, media or data-collection specialists available for review.\n  - In addition of the elements mentioned just before, also refer to the paragraph \u201cReporting concerns - Integrity Helpline\u201d within section 8.3.4.\n### CSR ISSUE #21: Human rights in the supply chain\n\n| Measures | Process, main actions and results |\n|----------|----------------------------------|\n| 1: Risk mapping designed to identify, analyse and classify risks | Mapping of material risks for both current and forecasts, is performed according to specific criteria for each raw material. Some of the criteria include:  \n- significant contribution to develop existing technologies.  \n- scarcity and geographic location.  \n- social and environmental impacts including recyclability and extraction or production conditions.  \n- geopolitical or logistic accessibility.  \n- cost and share of Stellantis needs compared to global market demand and market players.  \nStellantis uses risk analysis (mapping) to identify and prioritize actual or potential human rights incidents in the supply chain.  \n- We have opted to identify human rights risk by commodity for both direct and indirect material purchases. The methodology used is based on and incorporates third-party assessment ratings, such as EcoVadis Rating Framework:  \n  - human rights risk profiles on internal commodities were developed.  \n  - human rights risk profiles by country based on the EcoVadis list that includes 206 categories for 144 countries were developed.  \n  - supplier human rights performance assessments were entered in the EcoVadis database.  \n  - Stellantis is an early supporter of Vine - RCS Global online due diligence management platform for supply chain traceability - which allows the Company to identify, review and analyze human rights risks and respond rapidly to critical risks where they are identified.  \n  - Stellantis is working to increase transparency of relationships throughout the extended supply network by partnering with service providers for supply chain mapping  \n  - In 2021, Stellantis extended its partnership with the responsible sourcing advisory, traceability technology and audit firm RCS Global, for a multi-material supply chain program covering battery materials including cobalt, lithium, graphite, and nickel. |\nStellantis has been a supporter of the 2021 release of the Global Workplace Standard for Mica Processors, used predominantly in surface coatings. This Standard addressed sustainability-related topics such as responsible working conditions and conflict minerals.\n\nIn addition to the human rights assessment, on-site audits are performed on suppliers at risk by certified auditors from distinguished external assessment bodies. In 2021, the increase in performance is of 2.7%.\n\nTargets on average Human Rights scores of Stellantis Tier-1 suppliers are:\n\n| Process, main actions and results | Measures |\n|----------------------------------|----------|\n| 2: Procedures for regular assessment of the situation in connection with risk mapping | \u2022 To help companies address these challenges, the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) has developed the Risk Readiness Assessment, which addresses environmental, social and governance risks present in the global supply chain. This tool can help improve supply chain transparency and mapping to mitigate undesirable practices as they relate to Conflict Minerals, cobalt and other raw materials.  \n\u2022 To support the supplier assessment process on human rights criteria and make it more robust, Stellantis has embarked on an assessment of its Tier 1 supply base using criteria related to workforce and subcontracting chain. It has outsourced this assessment to an independent external company, EcoVadis.  \n\u2022 With an average overall Human Rights section score of 53.2, suppliers working with Stellantis outperformed all suppliers assessed by EcoVadis, who have an average score of 46.6.  \n\u2022 Based on EcoVadis assessment, there are 333 suppliers for which corrective action plans have been developed for human rights issues, which is 13% of the total assessed or audited suppliers.  \n\u2022 In addition to the human rights assessment, on-site audits are performed on suppliers at risk by certified auditors from distinguished external assessment bodies.  \n\u2022 In 2021 we have partnered with SGS for these audit activities. Guidance is provided via program documentation that includes the supplier kick-off notification, audit checklist and closure debrief.  \n\u2022 In 2021, with RCS Global, we apply due diligence on human rights with our critical suppliers regarding cobalt and lithium supply chains by conducting external on-site audits.  \n\u2022 75 external social and environmental on-site audits conducted and 40 audits by RCS Global for the battery supply chain from Tier 1 to mine sites.  \n\u2022 Stellantis suppliers are required to complete our customer specific requirements which includes adherence to our Responsible Purchasing Guidelines, Corporate Social Responsibility recommendations and required actions. |\n| 3: Appropriate actions to mitigate the risk of or to prevent serious breaches (and remediation plan when relevant) | \u2022 2,561 supplier groups are covered by a CSR assessment performed by an external third-party including human rights criteria. Part of the expectation is that the management of the extended supply chain has appropriate measures to identify, mitigate and monitor potential human rights issues. Stellantis conducts an annual mapping for the source of essential materials for electric vehicle battery manufacturing.  \n\u2022 The reports of audit conducted by RCS describe non-compliance with human rights and grades them according to four classifications: critical, core, minor and observations only, each requiring corrective action plans.  \n\u2022 After the audit of suppliers, the corrective action plans are monitored to ensure that the identified concerns are resolved. Additional follow-up visits may be required to confirm evidence onsite.  \n\u2022 In 2021 Critical Supplier Audits, 47 observations and non compliances related to human rights\\(^1\\) out of which 0 critical non compliances.  \n\u2022 Supplier briefings are held each month to provide suppliers with human rights updates, communicate the Company\u2019s human rights expectations and inform them of legal and regulatory developments in human rights matters. Risk prevention on human rights takes place in the day-to-day relationship between buyers and suppliers.  \n\u2022 Stellantis has been a supporter of the 2021 release of the Global Workplace Standard for Mica Processors, used predominantly in surface coatings. This Standard addressed social obligations covering a range of labor practices such as age of employment, fair working hours, minimum wages and overtime, grievance mechanisms, freedom of association and diversity provisions, including women\u2019s rights and under-represented communities.  \n\u2022 To require, monitor and control the total respect for Human Rights along the entire global supply chain process, Stellantis commitment and results are:  \n\u2022 Targets on average Human Rights scores of Stellantis Tier-1 suppliers are:  \n  \u25aa In 2025: increase of +2.5% vs score as of 01/01/21; in 2030: Increase of +5% vs score as of 01/01/21; in 2050: in top level performance category.  \n  \u25aa In 2021, the increase in performance is of 2.7%.  \n\u2022 Stellantis is a member of Drive Sustainability. This association provides greater engagement with other OEMs, as well as access to additional tools and resources. In 2021 we worked to revise the Guiding Principles which outline expectations for suppliers on key responsibility issues including human rights and working conditions.  \n\u2022 Training for buyers and suppliers on human rights.  \n\u2022 The supplier training curriculum covers sustainability-related topics such as responsible working conditions and conflict minerals.  \n\u2022 Stellantis pays particular attention to supplier training and provides them with tools that enable them to rapidly identify and react to risk situations. Suppliers have access to e-learning on human rights principles to evaluate and improve their performance and how to build robust internal processes supporting human rights.  \n\u2022 In 2021, buyer training included two training events covering human rights topics. |\n\n\\(^1\\) Uphold freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor; Zero-tolerance of child labor; Elimination of discrimination in terms of employment and occupation; Anti-corruption measures and the prevention of conflicts of interest; Labor organization and disciplinary practice\n| Measures                                                                 | Process, main actions and results                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 4: A mechanism for alerting and for gathering reports on the existence or materialisation of risks | \u2022 Stellantis receives input from NGOs and actively collaborates with them on a partnership level.

The Stellantis conflict mineral supplier submission status is tracked and communicated by the purchasing organization to ensure that any needed escalation efforts are deployed quickly. The purchasing commodity directors are involved in escalation activities with the supply base, as needed, to reinforce the importance of providing due diligence evidence to support Stellantis\u2019 legal requirements.  \n\u2022 The Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT) that is provided by the RMI is requested from the in-scope suppliers using the 3TG metals (tungsten, tantalum, tin and gold). If there are concerns regarding the sourcing of raw materials, the suppliers must address the concerns and potentially set up alternative sources. The Company thus seeks to exercise its duty of care and foster sustainable procurement.  \n\u2022 92% in-scope suppliers for parts containing tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold have submitted the required CMRT  \n\u2022 The conflict minerals program management team is responsible for generating the annual in-scope supplier list that identifies which suppliers are required to provide the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT).  \n\u2022 The list of parts for products containing tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold is provided from regional technical contacts upon request.  \n\u2022 Once the Conflict Minerals data collection process begins, the designated members are required to track supplier submissions and provide updates so that progress reports can be presented to the purchasing management team. If a supplier is unresponsive, they will be placed into the escalation process which includes notifying the buyer and their management as appropriate. |\n8.3.2.

Risk areas include physical, ergonomic, chemical and psychosocial risks. The Hierarchy of Controls methodology is then used to determine the proper countermeasures.  \n\u2022 We attend to employee safety and well-being by applying a methodical approach that involves stakeholders, employees, employee representatives, the medical community and management. |\n| 2: Procedures for regular assessment of the situation in connection with risk mapping | \u2022 Our Well-being Health and Safety (WHS) management system, known as the Global Care Management System (GCMS), is compliant with the occupational health and safety recommendations of the International Labor organization (ILO-OSH 2001) and performs its obligations in all countries. Encompassing ISO 45001 requirements, the GCMS is a means to assess, monitor, and manage risks systematically.  \n\u2022 A team of 468 physicians and 527 nurses focus on prevention, occupational follow-up, emergency care and health promotion. Local workers at all Stellantis sites have access to medical resources. Prevention covers the activities dedicated to occupational risks and exposure assessment related to any health consequence from work activities. Occupational follow up includes monitoring, examinations to check for exposure consequence, assess fitness to work and any potential limitations. It includes individual follow up by physicians, trained nurses, physiotherapist, and/or psychologist to take into account early symptoms.  \n\u2022 Ergonomic evaluation and rating tools for our repetitive workstations is required in Stellantis plants, to measure the risk level for each workstation and to detect factors with the greatest risk of causing musculoskeletal disorders.  \n\u2022 At the heart of the COVID-19 crisis, at the beginning of 2021, Stellantis Health services implemented a survey on mental health, stress, well-being and motivation in 19 countries in Europe. Action plans are implemented under the responsibility of the country management.  \n\u2022 In the COVID-19 crisis, audit has been implemented at many stages, from the readiness of the facilities to safely welcome employees to the sustained implementation of prevention measures. The COVID-19 audit program provided the impetus to fix issues discovered related to the prevention protocol implementation. Employee representatives were involved in this process. In 2021, a total of 553 COVID-19 related audits have been implemented worldwide. |\n### Measures\n\n| Process, main actions and results |\n|----------------------------------|\n| **3: Appropriate actions to mitigate the risk of or to prevent serious breaches (and remediation plan when relevant)** |\n| \u2022 The Company allocates resources (e.g. standards, safe equipment and workstations, people, employee assistance programs) for an overall health approach |\n| \u2022 Stellantis is committed to implement the best occupational health and safety standards and practices. This commitment is demonstrated in the Well-being, Health and Safety policy, as well as in several national Company agreements with employees\u2019 representatives. 30 health and safety agreements were signed in 2021. |\n| \u2022 There are mandatory training and certification requirements targeted to operations and facilities. We provide health and safety protocols and recommendations regardless of where the workplace is located, on-site, home or remote working locations. Based on accident analysis and risk assessment, specific training programs are developed and deployed at all sites. In 2021, 363,410 hours of training were dedicated to safety and, in addition, 259,517 hours of training in the COVID-19 health protocol were delivered before returning to work. |\n\n**Health**\n\n\u2022 To handle COVID-19 crisis, we built common health protocols and unique protection measures. Acceptance of the COVID-19 protocols by our employees has been a key lever of the prevention measures effectiveness. Changes to measures were explained through discussions with managers, unions, health and safety professionals. Stellantis supported local vaccination policy and enabled employees to be vaccinated, through government vaccination programs, or, when possible, through internal vaccination centers. More than 24,728 employees were vaccinated internally.\n\n\u2022 Daily activities progressively took their place again in the schedule of the health teams, such as MSD (musculoskeletal disorders) prevention.\n\n\u2022 The Company has developed a program to prevent psychosocial risks which it is systematically deploying, including in the regions where societal concerns are yet to be raised in this field. Health teams were committed to promote and support these programs, especially for those who had to work remotely on a permanent and mandatory basis.\n\n\u2022 Chemical risk management involved a network of specialists and stakeholders to take prevention measures and reduce the risks to the lowest level, including a structured substitution policy.\n\n\u2022 80 Stellantis ergonomists works to design a user interface adapted to physical capabilities, to prevent the deterioration of working conditions and its consequences on individuals, e.g. health, particularly musculoskeletal diseases.\n\n**Safety**\n\n\u2022 A program of serious injury and fatality elimination is strategically overseen at a global level and promoted by the development of common global standards for high-risk activities and the implementation of Global \u201cCall-to-Actions\u201d, charging all sites with the implementation of common action plans to eliminate and control such high-risk hazards.\n\n\u2022 We target to achieve every year a Lost-time injury frequency rate <1. In 2021, we reach 1.\n\n**Well-being**\n\n\u2022 Remote working is encouraged where applicable to improve quality of life and work-life balance. The New Era of Agility (NEA) program allows employees in 23 countries to remote work up to 70%. The NEA provides guidelines to be respected that put a framework in place to define the differences between work and personal time.\n\n| 4: A mechanism for alerting and for gathering reports on the existence or materialisation of risks |\n|----------------------------------|\n| \u2022 All employee representatives can exercise vigilance and can report non-compliance, and their opinion is regularly solicited on the application of the agreement\u2019s commitments. |\n| \u2022 Each month, representatives from about 30 countries participate to a poll and share about working rhythm and atmosphere, manufacturing and sales activities, Unions activities and local policies. |\n| \u2022 In addition of the elements mentioned just before, refer to the paragraph \u201cReporting concerns - Integrity Helpline\u201d within section 8.3.4. |\n### Measures\n\n| Process, main actions and results |\n|----------------------------------|\n| 5: A system for monitoring measures implemented and for assessing their effectiveness |\n| \u2022 The governance process is overseen by the Strategy Council. In monthly Business Reviews at the Strategy Council level the results related to Health and Safety are presented and discussed with the analysis of the impact on operations. Stellantis targets to create a Well-being and Health committee, with EVP sponsors, to share at the Top Management level the stakes and results, to define the priorities and follow-up the actions. The Corporate Well-being Health and Safety (WHS) organization ensures proper coordination of WHS activities, processes and targets throughout the regional Stellantis Organizations. In each region a Well-being, Health and Safety leader is appointed and is in charge of contributing to the global policy, implementing the actions, supporting the operations in the region and providing the regional top management with results and analysis. |\n| \u2022 Because the Health and Safety domain is part of the Stellantis Production Way management system, key indicators of the manufacturing operations include the Health and Safety related indicators, among which Total Recordable Injury Rate, Lost Time Injury Rate and absenteeism rate. The proactive approach to Health and Safety will be tracked via the \u201cCare Index\u201d measuring the level of maturity of Health and Safety System Implementation in our sites. |\n| \u2022 In most host countries, joint management-worker organizations are in charge of monitoring the application of employee health and safety practices. 95% of Company employees are represented by 306 joint management-worker health and safety committees. |\n| \u2022 To handle COVID-19 crisis, weekly COVID-19 Committees bring together Stellantis physicians and nurses and Corporate and regional health leaders to monitor the situation and take common decisions. At the operations level, daily crisis cell meetings addressed concerns and issues. Concerns were processed by specific and multidisciplinary working groups that were referred to the COVID-19 committee, allowing reactivity, global vision and efficacy in the decision process. |\n\n### CSR ISSUE #2: Industrial and sites carbon footprint\n\n| Process, main actions and results |\n|----------------------------------|\n| 1: Risk mapping designed to identify, analyse and classify risks |\n| \u2022 As part of its Risk Management System, Stellantis uses its company-wide risk analysis framework to assess, manage and report climate-related physical and transition risks and opportunities. Global carbon footprint\u2019 is considered as top risks and presented to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. |\n| \u2022 Main emissions factors are |\n| \u2022 Energy consumption in the manufacturing plants of which foundries and paint shops are main contributors, |\n| \u2022 The electricity source type consumed by the manufacturing plants. |\n| \u2022 This involves an energy management approach that notably maps the energy performance of all manufacturing plants and identifies the areas in need of improvement. |\n| \u2022 Stellantis has completed a thorough review of its energy consumption and energy efficiency across the Company. A consumption control plan was developed to map the performance of the largest plants in order to identify the lines of action necessary for a full overhaul of their energy patterns. |\n### Measures\n\n#### 2: Procedures for regular assessment of the situation in connection with risk mapping\n\n- Company activity emissions (direct and indirect emissions) are derived from a GHG (greenhouse gas) assessments carried out at Stellantis plants, tertiary sites and Company-owned dealership network.\n- They are associated with fuel and electricity consumption in manufacturing plants (assembly plants or components factories) for 1.15%, tertiary sites (0.04%) and dealership networks (0.03%).\n- Completing an inventory of emitting sources is a key step on the roadmap to achieve carbon Net Zero.\n- In South America, Stellantis aims to measure, manage, reduce and offset the annual GHG emissions produced from the daily activities of regional plants through third-party verified emission inventory.\n  - The Stellantis assembly plant in Goiana (Brazil) was South America\u2019s first auto plant to have neutralized its scopes 1 and 2 from their GHG emission inventory certified by a third party. The result achieved in Goiana was extended to the 16 suppliers in its Supplier park.\n- Stellantis has completed a thorough review of its energy consumption and energy efficiency across the Company. A consumption control plan was developed to map the performance of the largest plants in order to identify the lines of action necessary for a full overhaul of their energy patterns.\n\n#### 3: Appropriate actions to mitigate the risk of or to prevent serious breaches (and remediation plan when relevant)\n\n- Major strategic projects with significant impact on the CO\u2082 emissions of the Company are being brought to the Board of Directors for review and decisions. The Board reviews the related financial implications, such as the CAPEX or strategic transformation needed to implement these projects. The Board discusses these projects for approval after being informed about aspects such as CO\u2082 emission consequences.\n- All plants have CO\u2082 reduction targets and are required to present roadmaps to reach net zero emissions and present yearly progress. The decision-making process which allows capital investments in carbon reduction projects takes carbon price into account as well as the alignment with the decarbonization goals.\n  - More than \u20ac6.3 million is invested in energy savings equals around \u20ac1.1 per vehicle produced.\n  - In 2021, the plants implemented energy saving activities, based on the best practices shared between the two former Companies. Each energy reduction project is validated based on its CO\u2082 impact and return on investment. Once validated and implemented at one of the Company\u2019s sites, initiatives that prove successful are gradually rolled out to all plants.\n- Stellantis has defined its CO\u2082 emission reduction roadmap and targets for scopes 1 and 2 in accordance with Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) methodology and aligned with 1.5\u00b0C scenario.\n  - Having 2021 as a baseline, the target is to reduce emissions from Scope 1 and 2 by 50% in 2025, by 75% in 2030 and reaching Carbon Net Zero, with single digit % compensation of residual emissions, by 2038.\n  - Results in 2021 are as follows:\n    - Breakdown of energy consumption from operations shows a share of decarbonized electricity of 45%.\n    - The initiatives implemented by Stellantis in 2021 resulted in an emission reduction in scope 1 and scope 2 of 49,924 tons of CO\u2082-eq equals to 8.8 kg of CO\u2082-eq/vehicle produced.\n- Stellantis is participating to the CO\u2082 emission allowance scheme.\n  - European regulation system: Stellantis is part of the CO\u2082 allowance trading plan implemented by European Directive No. 2003/87/EC, also called the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS)\n  - Canadian regulations system, Federal Output Based Pricing System (OBPS): a carbon levy program that imposes \u201ccarbon\u201d costs on all fossil fuel-based energy consumption across Canada.\n\n---\n\n1 Company activities \u2013 Scope 1 and 2 (Direct and indirect emissions) building performance with: fuel and electricity consumption in plants = 0.99%, tertiary sites = 0.03%, dealership networks = 0.02%\n### Measures\n\n| Process, main actions and results |\n|----------------------------------|\n| **4: A mechanism for alerting and for gathering reports on the existence or materialisation of risks** |\n| Refer to the paragraph \u201cReporting concerns - Integrity Helpline\u201d within section 8.3.4. |\n\n| **5: A system for monitoring measures implemented and for assessing their effectiveness** |\n| Reflecting Stellantis\u2019 commitment to embed CO\u2082 issues within executive decision-making, the Manufacturing CO\u2082 Steering Committee has been established in 2021. It provides Executive bodies with a global overview of CO\u2082 issues within industrial activities. This instance validates the mid- and long-term vision about CO\u2082 emissions from industrial activities. This committee reviews all initiative related to the plants to ensure that they are following the decarbonization strategy. |\n| The Industrial manufacturing divisions implement Stellantis Environmental and Energy policy to contribute to a decarbonized economy by achieving net zero emissions within its activities worldwide (scopes 1 and 2) by 2038 |\n| Stellantis is defining its joint Energy Management System. This managerial approach begins with an initial stage of staff involvement at all levels including the machine operator level, targeting the reduction of energy losses during non-production periods. The following stage consists of developing solutions to reduce consumption during production periods. As solutions are developed, best practices are shared and rolled out across the plants. |\n| At the end of 2021, majority of the Stellantis plants were ISO 50001 certified, representing approximately 77% of the Company\u2019s total energy consumption. |\n| Accredited third parties certify the Company\u2019s Energy Management System. Energy management team: facilities have dedicated Site utility manager and a team in charge of the energy management system. They monitor energy consumption, conduct audits, identify potential savings and, drive energy reduction projects. |\n| More than \u20ac6.3 million is invested in energy savings equals around \u20ac1.1 per vehicle produced. |\n| Real Estate committees integrate the environmental issues of projects into decision-making processes including improvement of energy efficiency in the major renovation projects of our dealership, financial support for energy retrofits of buildings, and the implementation of renewable energy solution. |\n| In 2021, the Real Estate Division continued to work on our footprint optimization for all Stellantis activities. |\n\n### CSR ISSUE #17: Control of industrial discharges and nuisances\n\n| Process, main actions and results |\n|----------------------------------|\n| **1: Risk mapping designed to identify, analyse and classify risks** |\n| Stellantis understands that the automotive production processes use substances and processes that generate air emissions that could potentially affect air quality, natural environments and the quality of life in the surrounding neighborhoods of our plants. Nuisances could also occur in the form of accidental releases of chemicals with potential impact on other environmental media such as soil or water, or on human health. |\n| Some VOCs (Volatile Organic Compound) are harmful to human beings and the environment. |\n| Sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082) and Nitrogen oxides (NOx) can form acid rain, which negatively affects ecosystems such as forests and lakes. |\n| Particulate Matter (PM) is solid or liquid particles that is measured in micrometers (1,000 times smaller than millimeter) and suspended into the air. PM can cause harm to human health, and the suspended particles can affect the amount of incoming and reflected radiation in the earth\u2019s atmosphere and therefore influence our climate. |\n| Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) are a group of chemical substances that can react with ozone and negatively impact the ozone layer of the stratosphere. The ozone layer prevents harmful wavelengths of ultraviolet light to reach the earth\u2019s surface which cause harm to human beings, vegetation and animals. |\n### Measures\n\n| Process, main actions and results |\n|----------------------------------|\n| **2: Procedures for regular assessment of the situation in connection with risk mapping** |\n| \u2022 We monitor and control air emissions such as Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), that are derived from solvent use in paint processes, Sulfur Dioxide (SO\u2082), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Particulate Matter (PM), that are the result of combustion processes (for example, burning fossil fuels for energy generation or heating purposes) and Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) that leaked from refrigeration and air conditioning equipment in our plants and offices. |\n| \u2022 When a new chemical product is introduced at a plant, its assessment includes checking the nature and acceptability of the health and environmental impacts. This assessment either results in a ban of the product or acceptance for use with risk prevention requirements. |\n| \u2022 Given the long history of some industrial facilities, soil impacts may be present at our sites. Historic contamination may be caused by leakages from underground storage tanks, underground pipes or spills. We conduct site investigations as part of ongoing initiatives, site acquisition or divestment projects, and at the request of regulators. The initial site investigation step usually includes record reviews and interviews to identify potential areas of concern. In the following steps, onsite investigations may include the analysis of soil, surface water or groundwater, or soil gas samples in order to determine the presence and extent of potential contamination. In some cases, this onsite investigation may consist of several phases to delineate the extent of the contamination. |\n| **3: Appropriate actions to mitigate the risk of or to prevent serious breaches (and remediation plan when relevant)** |\n| \u2022 In 2021, we started developing a corporate Environmental and Energy Policy. Environmental protection and energy performance are important Company objectives therefore input to the policy is required from many divisions. This process is ongoing and is projected to be completed by mid-2022. We identify the role of the environmental specialist as a key function that requires specific competence and training. We are updating standard job descriptions for our environmental experts that outline the technical and social skills required. We are reviewing training programs for all job levels. |\n| \u2022 Stellantis strives for zero VOC emissions. We monitor the following strategic KPI: Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions from paint shops normalized (g/m\u00b2 painted). |\n| \u2022 We target 25 g/m\u00b2 painted in 2025 and have the ambition of 0 g/m\u00b2 painted in 2050. In 2021 we emitted 24.95 g/m\u00b2 painted. |\n| \u2022 For reducing Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions, we focus our actions on reducing consumption of paints and their solvent content, implementing low-emission technologies and installing air treatment equipment for incinerating VOC. Measures for recycling and reuse of solvents for cleaning purposes are ongoing. Stellantis invests in research and development for new paints and paint technologies. Progress has been made to increase the solid content of the white paint on commercial vehicles, which allows the reduction of the amount of solvent and decreases VOC emissions. Stellantis is dependent on future technologies to accomplish the aspirational goal of zero VOC emissions in painting processes. |\n| \u2022 We work with suppliers to develop and test new painting methods and equipment, such as low overspray technology. |\n| \u2022 We reduce emissions of Sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082), Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and Particulate Matter (PM) through efficiency and modernization of equipment. In 2021, our SO\u2082 emissions were in total at 110 tons, NOx emissions were at 1,463 tons and PM at 115 tons. |\n| \u2022 Stellantis monitors ODS emissions during ODS-containing equipment maintenance or service activities and leak checks. ODS emissions are recorded in the event of an incident of an equipment installation. In 2021, our ODS emissions were in total at 39 kg of CFC-11 equivalent. |\n| \u2022 To limit the chemical risks, structural measures such as building retention basins or using above ground pipe systems versus underground piping to carry liquids, can limit the impact in case of accidental releases. To minimize chemical risks, supervisors or other functions conduct checks of environmental procedures and installations during site walks and inspections as part of Stellantis Production System or during ISO 14001 audits. In addition, inventories of chemical products in stock enables the facility to limit on-site volumes. Safety data sheets are developed for authorized products and access to the information is provided to employees. |\n| \u2022 For remediating soil contamination, measures such as monitoring, and containment are implemented. Our environmental experts liaise closely with the involved authorities to comply with local regulations. |\n| Measures                                                                 | Process, main actions and results                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 4: A mechanism for alerting and for gathering reports on the existence or materialisation of risks | Refer to the paragraph \u201cReporting concerns - Integrity Helpline\u201d within section 8.3.4.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| 5: A system for monitoring measures implemented and for assessing their effectiveness | \u2022 The EVP Manufacturing validates the CSR vision, ambitions and targets for the issues related to industrial discharges and nuisances and is responsible for their achievement. Performance is reviewed on a regularly basis and appropriate actions decided with regional leadership. The EVP of the Regions together with the Manufacturing officers are responsible to develop their plans and implement actions to meet the targets. On an annual basis, the Plant Managers are preparing site-specific plans including targets, actions and necessary investments to meet our environmental commitments. They are responsible for the environmental performance of their plant.  \n  \u2022 In our manufacturing facilities, we have dedicated environmental specialists supported by a network of nominated environmental representatives from various business functions. They are responsible to help ensure compliance with applicable regulation, for implementing the environmental policy and this includes managing the Environmental Management System (EMS) in compliance with ISO 14001 standard. An Environmental Management System is in place at 93% of our production facilities.  \n  \u2022 The Environmental Central Department (ECD) helps facilities with legal compliance and supports the local EMS by developing efficiencies and common standards. The ECD oversees and manages the quality of the EMS through audits and status reviews. ECD conduct strategic cross Functional planning for reducing the environmental impact. ECD evaluates and shares best practices with the plants to encourage continuous improvement.  \n  \u2022 Environmental performance is fully integrated into the Lean Manufacturing System of Stellantis and tracked with the main Manufacturing KPIs by a standardized score card process. Monthly leadership performance status reviews on a local and corporate level helps effectiveness of implemented measures and improves the environmental footprint according to the strategic plan. |\n8.3.3. THE USE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MARKETED BY THE COMPANY\n\nDuring 2021, Stellantis totaled 6.5 million combined sales, with more than 10 new models launched while accelerating the low emission vehicles (LEV) commercial momentum. Global LEV sales reached 388,000 units.\n\nCSR ISSUE #1: Vehicle CO\u2082 emissions\n\n| Measures | Process, main actions and results |\n|----------|----------------------------------|\n| 1: Risk mapping designed to identify, analyse and classify risks | \u2022 As part of its Risk Management System, Stellantis uses its company-wide risk analysis framework to assess, manage and report climate-related physical and transition risks.  \n\u2022 The two climate-related risks, \u2018natural hazards\u2019 and \u2018global carbon footprint\u2019, are considered as top risks and presented to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. |\n| 2: Procedures for regular assessment of the situation in connection with risk mapping | \u2022 The assessment of transition climate-related risks is based on a qualitative and quantitative climate-related scenario analysis. The scenarios used by Stellantis notably include potential scenarios for technological development or market conditions. Marketing and products division teams use various climate-related scenarios based on internal assessment, that are benchmarked with business partners and external scenarios developed by climate specialists, to ensure consistency with 1.5\u00b0C scenario.  \n\u2022 The output of those scenarios is the potential market evolution by energy and technologies in coming years and for different geographical zones, considering electricity mix projections in the countries considered. This analysis enables Stellantis to understand the minimum and maximum thresholds of electrified vehicles needed on the market to be aligned with Climate Paris Agreement. The use of climate-related scenarios also helps identifying the share of effort to be made to optimize CO\u2082 emissions on conventional thermal vehicles to reach Stellantis target relating to the average CO\u2082 emissions of all vehicles. |\n| Measures | Process, main actions and results |\n|----------|----------------------------------|\n| 3: Appropriate actions to mitigate the risk of or to prevent serious breaches (and remediation plan when relevant) | \u2022 Major strategic projects with significant impact on the CO\u2082 emissions of the products are being brought to the Board of Directors for review and decisions. The Board reviews the related financial implications, such as the CAPEX or strategic transformation needed to implement these projects. The Board discusses these projects for approval after being informed about aspects such as CO\u2082 emission consequences and expected changes in the future mobility market.  \n  \u2022 In 2021, the Company announced its plan to invest more than \u20ac30 billion through 2025 in electrification and software.  \n  \u2022 The Executive Vice President, Planning, holds direct and specific responsibility on corporate CO\u2082 emission average, and provides orientation for the development of new vehicles and in particular low-carbon vehicles.  \n  \u2022 CO\u2082 dedicated targets are annually set at various management levels and according to job perimeters. Corresponding incentive plan are in place to foster the climate performance of the Company and the achievement of the set targets.  \n  \u2022 Stellantis uses an internal carbon price to measure the cost efficiency of technical levers that reduce vehicle CO\u2082 emissions. This allows Stellantis to propose an optimized set of CO\u2082 reduction levers on its vehicles based on a cost-efficiency analysis.  \n  \u2022 The main levers for the Company to reduce vehicle CO\u2082 emissions are:  \n    \u2022 An increasingly low carbon offer (BEV and PHEV) relying on an ambitious electrification roadmap, to consolidate Stellantis position in the low-emission vehicle (LEV) segment in its various markets. Placing short-, medium- and long-term quantitative targets on the share of LEVs sales in the total sales mix and on the percentage of nameplates available in a LEV version enables Stellantis to define and track alignment with a clear roadmap of how to attain its fleet CO\u2082 emissions reduction targets.  \n      \u25a1 In 2021, the Company announced its ambition to make the LEV sales mix reach 100% in Europe and 50% in the U.S. in 2030. In 2021, LEV sales represented 12.8% of passenger cars in Europe and 3.4% of passenger cars and light duty trucks in the US.  \n      \u25a1 In 2021, 10 additional LEV models were launched.  \n    \u2022 A zero-emission fuel cell offer for LCVs, complementary to full battery models, in order to meet customers\u2019 expectations.  \n      \u25a1 In 2021, 3 FCEV (Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle) models were launched.  \n    \u2022 A BEV-dedicated platform strategy to be operational from 2023 to Speeding-up the electrification of the car line in all segments.  \n    \u2022 A vertical integration strategy aiming to control the LEV value chain and its costs, to secure supply and quality.  \n    \u2022 The deployment of MHEV (Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicle) technologies.  \n    \u2022 The deployment of technical levers to improve all key aspects of energy consumption: for example, weight, aerodynamics, rolling resistance and electrical consumption.  \n    \u2022 The deployment of a fast-charging network across Europe, to encourage EV adoption by supporting the EV ecosystem. |\n| 4: A mechanism for alerting and for gathering reports on the existence or materialisation of risks | Refer to the paragraph \u201cReporting concerns - Integrity Helpline\u201d within section 8.3.4 |\n### CSR ISSUE #10: Vehicle safety\n\n| Measures | Process, main actions and results |\n|----------|-----------------------------------|\n| 1: Risk mapping designed to identify, analyse and classify risks | \u2022 Stellantis understands that safety is one of the most important expectations in society and impacts customer choices. We integrate such expectations in each phase of the design of our vehicles. |\n| 2: Procedures for regular assessment of the situation in connection with risk mapping | \u2022 For every Stellantis vehicle project, safety experts perform technical assessments throughout the project and those results are summarized and communicated to the Product Development Department\u2019s top management for review and approval to continue.  \n\u2022 Stellantis has a dedicated team to investigate field issues including those with potential safety consequences. Investigations are launched to determine root causes, potential consequences and corresponding safety risks and countermeasures e.g., field actions and product safety recalls. The investigation team coordinates the response to the identified incidents with the engineering teams, manufacturing, suppliers and customer care. The procedures include opportunities for early detection, crisis management and immediate action. The safety expert network can contribute to this process for the root cause analysis and risk assessment.  \n\u2022 All Stellantis vehicles are rigorously tested and validated internally before being tested by outside stakeholders such as the U.S. government (NHTSA) or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) or NCAP organizations. In 2021, Stellantis performed more than 400,000 validations, either by physical or virtual validation. |\n### Measures\n\n| Process, main actions and results |\n|----------------------------------|\n| **3: Appropriate actions to mitigate the risk of or to prevent serious breaches (and remediation plan when relevant)** |\n| \u2022 Delivering safe products to our customers is among the essential responsibilities described in our Code of Conduct. We work to achieve compliance with regulatory standards to deliver quality products and services with a high level of safety and reliability. |\n| \u2022 Regarding the level of robustness of the global harmonized vehicle safety organization, processes and technical expertise, Stellantis has set the following targets: |\n|   \u2022 2025: Governance, organization and processes defined and set up, external audit every 3 years, performed by an independent assessment body and considering industry standards including ISO26262, ISO21448, ISO21434. |\n|   \u2022 2030: External audit performed each year, considering new technologies embedded in Stellantis products |\n| \u2022 Product safety-based training materials are captured in two courses: Introduction to U.S. Motor Vehicle Safety and Safety Defect Determination. Due to legislative and regulatory changes the U.S. Motor Vehicle Safety course has been delayed and will be launched for Stellantis employees in April 2022. These web-based courses are open as a reference to all former FCA global employees but they are a mandatory requirement for specific organizations in North America. |\n| \u2022 For the Safety Defect Determination course, 100% of the required employees completed the training in 2021. |\n| \u2022 Our suppliers in North America have access to a web-based training program that helps them understand expectations and supplier-specific requirements of the U.S. Motor Vehicle Safety Act and regulations of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). |\n| \u2022 Stellantis offers active (primary) and passive (secondary) features for diverse drivers and vehicle segments, along with tertiary safety elements. The intent of active safety systems is to help drivers avoid crashes by alerting them to certain potentially hazardous situations or assisting them in mitigating the risk posed by certain types of identified hazards. Passive, or secondary, safety systems are designed to help mitigate the effects of a crash. These include occupant restraint technology and the use of more advanced materials that enable us to improve crash energy management. In the area of tertiary safety, or post-accident emergency response, Stellantis provides emergency rescue sheets with information to rescue teams or first responders on special design elements and the position of components to be considered when assisting the occupants of vehicles involved in an accident. |\n| \u2022 Stellantis vehicles are equipped with new technology such as: |\n|   \u25a1 Speed limiting device, developed on 69% of Stellantis models in 2021 |\n|   \u25a1 Rear seats seatbelts with pretensioner and load limiter, developed on 66% of Stellantis models in 2021 |\n|   \u25a1 Automatic Emergency Braking, developed on 63% of Stellantis models in 2021 |\n|   \u25a1 Lane Keeping Assist, developed on 57% of Stellantis models in 2021 |\n| \u2022 Owners of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Fiat and Alfa Romeo vehicles will receive a free over-the-air software update called the Emergency Vehicle Alert System or EVAS, which was introduced at the 2022 CES electronics show in Las Vegas. Stellantis is the first automaker to implement its EVAS to 2018-and-newer Stellantis cars, trucks and SUVs. Initially available only in North America, it could be offered eventually in all 14 Stellantis brands worldwide. |\n| \u2022 The Stellantis advanced engineering organizations around the world apply virtual reality methods and innovative technological solutions for virtual and physical tests. The engineers also analyze real world data to develop and assess effective vehicle safety systems, protection for vulnerable road users and integration of active and passive safety systems. |\n| \u2022 Stellantis cybersecurity is underway in its preparation to receive certification of compliance for its Cyber Security Management Systems along with type approvals for vehicles sales and registrations as part of UNECE WP.29 R155 incorporated into GSR v2 2019/2144. |\n| \u2022 When potential vehicle safety issues arise, we promptly investigate and take corrective action as previously stated (refer to 4.3.6). This includes initiating safety recall campaigns when appropriate. Stellantis aims to improve the overall customer experience during the safety recall process through timely and accurate communication and reduced customer inconvenience. |\n### Measures\n\n| Process, main actions and results |\n|----------------------------------|\n| **4: A mechanism for alerting and for gathering reports on the existence or materialisation of risks** |\n| \u2022 Vehicle safety is included as part of our culture to increase vehicle quality by empowering employees, contractors, suppliers and dealers to speak up if they have concerns. |\n| \u2022 Employees are expected to comply with the implemented safety standards, taking appropriate steps to prevent, identify and correct any non-compliance with such standards. Any vehicle safety issue encountered must be immediately reported to supervisors, the Compliance or Legal Departments or through the whistleblower line. |\n| \u2022 In addition of the elements mentioned just before, also refer to the paragraph \u201cReporting concerns - Integrity Helpline\u201d within section 8.3.4. |\n| **5: A system for monitoring measures implemented and for assessing their effectiveness** |\n| \u2022 Stellantis created a unified Global Safety Forum led by the Global Technical Safety and Regulatory Compliance Manager. This forum will guide the Company on the application of future standards and ratify future processes and procedures concerning vehicle safety and security. We are growing our Transversal Safety Expertise Networks to further develop and improve our safety processes and assess their implementation in our vehicles. At a regional level, decision making processes are in place to address potential vehicle safety issues. |\n| \u2022 Stellantis monitors the implementation of each safety recall campaign specifically based on progress indicators and the actual repairs made in each campaign. Repeat requests are sent to customers who do not come forward. |\n| \u2022 In 2021, there were 124 recall campaigns involving 3,003,480 initial recall notices for 6,058,212 Stellantis vehicles worldwide. The operations carried out are free of charge for the customer. |\n\n### CSR ISSUE #14: Wise use of material\n\n| Process, main actions and results |\n|----------------------------------|\n| **1: Risk mapping designed to identify, analyse and classify risks** |\n| \u2022 The Global Purchasing and Supply Chain EVP and the Engineering EVP, both direct reports to the CEO, and members of the Top Executive Team and the Strategy Council are responsible for the materials strategy. Mapping of material risks for both current and forecasts, is performed according to specific criteria for each raw material, including: |\n| \u25a1 significant contribution to develop existing technologies. |\n| \u25a1 scarcity and geographic location. |\n| \u25a1 social and environmental impacts including recyclability and extraction or production conditions. |\n| \u25a1 geopolitical or logistic accessibility. |\n| \u2022 Based on this risk mapping, the EVPs validate the R&D roadmap on substitute materials or alternative supplies. |\n| \u2022 Examples of the last outputs of this material risks mapping: |\n| \u25aa Transition to electrified vehicles is generating need for new raw materials such as lithium, nickel and cobalt. |\n| \u25aa Demand for the materials needed for nanotechnologies is greater than ever in the context of the increased appetite for connected vehicles. |\n| \u25aa Metals used to support nanotechnologies experience market tensions and are increasingly harder to mine: the metal content of the ore is decreasing, while mines currently operated show lower concentrations which implies more and more processing. |\n| Measures | Process, main actions and results |\n|----------|----------------------------------|\n| 2: Procedures for regular assessment of the situation in connection with risk mapping | \u2022 Stellantis conducts Life Cycle Assessment (LCAs) in line with ISO standards 14040/44 to analyze the multi-criteria environmental footprint of a vehicle, its components and materials design. The entire product life cycle is considered from raw material extraction to manufacture, use and end-of-life. Critical reviews are conducted with external experts (the last one focused on battery electric vehicle DS3 Crossback e-tense).  \n\u2022 The results of life cycle assessments help to improve the vehicles\u2019 environmental record:  \n  \u25aa highlighting the environmental advantage of one innovative solution compared to another, and more broadly, the overall environmental impact of a product;  \n  \u25aa identifying possible pollution transfers from one phase of the life cycle to another;  \n  \u25aa highlighting core environmental impacts;  \n  \u25aa choosing more environmentally friendly technologies and materials.  \n\u2022 100% of new models undergo a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The impact of new electrified powertrain is also evaluated. In 2021, LCAs covered 62% of the total fleet sold. |\n| 3: Appropriate actions to mitigate the risk of or to prevent serious breaches (and remediation plan when relevant) | **Scarcity of materials**  \n\u2022 **Limit and reduce the use of critical materials**: for instance, Stellantis works to increase battery energy density which would decrease the quantity of raw materials needed per unit of energy.  \n\u2022 **Develop alternative materials to substitute critical materials**: for instance, Stellantis conducts research and development activities for solid-state batteries and chemical compositions for other raw materials that are not considered critical. From 2024, Stellantis plans to base its electrification strategy on two battery technologies, both without cobalt.  \n\u2022 **Use of Green Materials**: Stellantis is involved in the integration of recycled and natural materials in the Company\u2019s vehicles. Engineering resources are dedicated to increasing their rate in the production of vehicles. Stellantis has set the following targets: launch the first vehicles containing 25% of Green Materials in 2025 / launch the first vehicles containing 40% of Green Materials in 2030. In 2021, more than 15 vehicles embark green materials.  \n**Hazardous substances**  \n\u2022 **Eliminate four heavy metals**: lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium which are regulated by the European Directive No 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles and its exemptions list mentioned in Annex II;  \n\u2022 **Substitute some substances targeted by regulations such as REACH**: the Company has set up an organization and communication system to monitor its partners and suppliers using the REACH automotive industry guidelines.  \n\u2022 **Limit Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)**: Concerning vehicle interior air quality, Stellantis has voluntarily introduced technical solutions to support customer health, safety and comfort in the cabin. These include filters for air flow into the passenger compartment and limits on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the materials used.  \n**End-of-life processes**  \n\u2022 **Ensure that vehicles are highly recyclable**: All the Company\u2019s vehicles in Europe are 95% recoverable and 85% recyclable. In Regions outside Europe, the Company is actively analyzing the regional and local market situation as well as ELV-related legislation.  \n\u2022 **Extend the High Voltage Batteries (HVB) lifespan before recycling**: In 2021, 1,723 of the batteries used in Stellantis\u2019 vehicles had a life cycle management solution: 17 were repaired, 516 were remanufactured, 895 were used in 2nd life projects such as energy storage, and 295 were recycled. Stellantis set the following targets regarding the availability of solutions to optimize HVB lifespan: at least one solution is implemented for each HVB sold in EU, NA, China in 2025 / at least one solution is implemented for each High Voltage Battery in all countries where EVs are sold in 2030 / all solutions implemented in all countries where EVs are sold in 2050.  \n\u2022 **Offer customers the option of remanufactured and reused parts**, which allows cost savings for customers compared to equivalent original new parts while reducing the raw material usage.  \n\u2022 **Offer customers verified pre-owned vehicles**: more affordable than brand new models and helping to preserve natural resources needed to build a vehicle. |\n### CSR ISSUE #15: Vehicle impact on air quality\n\n| Measures | Process, main actions and results |\n|----------|-----------------------------------|\n| 1: Risk mapping designed to identify, analyse and classify risks | \u2022 Global emissions standards continue to become increasingly stringent. Stellantis is aware that there are risks associated with the changing requirements. Product environmental innovations are essential for the achievement of such standards. |\n| 2: Procedures for regular assessment of the situation in connection with risk mapping | \u2022 Employees involved in meeting compliance and regulations of emissions are expected to know and respect not only the requirements imposed by applicable laws and regulations, but also the applicable internal rules and processes we use to help achieve such compliance. To support this, employees have access to processes that use and make available information databases, technical and engineering guidelines, networks of meetings and governance, reference documents, and training materials. |\n### Measures\n\n| Process, main actions and results |\n|----------------------------------|\n| **3: Appropriate actions to mitigate the risk of or to prevent serious breaches (and remediation plan when relevant)** |\n| \u2022 Low Emission Vehicles (LEVs) generate significantly lower emissions compared to ICE vehicles. Stellantis targets that more than 70% of its vehicle sales in Europe and more than 40% of vehicle sales in the United States will be low emission vehicles (LEV) by 2030. |\n| \u2022 To achieve these targets, we increase our portfolio of electrified vehicles. For instance 10 battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are expected to be launched by 2022. |\n| \u2022 In parallel with its electrification strategy, Stellantis develops advanced emission control technologies to minimize environmental impact of internal combustion engines: |\n| \u2022 To minimize particulate matter emissions, both in particle numbers and mass, optimized engine measures and the use of wall flow particulate filters are effective technologies. Particulate filters allow the screening of both fine and ultra-fine particulate matter. Depending on the fuel the result can achieve up to 99.7% by number and up to more than 95% by mass. The particular filter is an effective mechanical system which is fully operational throughout the phases of engine operation and driving conditions. |\n| \u2022 We have developed and continue to improve the technology for a high performing filter for spark ignition engines to further reduce ultrafine particles from gasoline engines. The technology development will take into account the new constraints resulting from powertrain electrification. This new filter technology is expected to be launched in 2022. |\n| \u2022 Also, Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emissions are minimized adopting different technologies for ICE: Three Way Catalyst and Selective Catalyst Reduction are the main technologies for vehicle applications around the world. |\n| \u2022 Stellantis continuously makes R&D investments to the improvement of vehicle tailpipe emissions quality and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. These investments have led to worldwide development of technical solutions (electrification...) to improve reduction of fossil fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. |\n| \u2022 Share of ZEV\\(^1\\) in global sales mix in 2021 in EU: 8% of Passenger Cars.

CODE OF CONDUCT, INTEGRITY HELPLINE AND COMPLIANCE CONTROL: TRANSVERSAL MEANS TO REINFORCE OUR VIGILANCE\n\nThe means described below apply transversely to the 12 CSR issues included in this vigilance plan.\n\nCode of Conduct\n\nThe Stellantis Code of Conduct was approved by the Board of Directors of Stellantis N.V. in March 2021. It applies to the members of the Stellantis Board of Directors, Stellantis\u2019s officers, full-time and part-time employees, temporary and contract workers. Stellantis also expects its stakeholders, including suppliers, dealers, distributors, and joint venture partners, to act with integrity and in accordance with the Code. It is the responsibility of all workforce members to report suspected or potential violations of the Code of Conduct.\n\nThe Stellantis Code of Conduct focuses on four main areas:\n\n- the protection of the Stellantis workforce, including a commitment to diversity, fairness, and health and safety, and to the United Nations declaration on human rights and the International Labour Organization\u2019s declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work;\n- the way that Stellantis conducts business, engaging in sustainable practices that promote vehicle safety, quality, data privacy and environmental protection, and that comply with other applicable laws and regulations, such as anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, insider trading and others;\n- the interaction of Stellantis\u2019s workforce with external parties, including the avoidance of conflicts of interest and the support of our communities; and\n- the protection of Stellantis\u2019s assets and information.\n\nThe Stellantis Code of Conduct is available under the Governance section on the Company\u2019s website.\n\nTo reinforce ethics and compliance communications, the Ethics and Compliance Committee oversees a multi-year training plan. In 2021, the Company produced and released an online training on the Code of Conduct that was shared with the Stellantis Board members. The training is designed to be user-friendly and viewable on mobile devices. Close to the end of 2021, 77,285 people had individually completed the Code of Conduct online training and confirmed their acknowledgment of the Code of Conduct, comprising 88% of targeted employees.\n\nReporting Concerns - Integrity Helpline\n\nIn 2021, Stellantis merged the former PSA and FCA whistle-blower systems into one single, robust system. The new Stellantis whistle-blower channel is designed to ensure that any suspected violations of our Code of Conduct can be reported, received, and resolved properly and efficiently. Our \u201cAlways with Integrity\u201d campaign highlights the availability of the reporting system for all types of concerns, including vehicle safety and regulatory concerns. This system is open to workforce members, business partners and other stakeholders and is accessible on Stellantis\u2019s website, Governance section.\n\nThrough our internal controls and the use of specialized, independent service providers, the Company\u2019s whistleblower channel is designed to protect the confidentiality of persons who make a report. Reports may be made anonymously unless local law provides otherwise.\n\nReports are investigated as appropriate by trained investigators and subject matter experts, and are tracked until their completion. We apply corrective actions to confirmed violations of the Code.\n\nIn addition to the whistleblower channel, workforce members have the ability to raise questions about the Code or reports of potential violations to their direct supervisors and the Human Resources, Compliance, and Legal Departments.\n\nAt Stellantis, we do not allow any retaliation against any person who makes a report in good faith or who cooperates in an investigation. Interested parties are allowed to report a concern confidentially and anonymously where allowed by law. Any retaliation is subject to disciplinary action.\nControls\n\nThe Internal Audit and Compliance Department includes regulatory compliance and the ethics and compliance program within the scope of its annual audit plan. Pursuant to the department\u2019s procedures for the selections of topics for internal audits, the department may choose to review adherence to policies dealing with competition, anti-corruption, data privacy, export controls, and other compliance-related topics.\n\nAt appropriate times, the Company selects external parties to conduct audits of specific functions. External Audits performed by independent auditors include topics such as Integrity Helpline, emissions-related regulatory compliance, environmental health and safety, and energy management systems. The Integrity Helpline and compliance with emissions regulations as well as applicable agreements with certain governing agencies are audited by those governmental agencies, while environmental health and safety, and energy management systems are audited by an accredited ISO Certification body.\n\nThe Company also conducts a Compliance Assessment to ensure that the Ethics and Compliance Program identifies compliance risks, takes proper steps to mitigate such risks, and does so in an efficient manner. This process includes information from various internal sources, but also incorporates benchmarking from organizations devoted to corporate ethics, such as Ethisphere.\n8.4 AUDITOR\u2019S REPORT\n\nThe Company decided to obtain an independent auditor\u2019s opinion on the truthfulness of the consolidated social, societal and environmental information presented in the CSR Report. The firm Grant Thornton was appointed as independent auditor. The conclusions of this report are presented below.\n\nASSURANCE REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS\n\nTo the Shareholders,\n\nOur conclusions\n\nWe have examined a selection of KPIs included in the accompanying Corporate Social Responsibility report (hereafter: CSR report) for the year 2021 of Stellantis N.V based in Amsterdam. Our examination is aimed to obtain limited assurance for a selection of KPIs (hereafter: the limited assurance KPIs), and reasonable assurance for an additional selection of KPIs (hereafter: reasonable assurance KPIs) (see appendix).\n\nOur limited assurance conclusion\n\nBased on our review nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the limited assurance KPIs are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and applied supplemental reporting criteria as included in section \u20188. Appendix\u2019 of the CSR report.\n\nOur reasonable assurance opinion\n\nIn our opinion the reasonable assurance KPIs are prepared, in all materials aspects, in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and applied supplemental reporting criteria as included in section \u20188. Appendix\u2019 of the CSR report.\n\nOther information\n\nBased on our examination, we conclude that the other information included in the CSR Report is consistent with the selected KPIs.\n\nBasis for our conclusions\n\nWe performed our examination in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3000A \u2018Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information\u2019. Our responsibilities under this standard are further described in the section \u2018Our responsibilities for the examination of the limited assurance KPIs and reasonable assurance KPIs of our report.\n\nWe are independent of Stellantis N.V in accordance with the \u2018Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten\u2019 (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in The Netherlands. Furthermore we have complied with the \u2018Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants\u2019 (VGBA, Dutch code of ethics).\n\nWe believe that the assurance evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusions.\n\nReporting criteria\n\nThe selection of KPIs need to be interpreted and understood together with the reporting criteria. Stellantis N.V. is solely responsible for selecting and applying these reporting criteria, taking into account applicable law and regulations related to reporting.\n\nThe reporting criteria used for the preparation of the selected KPIs are the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the applied supplemental reporting criteria as disclosed in section \u20188.1 Reporting scope and methodology\u2019 of the CSR report.\n\nThe absence of an established practice on which to draw, to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time.\nMateriality\n\nBased on our professional judgement we determined materiality levels for the selected KPIs. When evaluating our materiality levels, we have taken into account quantitative and qualitative considerations as well as the relevance of information for both stakeholders and the company.\n\nLimitations to the scope of our examination\n\nIt is not our responsibility to comment on:\n- the entity\u2019s compliance with other applicable legal and regulatory requirements;\n- the compliance of products and services with the applicable regulations.\n\nScope of the group examination\n\nStellantis N.V is the parent company of a group of entities. The selected KPIs incorporate the consolidated information of this group of entities to the extent as specified in \u20188. Appendix\u2019 in the CSR report.\n\nOur examination consisted of both assurance procedures at corporate (consolidated) level and at site level. Our selection of sites in scope of our review procedures and our audit procedures are primarily based on the site\u2019s individual contribution to the consolidated information. Furthermore, our selection of sites considered relevant reporting risks and geographical spread.\n\nBy performing our review procedures and audit procedures at site level, together with additional review procedures and audit procedures at corporate level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate assurance evidence about the group\u2019s selected KPIs to provide a conclusion about the selected limited assurance KPIs and the selected reasonable assurance KPIs.\n\nResponsibilities of the management board for the selected KPIs\n\nThe management board is responsible for the preparation of reliable and adequate KPIs in accordance with the reporting criteria as included in the section \u2018reporting criteria\u2019, including the identification of stakeholders and the definition of material matters. The choices made by the management board regarding the scope of the KPIs and the reporting policy are summarised in section \u20188. Appendix\u2019 of the CSR report.\n\nFurthermore, the management board is responsible for such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the KPIs that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nOur responsibilities for the examination of the limited assurance KPIs and reasonable assurance KPIs\n\nOur responsibility is to plan and perform our examination in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate assurance evidence for our conclusions.\n\nOur examination performed to obtain limited assurance on the limited assurance KPIs differ in nature and timing and are less extent as compared to reasonable assurance engagements. The level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is therefore substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.\n\nOur examination to obtain reasonable assurance on the reasonable assurance KPIs has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not have detected all material errors and fraud.\n\nWe apply the \u2018Nadere voorschriften kwaliteitssystemen\u2019 (NVKS, Regulations for Quality management systems) and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and other relevant legal and regulatory requirements.\nOur examination included among others:\n\n- performing an analysis of the external environment and obtaining an understanding of relevant social themes and issues, and the characteristics of the Company;\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting criteria used, their consistent application and related disclosures in the selected KPIs;\n- obtaining an understanding of the reporting processes for the selected KPIs, including obtaining a general understanding of internal control relevant to our procedures;\n- identifying areas of the selected KPIs with a higher risk of misleading or unbalanced information or material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error;\n- designing and performing further assurance procedures aimed at determining the plausibility of the selected KPIs responsive to this risk analysis. These procedures consisted amongst others of:\n  - interviewing management and relevant staff at corporate and local level responsible for the sustainability strategy, policy and results;\n  - interviewing relevant staff responsible for providing the information for, carrying out internal control procedures on, and consolidating the data for the selected KPIs;\n  - determining the nature and extent of our procedures for the group components and locations. Based thereon we selected the components and locations to visit on site and virtually. The visits to the selected sites are aimed at, on a local level, validating source data and evaluating the design and implementation of internal controls and validation procedures.\n  - Obtaining assurance information that the selected KPIs reconcile with underlying records of the company;\n  - assessing relevant internal and external documentation;\n  - performing an analytical review of the data and trends in the information.\n- Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the selected KPIs;\n- considering whether the selected KPIs as a whole, including the disclosures, reflects the purpose of the reporting criteria used.\n\n25th March 2022\n\nGrant Thornton France\nVincent Frambourt\nPartner\n\nGrant Thornton Netherlands\nMax van Rijssel\nPartner of Grant Thornton Accountants en Adviseurs B.V.\n\n1Industrial plants audited: Sochaux, Betim Assembly Plant, Goiana Assembly Plant, Betim Engine & Transmission Plant, Caen, Charleville, Mulhouse, Eisenach, Ruesselsheim, Atessa Sevel Assembly Plant, Melfi Assembly Plant, Turin\n## APPENDIX\n\n| CSR issues                                      | List of selected KPIs Limited Assurance                                                                 | List of additional selected KPIs Reasonable Assurance                                                                 |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1.
