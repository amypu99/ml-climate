We are bringing renewable electricity to 3500 households in South Africa that previously lacked access to electricity.\nReflections\n\nIn a year where the technology we make touched more lives than ever, teams across Apple never stopped innovating to protect the planet. Whether it\u2019s using more recycled materials in our products, or transitioning our supply chain to 100 percent clean energy, there is no part of Apple this work does not reach.\n\nThis year\u2019s Environmental Progress Report shows the breadth of the environmental solutions we\u2019re advancing, and the scale of collaboration that helped make them possible. The details here matter, because they add up to meaningful, substantive progress in our work for the planet. We are laser-focused on our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality for our entire footprint by 2030, a goal we have already reached for our own operations. At the same time, we\u2019re working to one day make our products without taking from the earth, and to be a force for equity in the world around us.\n\nAcross all of these efforts, we never lose sight of our primary mission \u2014 working to address the climate crisis. It\u2019s an urgent challenge no one company, entity or individual can tackle alone, and this year, we\u2019re addressing it with more ambition than ever before. In fact, we\u2019ve begun to decouple business growth from emissions as we drive towards our goal of bringing our entire carbon footprint to net zero by 2030 \u2014 including our supply chain and the use of our products. While our revenue grew 33 percent, our net emissions remained flat.\n\nToday, 213 of our suppliers \u2014 representing the majority of Apple\u2019s direct supplier spend \u2014 are committed to using 100 percent renewable energy for their Apple business. In the last year, we more than doubled the amount of clean energy used to manufacture Apple products.\n\nWe\u2019re also making great strides toward our goal of one day making our products without mining. In fiscal year 2021, nearly 20 percent of the materials we shipped in Apple products came from recycled sources. We\u2019ve more than doubled our use of recycled tungsten, rare earth elements, and cobalt. And initiatives like our Apple Trade In program, and advancements in recycling technology, continue to reduce our impact on the planet by using yesterday\u2019s products to help build tomorrow\u2019s.\nWe also know that a greener future must be a more equitable one. It\u2019s why we continue to advance our Impact Accelerator, which invests in a diverse class of entrepreneurs developing next generation innovations in green technologies. That includes leaders like Karl Johnson, whose company develops environmentally-friendly adhesives that make it easier to repair and recycle new technologies, or Betty Manetta whose company has pioneered an AI-based, real-time data collection process to assess energy consumption for its users.\n\nEquity also drives the mission of our Power for Impact initiative, which we launched to help connect underserved communities with clean, renewable energy. In communities from South Africa to the Philippines, from Thailand to Israel, we\u2019ve helped bring solar and wind energy to schools, hospitals, and rural communities.\n\nAnd, working with Conservation International and Goldman Sachs, our Restore Fund invests to develop working forests \u2014 which support local economic opportunity while sequestering carbon from the atmosphere.\n\nAt Apple, we believe in making bold commitments to improve the world around us \u2014 and taking bold steps to meet them. We set measurable goals, and then we get to the hard work of getting them done. And along the way, we share updates with our customers, our partners, and the communities we touch.\n\nAs always, we\u2019re grateful for your interest in this work and to all our partners for joining Apple\u2019s journey. And we can\u2019t wait to share all of the innovations we have in store.\n\nLisa Jackson\nOur environmental strategy\n\nThe environmental challenges we face today are significant, and we are responding with urgency and dedication. We approach our work by focusing on fundamental questions. What matters most? And where can we make the greatest impact? These questions guide our work across our strategic pillars of climate change, resources, and smarter chemistry \u2014 and inform our goals in how we can best achieve change. We know we\u2019re not alone in working to reduce our environmental footprint. So we\u2019re engaging with others to support our efforts and find opportunities to lift local communities along the way.\n\n**Climate Change**\n\nWe\u2019re already carbon neutral for our corporate operations and we\u2019ve set a goal to become carbon neutral for our entire product footprint by 2030. We plan to get there by reducing our emissions by 75 percent compared with 2015, and then investing in carbon removal solutions for the remaining emissions.\n\n- Low-carbon design\n- Energy efficiency\n- Renewable electricity\n- Direct emissions abatement\n- Carbon removal\n\n**Resources**\n\nWe aim to make durable, long-lasting products and packaging using only recycled or renewable materials, and enhance material recovery. At the same time, we\u2019re committed to stewarding water resources and sending zero waste to landfill.\n\n- Materials\n- Water\n- Zero waste\n\n**Smarter Chemistry**\n\nThrough chemistry innovation and rigorous controls, we design our products to be safe for anyone who assembles, uses, or recycles them \u2014 and to be better for the environment.\n\n- Mapping and engagement\n- Assessment and management\n- Innovation\n\n**Engagement**\n\nBy engaging with others on our environmental work, we can achieve an even greater impact that considers communities around the world. We learn from feedback and we work with partners to influence change in our industries. And we are transparent about our challenges and achievements to inspire others to take their own action.\nWe create products and services to enrich the lives of our customers. And we strive to do so in a way that sustains the planet and the resources that we all depend on. Setting ambitious goals is essential to this \u2014 to drive the innovation and collaboration that makes change possible and to be transparent and accountable to our progress.\n\n**Goals**\n\n**Climate Change**\n- Achieve carbon neutrality for our entire carbon footprint by 2030, and reach our science-based emissions reduction target\n- Create products with net zero carbon impact by 2030\n- Transition our entire product supply chain to 100% renewable electricity by 2030\n\n**Resources**\n- Use only recycled and renewable materials in our products and packaging, and enhance material recovery\n- Eliminate plastics in our packaging by 2025\n- Reduce water impacts in the manufacturing of our products, use of our services, and operation of our facilities\n- Eliminate waste sent to landfill from our corporate facilities and our suppliers\n\n**Smarter Chemistry**\n- Drive comprehensive reporting of chemicals used in our supply chain to make our products\n- Integrate smarter chemistry innovation into the way we design and build our products\n- Avoid exposure to chemicals that could be harmful to human health or the environment\nReport highlights\n\nIn this past year, we\u2019ve continued to show considerable progress \u2014 a testament to the dedication, hard work, and innovative approaches to complex challenges of our employees, suppliers, industry partners, and stakeholders. Our objectives remain clear: to reduce our impact, create equitable solutions, and drive broader change within the industry and our communities. Our progress can be measured by our achievements across our business. And the challenges that remain galvanize our efforts and drive us forward.\n\nCarbon neutral for corporate emissions\n\nSince April 2020, we\u2019ve achieved carbon neutrality for our corporate emissions by sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity for Apple facilities, implementing energy efficiency initiatives, and securing carbon offsets for remaining emissions.\n\n213 suppliers committed to renewable electricity\n\nAs of March 2022, 213 suppliers have committed to renewable electricity for Apple production, representing the majority of Apple\u2019s direct supplier spend. In fiscal year 2021, Apple and its suppliers brought online over 10 gigawatts of renewable energy in our supply chain, doubling the amount from the prior year.\n\n40% overall emissions reductions\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, our environmental initiatives avoided over 23 million metric tons of emissions across all scopes, and we reduced our carbon footprint by 40 percent compared with fiscal year 2015. Efforts and initiatives that we\u2019ve been growing for years made this possible \u2014 like sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity for our facilities, transitioning suppliers to clean energy, and using low-carbon materials in products.\n\nSupported 10 renewable projects through Power for Impact\n\nWe funded 10 clean energy projects that support economic growth, social impact, and equity in under-resourced communities around the world, while advancing Apple\u2019s carbon neutrality goal.\nContinuing innovation on material recovery\n\nThis year we introduced our latest recycling machine, Taz, which is designed to recover modules containing rare earth magnets typically lost in conventional shredders, helping improve our overall material recovery rate. We\u2019ve also expanded Daisy\u2019s recycling capabilities from 15 to 23 models of iPhone and continue to develop Dave, our robot that disassembles Taptic Engines and helps recover valuable rare earth magnets, tungsten, and steel.\n\n--- Read more on page 50\n\nPartner of the Year award from the EPA\n\nFor the second year in a row, we received the EPA Safer Choice Partner of the Year Award, recognizing our work to scale the use of safer process chemicals and protect those working in our supply chain. In 2020, Apple was the first consumer electronics company to receive this award.\n\n--- Read more on page 71\n\n75% less plastic in packaging compared with 2015\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, plastics accounted for only 4 percent of our packaging \u2014 which marks significant progress toward our goal to eliminate plastics from our packaging entirely by 2025.\n\n--- Read more on page 42\n\nSuppliers eliminating landfill waste\n\nEstablished final assembly and sub-assembly sites for Apple Watch Series 7 do not send any waste to landfill. This builds on our progress of all final assembly sites making Apple products without sending waste to landfill.\n\n--- Read more on page 58\n\nMore products with more recycled content\n\nWe\u2019re making progress toward our goal of transitioning to 100 percent recycled and renewable materials in our products. In fiscal year 2021, we more than doubled our use of recycled tungsten, rare earth elements, and cobalt \u2014 and introduced certified recycled gold for the first time in an Apple product.\n\n--- Read more on page 34\n\nWelcomed the first class of the Impact Accelerator\n\nFifteen Black-, Hispanic/Latinx-, and Indigenous-owned businesses on the cutting edge of green technology and clean energy participated in Apple\u2019s inaugural Impact Accelerator, a unique program designed to expand opportunities within Apple\u2019s supply chain and beyond. The Accelerator aims to help combat systemic barriers to opportunity, while also advancing innovative solutions to environmental challenges like climate change.\n\n--- Read more on page 81\nClimate Change\n\nWe\u2019re committed to making all of our products carbon neutral by 2030.\nGoals and progress\n\nAt Apple, we\u2019re committed to doing our part to fight climate change. For us, this means taking bold action. Our goal to be carbon neutral by 2030 is both ambitious and necessary. The efforts that support this goal require innovations at scale \u2014 like designing and implementing new technologies, mobilizing innovative financing, and rapidly deploying renewable energy. This chapter looks at our latest progress. We are continuing to deploy solutions to address our remaining footprint with great urgency.\n\nAchieve **carbon neutrality** for our entire carbon footprint, including products, by 2030. And reduce related emissions by 75% compared with fiscal year 2015\n\n- 40% emissions reduction since 2015 across our value chain\n- Established the $200M Apple Restore Fund with the aim of removing over 1M metric tons of carbon per year\n- 23M metric tons of emissions avoided in fiscal year 2021 alone due to carbon reduction initiatives across our value chain\n\nBecome **carbon neutral** for corporate operations\n\n- Achieved since April 2020 by implementing energy efficiency initiatives, sourcing 100% renewable electricity for Apple facilities, and securing carbon offsets for the remaining corporate emissions\n\nTransition our entire manufacturing supply chain to **100% renewable electricity** by 2030\n\n- As of March 2022, 213 suppliers have committed to 100% renewable electricity for Apple production, representing the majority of Apple\u2019s direct worldwide spend for materials, manufacturing, and assembly of products\nOur approach\n\nWith each year, the impacts of climate change become more clear. From shifting weather patterns that threaten food production, to widespread wildfires that devastate entire communities and ecosystems, the dangers are global in scope and unprecedented in their pace of change. They pose a threat to fundamental human rights \u2014 life, health, food, and adequate standard of living \u2014 and are experienced disproportionately in low-income and historically marginalized communities. Global, comprehensive, and immediate action today can prevent even worse impacts of climate change.\n\nAs a global business, we believe it is our responsibility to take strong, decisive, and inclusive steps to mitigate our climate impact. We\u2019ve committed to achieving carbon neutrality \u2014 reducing emissions 75 percent compared with fiscal year 2015 and balancing the residual emissions with carbon removal \u2014 across the life cycle of our products by 2030. This goal is more aggressive than the recommendation for global carbon neutrality by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change by 20 years. It\u2019s an ambitious plan with plenty of challenges ahead. But we\u2019re already well on our way, having cut emissions across our value chain by 40 percent since fiscal year 2015.\n\nOur work began years ago, making the transition to sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity at our offices, retail stores, and data centers, which we achieved in 2018. And in 2020, we took steps to be carbon neutral for our corporate emissions, including business travel and employee commute.\n\nOur philosophy for achieving carbon neutrality follows these principles:\n\n**Calculate our footprint across our value chain:** Our responsibility extends beyond our direct operations to product-related emissions. That\u2019s why we model our emissions across the entire life cycle of our products \u2014 including the sourcing of raw materials, manufacturing, shipping, product use, and end-of-life processing. We use the results of our detailed carbon accounting to adjust our 2030 Climate Roadmap, which lays out our plan to become carbon neutral.\n\n**Set ambitious targets:** Our plan to reach neutrality by 2030 centers around our strategy to reduce emissions by 75 percent, relative to our fiscal year 2015 carbon footprint. This reduction aligns with what current climate science shows is necessary to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C. We plan to invest in high-quality carbon removal projects to address the remaining emissions, prioritizing nature-based solutions. And by focusing on emissions reduction, we\u2019re tackling the transformative work of making low-carbon products.\n\n**Match solutions to sources:** For each activity within our value chain, we seek out decarbonization actions that tie to the source of those emissions. For example, we\u2019ll look to reduce emissions from electricity using renewable electricity and emissions from transportation using alternative fuels and lower-carbon modes of transport. By matching solutions to carbon sources, we will do our part to decarbonize the economy.\n\n**Make environmental progress good for our business:** We are proving every day that there is no trade-off between what is good for the planet and what is good for business. That means that we seek out climate solutions that are cost-competitive, offer a financial return, or benefit our customers \u2014 for example, creating investment funds for clean energy and nature-based solutions, designed to deliver both environmental benefits and financial returns. And when we design products to be energy efficient and use recycled content, we view these as product features that add value for our customers. By underpinning our climate strategy with strong business principles, we aim to harness the power of markets to replicate our solutions at scale, creating an impact necessary to meet global reduction targets.\nExplore all solutions: Reaching our 2030 carbon goal will require scaling proven solutions that are available today, as well as exploring the solutions of the future. This includes facilitating the development of new technologies, like direct carbon-free aluminum smelting, creating novel financial instruments such as the Apple Restore Fund, advancing policies that support a low-carbon economy, and continuing to invest in research and development to enable decarbonizing our products by 2030.\n\nBe open: We are committed to disclosing our carbon footprint, climate strategy and progress, as well as climate-related risk. By sharing our approach, we aim to send clear signals to our partners and invite them to work with us. We also hope to empower our peers in their pursuit of carbon neutrality and engage investors through green bonds. This means sharing our setbacks with our successes. We recognize the difficulty of this work and acknowledge when our progress does not align with our projections. Our annual Environmental Progress Reports, as well as our response to the global disclosure nonprofit CDP, provide details on our progress.\n\nOur 10-year Climate Roadmap is addressing Apple\u2019s carbon footprint through five pillars:\n\n- **Low-carbon design**\n  We will design products and manufacturing processes to be less carbon-intensive through thoughtful material selection, increased material efficiency, and greater product energy efficiency.\n\n- **Energy efficiency**\n  We will increase energy efficiency at our facilities and in our supply chain by finding opportunities, such as retrofitting, to reduce energy use.\n\n- **Renewable electricity**\n  We will maintain our use of 100 percent renewable electricity for our facilities and transition our entire supply chain to 100 percent clean, renewable sources of electricity.\n\n- **Direct emissions abatement**\n  We will reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions in our facilities and our supply chain through process innovation, emissions abatement, and the use of non-fossil-based low-carbon fuels.\n\n- **Carbon removal**\n  Working in parallel with our emissions reduction efforts, we will scale up investments in carbon removal projects, including nature-based solutions that protect and restore ecosystems around the world.\n\nConsider underrepresented communities: Low-income and historically marginalized communities too often bear the brunt of the effects of climate change. So we\u2019re pursuing ways to directly consider these communities in our climate program \u2014 like with the Apple Impact Accelerator, which aims to bolster equity and foster opportunity for Black-, Hispanic/Latinx-, and Indigenous-owned businesses in the environmental sector. We\u2019re advocating for greater access to clean energy and investing in renewable energy projects in emerging markets. And we\u2019re targeting carbon removal projects that aim to improve the livelihoods of local and Indigenous communities.\nThis past year we intensified our efforts to reduce Apple\u2019s emissions. In fiscal year 2021, we avoided over 23 million metric tons of emissions across all scopes. Initiatives that we\u2019ve been growing for years \u2014 like sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity for our facilities, transitioning suppliers to clean energy, and using low-carbon materials in products \u2014 yielded indisputable results.\n\nThanks to this work, we\u2019ve begun to decouple business growth from emissions: While our revenue grew 33 percent, our emissions grew by less than 5 percent. To mitigate this increase in emissions, we applied an additional 0.6 million tons of renewable energy credits (RECs) and 0.5 million metric tons of carbon offsets to proportionally cover electricity use and direct emissions, respectively, across our value chain. This represents a short-term bridging solution as we grow our carbon reduction programs to meet the scale of the challenge.\n\nApple\u2019s comprehensive carbon footprint\n\nThis past year we intensified our efforts to reduce Apple\u2019s emissions.

This represents a short-term bridging solution as we grow our carbon reduction programs to meet the scale of the challenge.\nProgress toward net zero\n\nOur plan to become carbon neutral by 2030 centers around a 75 percent emissions reduction target, compared with our fiscal year 2015 footprint. We plan to address residual emissions through carbon removals. Already, we\u2019ve reduced our gross carbon footprint by 40 percent since fiscal year 2015. However, in recent years we have seen our footprint level out with the substantial growth of our business. We continue to scale the projects underpinning our 2030 Climate Roadmap, in order to yield further reductions in the medium term.\n\n* Error bars: We\u2019re continuously refining our methodology to improve our carbon footprint estimate. However, there is uncertainty inherent to modeling product-related carbon emissions, which we\u2019ve illustrated through error bars in this graphic.\n\n** Future emissions: Future emissions, including offsets and removals, are displayed as a linear trend to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2030. Actual future emissions will likely not be linear.\nWe\u2019re carbon neutral for our corporate emissions\n\nSince April 2020, we have been carbon neutral for our corporate emissions, including direct emissions (scope 1), electricity-related emissions (scope 2), as well as emissions from business travel and employee commute (scope 3). To reach neutrality, we focused on driving energy efficiency improvements and transitioning our facilities to 100 percent renewable electricity, which we achieved in 2018. These programs have reduced our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 67 percent, even as our business grew. We\u2019ve addressed the remaining scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as scope 3 emissions from business travel and employee commute (for a total of 167,000 metric tons) by securing high-quality carbon credits from projects that protect and restore forests, wetlands, and grasslands.\n\nHow we measure our footprint\n\nWe calculate our comprehensive carbon footprint using a life cycle\u2013based approach. Apple-specific data drives many of our most critical calculations; in cases where that data isn\u2019t available, we rely on secondary sources, including industry averages. We continually refine our model to include new sources of product life cycle data \u2014 and offer a more accurate and transparent assessment of our footprint. Our comprehensive carbon footprint and our methodology are verified by a third party each year to help ensure accuracy and transparency (see Appendix C). Improving the accuracy of our carbon footprint is an ongoing process \u2014 as we learn more, we revise our roadmap to incorporate new information. And, as our data improves, we will continue to refine our emissions accounting for previous years, as well as our projections.\n\nWe\u2019re evaluating climate risks\n\nWe\u2019ve conducted a climate scenario analysis to help us better understand the potential physical and transition effects of climate change. To align with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, we considered a range of future scenarios, including a scenario below 2\u00b0C. And we assessed geographies around the world to capture both corporate and supplier activities. The analysis highlighted how our renewable energy program and carbon neutrality goals could contribute to our corporate resiliency. It also provided environmental data that we consider in developing business strategies, including considerations around supply chain diversification, as well as safeguarding our global assets.\n\nWe\u2019re committed to managing regulatory, reputational, and market risks related to climate change. For more information on these climate-related risks and Apple\u2019s governance of these risks, read our 2021 CDP submission (PDF).\n\nWe\u2019re carbon neutral for our corporate operations, having reduced scope 1 and 2 emissions by 67% since 2011\nLow-carbon design\n\nApple sells hundreds of millions of products each year. Each product represents an opportunity to reduce our carbon footprint \u2014 small changes can yield enormous results. Our carbon footprint helps us identify opportunities to reduce the carbon intensity of our product designs. We are working to transition to materials from recycled sources and those made using low-carbon energy. We prioritize the materials and components that account for significant portions of our carbon emissions, so that the choices we make product-by-product can scale toward reducing our overall footprint.\n\nImproving material and manufacturing efficiency\n\nLess means more when it comes to our approach to materials and how we process them. By reducing the amount of materials used to make our products, we reduce the emissions from transporting and processing these materials, and limit the amount of scrap generated along the way. And as we progress toward our 2030 carbon neutrality goal, we continue to investigate new materials and new ways to manufacture efficiently.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to improve the carbon efficiency of the integrated circuits we use in our products \u2014 components we\u2019ve prioritized because they are carbon-intensive. Integrated circuits perform vital functions in electronic devices, yet require significant energy to manufacture. With the Apple M1 chip, we\u2019ve created a more efficiently designed chip built specifically for Mac devices. For example, switching to the Apple M1 chip for the 13-inch MacBook Pro reduced the energy needed to manufacture and use the device, driving down the product\u2019s carbon footprint by over 8 percent.\n\nTo take these efforts one step further, in October 2021, Apple became the first public company to join the Sustainable Semiconductor Technologies and Systems research program of Imec, a world-leading research and innovation hub in nanoelectronics and digital technologies. Our goal in collaborating is twofold: to improve the data associated with integrated circuit production, from end to end; and to use improved data and shared expertise to identify carbon reduction opportunities for the entire integrated circuits industry.\n\nAnd we continue to investigate new opportunities for improved efficiency across our product manufacturing processes. In 2021, we invested in research and development projects aimed at creating less waste in the processing of materials, reducing machining time and the associated energy used, more efficiently transforming material into the shapes we need, and maximizing recovery and reprocessing of manufacturing scrap. Once successfully developed, we plan to deploy these improved processes at scale at our supplier facilities.\nUsing recycled materials to lower our product footprint\n\nMaterial selection is another way to reduce the carbon footprint of our products. Our strategy is to transition to materials manufactured using low-carbon energy and recycled content. We\u2019ve prioritized materials and components that make up a large part of our carbon footprint to move us closer to our goal of product carbon neutrality.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen clear progress with aluminum, which in 2015 represented over a quarter of our product manufacturing footprint. We\u2019ve continued to expand our use of 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosures of a number of products: All iPad models in our lineup now use 100 percent recycled aluminum in their enclosures \u2014 joining Apple Watch Series 7, Apple Watch SE, MacBook Air, Mac mini, and the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro devices. For products released in 2021 that had enclosures made with primary aluminum, we prioritized the use of aluminum smelted using low-carbon sources of electricity rather than fossil fuels \u2014 for a lower carbon impact. These changes alone have decreased the carbon emissions associated with our use of aluminum by 68 percent since 2015.\n\nWe\u2019re also making progress in how we source recycled aluminum. The material we derive from our manufacturing scrap provides high-quality aluminum with fewer associated carbon emissions than newly mined materials. And we\u2019re expanding our sourcing to include post-consumer recycled aluminum from building and construction scrap that meets the high standards our products require. These emissions reduction efforts have driven down our aluminum-related emissions to less than 9 percent of our product manufacturing footprint, compared with 27 percent in 2015.\n\nAll these products contain 100% recycled aluminum enclosures\n\nBy switching to recycled and low-carbon aluminum, our carbon emissions associated with aluminum have decreased by 68 percent since 2015.\n\nRead more about how we plan to address emissions from our customers\u2019 use of our Apple products on page 26.\nDriving product energy efficiency\n\nWe approach low carbon product design by working to enhance performance, while pursuing energy efficiency. Product energy use accounts for 22 percent of our gross carbon footprint \u2014 and has an impact on the individual energy use of each of our customers. This is why we\u2019ve set aggressive targets to reduce our products\u2019 energy usage. We approach this challenge in the earliest phases of design, taking a holistic view of each product from how efficiently software operates to the power requirements of individual components.\n\nWith each generation of products, we make improvements to energy efficiency. The transition to Apple silicon on Mac devices, for example, continues to drive these improvements \u2014 the Mac mini consumes up to 60 percent less energy while in active use than the previous generation.7 We\u2019ve cut the product energy use across all major product lines by more than 70 percent since 2008 through our energy efficiency improvements.8 And Apple products are consistently rated by ENERGY STAR, which sets specifications that reflect the 25 percent most energy-efficient devices on the market. In fiscal year 2021, over 99 percent of Apple eligible products, by revenue, received an ENERGY STAR rating for superior energy efficiency.9 And over 99 percent of Apple eligible products, by revenue, met the requirements for EPEAT registration.10 EPEAT, another environmental rating system for electronic products, considers energy efficiency as well as a number of other environmental criteria.\n\nProduct energy efficiency\n\nOver the course of a year, Mac Studio will use up to 1000 kilowatt-hours less energy than a high-end PC desktop.11\n\nMac mini uses up to 60 percent less energy while in active use than the previous generation, thanks to the use of Apple silicon.12\n\niPhone 13 uses 54 percent less energy than the U.S. Department of Energy requirements for battery charger systems.13\nOur energy efficiency goals extend well beyond our products. We\u2019re focused on using less energy across our operations, beginning with how we design, operate, and maintain our facilities. And we continue these same efforts into our supply chain, which benefits the communities where our suppliers operate: Drawing less energy from electrical grids \u2014 many of which still rely heavily on fossil fuels \u2014 helps reduce local air pollution and improve air quality for nearby communities.\n\nEnergy efficiency is also essential to meeting our 2030 carbon neutrality goal. So we track and monitor energy use across our operations and supply chain, conducting audits to find opportunities to work more efficiently. And we view our energy use holistically, from the point of design to the point of manufacture.\n\nOperating Apple facilities efficiently\n\nFinding ways to avoid using energy in the first place is the central focus of our energy efficiency program. We consider natural gas and electricity usage at each site \u2014 our offices, data centers, R&D facilities, and retail stores \u2014 auditing how we perform and, when needed, using best practices for energy management to reduce our loads. And we tailor the design of new buildings to our occupants\u2019 and lab users\u2019 specific needs. This approach helps ensure that our facilities are utilized efficiently and productively.\n\nThere are significant opportunities to save energy in retrocommissioning buildings that Apple already occupies or operates, including energy-intensive facilities like data centers. We audit the performance of buildings around the world, and then deploy identified reduction measures. Retrocommissioning focuses on building controls, emphasizing energy use reduction and operational efficiency.\n\nFor example, we conducted a comprehensive retrocommissioning of one section of our campus in Cupertino, California, over the past several years. This effort was a partnership between our Apple Energy and Controls teams with significant support from the local energy utility. In the site audit, we uncovered several opportunities for energy efficiency, including optimizing HVAC scheduling and start sequences, and improving outside air economizer operation. These adjustments resulted in energy savings of over 670,000 kilowatt-hours per year, with a simple payback of just under four months.\n\nData centers are traditionally energy-intensive, requiring significant resources to cool the heat-generating equipment. That\u2019s why we\u2019re continuously monitoring and improving upon the controls for our cooling systems. This retrospective view often enables us to increase cooling capacity of our existing facility, thereby maximizing the amount of servers within our data center footprint.\n\nWe further improved energy efficiency at data centers by developing a specification requiring our servers to be powered by high-efficiency power supplies \u2014 exceeding even the efficiency requirements for ENERGY STAR certification. We deployed these high-performance power supplies to hundreds of thousands of servers in 2021, resulting in over 4 million kilowatt-hours per year in energy savings.\n\nMeasurement is critical to maintaining building energy performance. We continue to develop our system of energy tracking and benchmarking, which includes data from utility meters that continuously monitor 15-minute electricity and daily natural gas energy consumption. This method helps us identify performance issues at our sites early. We can then take corrective action to restore building system efficiencies and actively manage our energy footprint.\n\nWhen designing new facilities, we incorporate energy efficiency principles early in the process. We look at each location\u2019s conditions, planning for local temperature, humidity, and light. As each site becomes operational, we monitor how well we\u2019re performing and make needed adjustments.\nIn fiscal year 2021, our energy efficiency program avoided an additional 15.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and 27,000 therms of natural gas per year through adjustments made to 7.1 million square feet of new and existing buildings. Together, these new initiatives reduced total energy use by 7 percent in targeted buildings and will avoid an additional 6,100 metric tons of CO2e per year. Combined with ongoing energy savings from past years, we are now cumulatively saving over 60,000 metric tons of CO2e in fiscal year 2021. In addition to these savings, Apple further reduced its energy use by adjusting lighting and climate controls during the periods of reduced occupancy resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.14\n\nA more energy-efficient supply chain\n\nThe energy used to manufacture Apple products accounts for 70 percent of Apple\u2019s gross carbon footprint. To address this impact, we\u2019re collaborating closely with our suppliers to prioritize energy reductions and efforts to shift to renewable energy sources.\n\nWe launched our Supplier Energy Efficiency Program in 2015 with the goal of helping suppliers optimize their facilities and operations to use as little energy as possible. Finding energy efficiencies reduces the energy intensity of manufacturing, which translates to reduced direct carbon emissions. We provide guidance designed to help suppliers uncover opportunities for energy efficiency. We also assist them with assessments and technical support where appropriate. Typical projects may include replacing outdated or inefficient heating, cooling, and lighting systems; repairing compressed air leaks; and recovering waste heat.\n\nWe\u2019ve focused our efforts on the impact of some of our most popular products. One example is our three-year initiative to improve the efficiency of iPhone manufacturing. Collectively, the six participating supplier facilities achieved their goal of 20 percent reductions by the end of 2020 compared with the 2017 baseline. In addition, final assembly sites for AirPods, iPad, and Apple Watch all launched multiyear energy reduction initiatives in 2020.\n\nWhile the program has resulted in significant energy savings since launching, scaling it across Apple\u2019s entire manufacturing supply chain remains a challenge, because of the level of support we provide to individual suppliers. To address this challenge, we\u2019ve focused on improving measurement and data collection, capacity building, and access to funding opportunities.\n\nReducing energy use begins with measuring and understanding the carbon footprint of one\u2019s business. Since 2019, as part of Apple\u2019s Supplier Code of Conduct, we\u2019ve required our suppliers to regularly identify sources of emissions, measure their scope 1 and scope 2 carbon emissions, and make this information available to Apple as needed.15 By understanding the sources and quantity of a supplier\u2019s carbon emissions, we are able to provide resources to support the supplier in creating an action plan with the goal of becoming optimally energy efficient.\n\nWe also provide broad support to suppliers through workshops and trainings, including multiday classroom trainings for employees, resulting in plans for energy efficiency measures to be implemented at their respective facilities. We continue to expand the support we provide to suppliers as they build more energy-efficient systems, through new training and educational materials, and increased access to funding opportunities \u2014 like the Asia Green Fund, which Apple launched in 2019 to help provide energy efficiency expertise and finance capital-intensive energy efficiency projects. To date, US$8.5 million of investments have been made in supplier efficiency projects using the Asia Green Fund.\n\nWorking with our suppliers to reduce their energy consumption, we avoided more than 1.15 million metric tons of carbon from manufacturing Apple products in fiscal year 2021. That year, more than 100 supplier facilities participated in our Supplier Energy Efficiency Program, actively tracking and reporting on more than 2000 projects \u2014 a 39 percent increase since the prior year.\nRenewable electricity\n\nWe\u2019re at a pivotal moment in addressing climate change. Renewable energy is poised to replace fossil fuels as the future of electricity. Its adoption means cleaner air, stronger economies, and lower carbon emissions.\n\nApple has generated or sourced 100 percent renewable electricity for its corporate operations since 2018 and we are now committed to transitioning our entire supply chain to 100 percent renewable electricity as well.\n\nAs we grow, we continue to bring new renewable electricity projects online around the world. In the long term, these projects provide more cost-effective energy with less price volatility. Renewable electricity can offer a competitive advantage by providing power to our operations, as well as those of our suppliers, with greater control over energy supply and reduced exposure to cost fluctuations. And by adopting green technologies, we are in a unique position with our suppliers to drive environmental action and support our goal of carbon neutrality by 2030.\n\nOur approach is twofold. We find ways to consume energy more efficiently, and we seek out opportunities to transition to renewable sources that support our goal of 100 percent renewable electricity across our operations and supply chain.\n\nWith the renewable energy we source, we aim to achieve positive impacts. Before we engage in an energy project, we evaluate it with a holistic view of its potential environmental and social impact. Whenever possible, we focus on creating new renewable electricity projects, going above and beyond what might be available on the local grid. We also follow stringent accountability standards to verify our clean energy projects.\n\nSince 2018, Apple has sourced all of the electricity for its facilities from 100 percent renewable energy. The 200-megawatt Montague wind farm in Oregon is one of Apple\u2019s largest projects and supports our Prineville data center.\nMaintaining 100% renewable electricity for Apple facilities\n\nOur retail stores, data centers, and offices around the world currently source 100 percent renewable electricity. We are proud of this accomplishment \u2014 and as we grow, we\u2019re working diligently to maintain this benchmark. We\u2019ve focused our efforts to source renewables around several key pillars: creating new renewable energy projects, undertaking projects that deliver clear benefits to local communities, and supporting renewable energy innovations.\n\nCreating new projects\n\nWe focus on creating new renewable electricity projects. New projects require investment \u2014 whether in the form of direct ownership, equity investments, or long-term power purchase agreements. In total, Apple-created renewable sources account for over 90 percent of the renewable electricity our facilities use \u2014 around 1.5 gigawatts currently in use.\n\nWe define \u201cApple-created\u201d projects to include:\n\n- **Direct ownership**\n  (~9 percent of Apple-created projects)\n  We build our own projects, including solar, biogas fuel cells, and low-impact hydro projects, where feasible, to provide renewable electricity.\n\n- **Equity investment**\n  (~3 percent of Apple-created projects)\n  We invest capital in new solar PV or wind projects in some markets, matching the renewable energy generated with our energy use.\n\n- **Long-term renewable energy contracts**\n  (~87 percent of Apple-created projects)\n  We sign long-term contracts for renewable electricity when needed. Through power purchase agreements, virtual power purchase agreements, and other forms of long-term commitments, we help support new, local, and primarily solar PV and wind projects in line with our renewable energy-sourcing standards.\n\nTo cover any gaps in our renewable energy needs beyond what\u2019s provided by Apple-created projects (about 4.5 percent of our total corporate load in fiscal year 2021), we directly purchase renewable electricity through available utility green energy programs. Colocation facility vendors also supply about 3.5 percent of our total load of renewable energy. And in certain situations, we purchase RECs \u2014 for example, when we need to cover usage over the short term, before a renewable energy project comes online or when there\u2019s a lack of availability of renewable energy projects in-region. These RECs, which account for about 2 percent of our total load, must be tied to recently constructed projects, be Green-e Energy certified, where available, and share the same power grid as the Apple facility they support. These purchases are subject to the same standards as our Apple-created renewables. Appendix C provides additional details on Apple\u2019s renewable energy solutions.\n\nSupporting social impact\n\nPower for Impact\u2122, the program we launched in 2019, continues to provide local communities with needed energy resources. With funding from Apple, local communities and organizations gain access to cost-effective energy. At the same time, Apple retains the projects\u2019 environmental attributes, benefiting the community, our company, and the environment. Apple is currently supporting 10 renewable electricity projects around the world, including in the Philippines, Thailand, and South Africa. For more information, read more about Power for Impact on page 27.\nAdvancing renewable electricity through innovation\n\nWe\u2019ve continued to pursue innovations in how we create and use renewable electricity, including through investments in energy storage.\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, a Denmark-based wind energy project that Apple had supported became operational. It features two 200-meter-tall turbines, the world\u2019s largest, that are expected to produce 62 gigawatt-hours each year \u2014 enough to power almost 20,000 homes. The power produced onsite will support Apple\u2019s data center in Viborg, with all surplus energy going into the Danish grid. The project will also act as a test site for powerful offshore wind turbines. Apple\u2019s long-term virtual power purchase agreement provides the revenue certainty that made the project financially feasible.\n\nTo help address the intermittency in renewable electricity production, we\u2019ve invested in utility-scale storage in California and in research on new energy storage technologies. The California storage project \u2014 an industry-leading grid-scale energy storage project capable of storing 240 megawatt-hours of electricity \u2014 came online in fiscal year 2021. This project supports our 130-megawatt California Flats solar farm that provides all of our renewable energy in California, by storing excess energy generated during the day and deploying it when it is most needed.\n\nWe\u2019re also continuing to support biological methanation research at Aarhus University, Denmark, which explores the production of synthetic methane for storage in the existing gas grid. In this process, bacteria consumes both hydrogen produced from excess renewable energy and captured carbon dioxide to produce methane, the principal component of natural gas. Methane produced from renewables is a versatile energy carrier that can be used as a fuel source in households, industry, and transportation.\nTransitioning our suppliers to renewable electricity\n\nElectricity usage in our supply chain is the single greatest contributor to our carbon emissions. That\u2019s why our efforts to facilitate the transition of our entire supply chain to renewable electricity are essential to reaching our 2030 goal of carbon neutrality. While this is a global issue, the impacts are experienced locally. Bringing renewable energy online with our suppliers and displacing fossil fuels helps decarbonize power grids and improve local air quality. This work presents challenges: technical and regulatory barriers, capital requirements, and lack of awareness on where to find and access high-quality and cost-effective solutions.\n\nWe continue to experience tremendous progress toward our goal of transitioning our manufacturing supply chain to 100 percent renewable electricity by 2030. As of March 2022, 213 manufacturing partners in 25 countries have committed to 100 percent renewable energy for Apple production. We\u2019ve targeted carbon-intensive suppliers or those that represent a large portion of Apple\u2019s direct spend with suppliers. But the platform we\u2019ve built can support suppliers of any size. To that end, both large and small suppliers have committed to 100 percent renewable electricity for Apple production. Over 70 percent of companies on Apple\u2019s Supplier List \u2014 those suppliers that make up 98 percent of Apple\u2019s direct spend for materials, manufacturing, and assembly of our products worldwide \u2014 have committed to 100 percent renewable electricity. In addition, many other smaller suppliers have also made these commitments. In total, the Supplier Clean Energy Program now has almost 16 gigawatts of clean energy commitments, of which nearly two-thirds is already operational.\n\nTo cover emissions even further upstream, we have already invested directly in nearly 500 megawatts of solar and wind projects in China and Japan \u2014 and we plan to continue to invest in renewable energy projects to cover the load of suppliers we cannot reach directly. Beyond 2030, we believe that even our upstream suppliers will be in a position to transition to renewable electricity.\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, the 10.3 gigawatts of renewable energy already online in Apple\u2019s supply chain generated 18.1 million megawatt-hours of clean energy, avoiding 13.9 million metric tons of carbon emissions \u2014 a 62 percent increase over fiscal year 2020.17\n\nFor more information about which suppliers have joined Apple in transitioning to 100% clean energy, read our 2022 Supplier Clean Energy Update (PDF).\nOur Supplier Energy Efficiency and Supplier Clean Energy Programs work hand in hand to reduce the energy used in our supply chain and help transition the remaining electricity to renewable sources. We measure progress and account for emissions generated in our supply chain as part of our carbon footprint. But we also know that we can achieve even more significant climate impact by providing a model for other companies to follow with their suppliers, helping to reduce emissions beyond our industry.\n\nOur experience in transitioning our facilities to 100 percent renewable electricity gives us knowledge we can share. And we help break down barriers through engagement, innovative funding structures, and advocacy of clean energy\u2013friendly policies.\n\n**Galvanizing internal champions**\n\nApple employees are passionate about the environment and driven to help meet our 2030 carbon neutrality goal. We\u2019re empowering supplier-facing employees with the tools they need to support this goal and speed a supplier\u2019s transition to renewable electricity. It starts with data and transparency. We track the progress of our suppliers, including those just beginning to learn about renewable electricity and others that are well on their way to using 100 percent renewable electricity. We\u2019ve also created internal trainings and crafted a simple engagement process, backed by resources for both Apple employees and our suppliers. By connecting our suppliers with resources and providing transparency on supplier progress, our teams are scaling impact across our supply chain.\n\n**Supporting supplier capacity**\n\nWe share the experience gained through our transition to 100 percent renewable electricity with our suppliers. We introduce suppliers to resources and training materials with country-specific information to guide them in their transition to renewables. These tools are available through our Supplier Clean Energy Portal. We also educate suppliers through advanced and customized trainings with leading experts. And we support the creation and growth of renewable energy industry associations that our suppliers can join to learn about local opportunities.\n\nNew clean energy commitments from suppliers help support Apple\u2019s goal to be carbon neutral for its supply chain and products by 2030. Corning Incorporated utilizes clean power from Duke Energy Sustainable Solutions\u2019 Conetoe, North Carolina, solar installation as part of its commitment to power its Apple operations with 100 percent renewable electricity.\nLong-standing energy structures can make it difficult to bring new renewable energy online in some regions, prompting some of our suppliers to maximize proven renewable energy solutions \u2014 like onsite solar installations. Others have leveraged new purchasing methods, created renewable energy businesses, or even participated in some of the world\u2019s largest and most innovative renewable energy deals.\n\n**Expanding access to renewable electricity**\n\nThe transition to renewables means helping our suppliers find energy solutions and make the right investments to address their specific needs. When we face barriers to accessing cost-effective clean energy, we innovate. One such innovation, the China Clean Energy Fund, enables Apple and our suppliers to invest in clean energy. As of March 2022, the fund has invested in 465 megawatts of renewable electricity projects. We also connect suppliers with opportunities to buy renewable energy directly from project developers and utilities as those models emerge around the globe.\n\n**Advocating for policy change**\n\nGovernment policies and rules can present some of the largest barriers to transitioning to renewables. We lend our voice and stand with other companies and NGOs to break down policy barriers to achieve thriving clean energy markets with, for example, enhanced grid resiliency and greater energy innovation. Across regions where our suppliers operate, we engage with policymakers to support renewable energy that is cost-effective, accessible to companies, and sourced from high-quality projects with a material impact on local markets. We recognize that to transition to renewable energy effectively, clean energy investments need to make financial sense. However, carbon-intensive energy sources, like coal and gas, often have an unfair price advantage because of explicit subsidies and the ignored costs of externalities \u2014 like air pollution and carbon emissions. So we are encouraging governments not to subsidize or expand carbon-intensive infrastructure that will inhibit competition and discourage the development of new technologies like renewable energy and advanced energy storage technologies.\n\nWe\u2019re particularly focused on encouraging clean energy policies in countries where we and our suppliers operate. In Vietnam, we continue to encourage the government to adopt ambitious targets for renewable energy development in Power Development Plan 8, and to enshrine net zero goals announced by the government into national legislation. We support a timely rollout of a cost-competitive direct power purchase agreement (DPPA) pilot program there. We\u2019ve also supported policies in South Korea to develop renewable corporate procurement options such as power purchase agreements (PPA), green pricing auctions, and RECs that will be impactful and cost-effective. In Japan, we continue to support expansion of corporate procurement options such as more cost-competitive offsite PPAs, development of a virtual PPA system, as well as improved transparency and corporate access to procure Non-Fossil Certificates. We\u2019ve also called for enhanced climate ambition and renewable energy deployment in the nation\u2019s Basic Energy Plan and Nationally Determined Contribution (Japan\u2019s plan to reduce emissions in furtherance of the Paris Agreement), and for decarbonization policies to prioritize support for new technologies that can fully account for reducing emissions across their life cycle.\n\n**Product use**\n\nThe electricity our customers use to charge their Apple devices represents 22 percent of Apple\u2019s gross carbon footprint. While increased energy efficiency helps drive down emissions from product use, we are also developing a strategy to address the emissions that remain.\n\nWhen Apple committed to running our business on 100 percent renewable electricity in 2013 \u2014 a goal we met for our facilities in 2018 \u2014 we were early leaders in this transition to renewable energy. Over the last decade, as more companies have adopted 100 percent renewable electricity targets aimed at matching the electricity used with the renewable energy generated on an annual basis, it has become increasingly clear that not all renewable electricity is created equal from a carbon reduction and social impact standpoint. As we address emissions tied to the electricity our products use globally, our guiding principles focus on (1) exploring innovative solutions to minimize carbon emissions from product use, including energy efficiency; (2) building renewable energy projects aimed at maximizing carbon reductions and social impact; and (3) engaging with our customers to educate and provide opportunities to support the decarbonization of the grid.\n\nWe are continuing to develop our strategy and we will provide updates on our progress.\nAccess to clean energy sources not only benefits the climate, it can create opportunities within communities. This is the idea driving Power for Impact, an initiative we launched in 2019 to provide under-resourced communities with renewable power while supporting economic growth and social impact.\n\nThe program funds mutually beneficial clean energy projects, giving local communities and organizations access to cost-effective energy while Apple retains the environmental attributes of each project.\n\nApple is supporting 10 new renewable projects around the world through its Power for Impact program:\n\n**Colombia:** Apple is helping to bring online a rooftop solar power system at the Santa Ana Hospital Infantil. The money saved on energy bills will allow the hospital to purchase more equipment and medications. A rooftop solar installation at Ciudad Don Bosco, a nonprofit that provides educational and social services for under-resourced youth, will help the group advance its sustainable development goals.\n\n**Israel:** Apple is supporting the Nitzana Educational Eco-Village, a community for at-risk youth, with solar installations to help lower electricity costs. The savings will help enhance educational experiences for youth from various backgrounds.\n\n**Nigeria:** Apple will support the development of a solar power system to serve a primary healthcare center in the state of Ondo, as well as 200 households in the surrounding region.\n\n**Philippines:** Apple will help fund an educational institution that provides scholarships to high-achieving, under-resourced students by offsetting electricity expenses through a new rooftop solar installation in Central Luzon.\n\n**South Africa:** Apple is bringing electricity to over 3500 households that previously lacked access. The company will also help reduce electricity costs for the Pioneer School for the Visually Impaired by funding rooftop solar installations at three schools across South Africa.\n\n**Thailand:** Apple is participating in an effort to replace the use of polluting diesel fuel for a remote fishing village that relies on refrigerators to maintain the quality of its fish products. We are increasing local renewable energy production and battery storage to help ensure reliable access to electricity.\n\n**United States:** Apple is working with the Oceti Sakowin Power Authority, formed by six Sioux tribes to jointly develop tribal renewable energy resources by financing, developing, constructing, and operating power generation and transmission facilities for the wholesale market. This project is on track to create a large-scale wind power development in the Midwest.\n\n**Vietnam:** Apple will provide solar electricity for 20 schools around the country, and help teach thousands of children about sustainable development and STEM.\n\nPower for Impact is expanding access to clean, affordable power in different parts of the world. Apple will continue to focus on uplifting communities as it pursues its environmental goals.\nDirect emissions abatement\n\nSome materials that are integral to our products result in significant emissions. The same is true for certain manufacturing processes and the transportation of our products. To address these emissions we seek technological solutions, as well as emissions abatement, and switching to low-carbon fuels or modes of transport.\n\nRethinking how aluminum is made\n\nIn May 2018, Apple partnered with aluminum companies and the governments of Canada and Quebec to invest in Elysis \u2014 a joint venture to commercialize patented technology that eliminates direct greenhouse gas emissions from the traditional smelting process. This is a revolutionary advancement in the manufacturing of one of the world\u2019s most widely used metals.\n\nAs part of Apple\u2019s commitment to reducing the environmental impact of our products through innovation, we helped accelerate the development of this technology \u2014 by facilitating the joint partnership and providing initial funding and ongoing technical support. In spring 2022, Elysis announced it had built out a commercial-scale prototype within its R&D center in Quebec \u2014 enabling Elysis to begin producing commercial-purity primary aluminum at scale. This milestone for the project prompted Apple to make an additional purchase of the aluminum, with plans to use it for iPhone SE. In 2019, Apple purchased the first-ever commercial batch of aluminum resulting from the joint venture, using it in the production of the 16-inch MacBook Pro.18\n\nAddressing fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions\n\nMany components essential to products like ours, including integrated circuit chips and display panels, currently rely on manufacturing processes that use fluorinated gases. We\u2019re partnering closely with key manufacturers to prevent these gases from being released into the atmosphere, where they have high global warming potential. First, we encourage suppliers to optimize manufacturing processes \u2014 reducing the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases. Then we ask suppliers to deploy abatement technologies \u2014 curtailing the release of emissions from the gases that remain.\n\nTransporting products\n\nEach year, we ship hundreds of millions of products from our manufacturers to our consumers. We\u2019re shifting whenever possible toward less carbon-intensive shipping modes, such as rail and ocean. And we\u2019re seeking out technical innovations, including alternative fuels and electric vehicles. In fiscal year 2021, Apple avoided 180,000 metric tons of CO2e by shifting the mode of transport and reducing product weight through the removal of the power adapter from iPhone devices.\n\nIn Europe, we\u2019re working with carriers who are advancing \u201ccarbon neutral delivery\u201d using electric vehicles, including e-bikes and e-cars. These innovations help reduce our impact in the communities where our customers purchase our products. And by preferring vendors that offer low-carbon options, we signal the value of these options to us and reward those driving decarbonization in their industry.\n\nAt COP26, Apple joined the \u201cFirst Movers Coalition,\u201d a partnership between the World Economic Forum and the U.S. Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate to maintain our commitment to becoming a carbon-neutral company by 2030. The First Movers Coalition is a new platform for companies to harness their purchasing power and supply chains to create early markets for innovative clean energy technologies that are key for tackling the climate crisis \u2014 with a focus on sectors central to global decarbonization efforts, including aviation.\nThe focus of our 2030 Climate Roadmap is to reduce our emissions by 75 percent compared with 2015 levels. In addition, we will need to scale up carbon removal strategies to address the emissions that we can\u2019t yet avoid. This is consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which notes that all pathways limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C require carbon removal for unavoidable emissions.\\(^{19}\\)\n\nCarbon removal projects take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and store it in long-term carbon sinks \u2014 whether natural, like forests, wetlands, and grasslands, or geological, in formations such as saline aquifers or other suitable geological sites. We are exploring a range of carbon removal solutions to meet our 2030 carbon neutrality goal. In addition to removing carbon, nature-based carbon removal projects also offer important ecological and social benefits, such as preserving biodiversity and enhancing the resilience of ecosystems, while often providing economic development opportunities for local communities.\n\n**We\u2019re investing in nature**\n\nThe earth\u2019s trees, plants, and soils provide some of the greatest capabilities to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Carbon credits provide an opportunity to invest in these solutions, but carbon markets have not yet scaled to meet the recent increases in demand for these credits. That\u2019s why we are expanding nature-based investments to support our goal of achieving carbon neutrality across our full product life cycle by 2030. By investing in forests, grasslands, and wetlands, we support proven, scalable approaches to carbon removal \u2014 while supporting ecosystems and the livelihoods of local communities.\n\nWe believe that this can be done while achieving a financial and environmental return on our investment. That is why we partnered with Conservation International and Goldman Sachs to launch the Restore Fund. This innovative fund seeks to blend responsible forestry practices with carbon removal. We\u2019re working with forestry managers to create sustainably managed forests that optimize for both carbon and wood production, creating revenue from timber, and generating high-quality carbon credits. Apple will invest up to $200 million in projects that aim to remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it, all while meeting clear social and environmental impact criteria and offering a financial return. In its pilot phase, the Restore Fund has a goal of removing at least 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year.\n\nSince announcing the Restore Fund, together with Conservation International and Goldman Sachs, we have screened over a hundred projects to identify those with the most potential for restoration that also relieve pressure on existing natural forests. The projects we\u2019ve identified seek to maximize environmental impact, including carbon, hydrology, and habitat restoration. We\u2019ve also established strong relationships with forestry managers working on sustainable forestry around the world, who will be responsible for managing the projects. Finally, we\u2019re exploring innovative approaches to track the progress of our projects, such as the use of satellites to measure and verify the carbon removal impacts of the Restore Fund. And we work with independent auditors to help ensure the integrity of these projects.\n\nThe projects in the Restore Fund will align with international standards developed by organizations such as the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), the Climate, Community & Biodiversity Standard (CCBS), and the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Use of these international standards help ensure that the carbon stored in forests is being measured and reported to the highest standards, and that projects have the most up-to-date safeguards in place to mitigate risks to project performance. The projects we select will also have a meaningful positive impact on the livelihoods of local communities by bringing economic opportunities to often underserved rural economies. We will continue to focus on projects that protect lands with high conservation values.\n\nBy 2030, we aim to use initiatives like the Restore Fund to remove enough carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to cover the direct emissions across our value chain that we\u2019re unable to avoid directly. This fund is unique because it aims to change carbon removal from a cost to a profitable investment. By creating a fund that generates both a financial return as well as real and measurable carbon impact, we aim to drive broader change in the future \u2014 encouraging capital investment in carbon removal around the globe.\nHigh-quality carbon offsets as an interim solution\n\nWe plan to reach our goal of becoming carbon neutral across our entire value chain by 2030, using every solution at our disposal, including long-term carbon removal initiatives, like the Restore Fund. But as the projects in the Restore Fund come online, we\u2019re also working to address difficult-to-avoid emissions in the short term.\n\nSince April 2020 we have been carbon neutral for our corporate emissions. We started by reducing our corporate emissions through the use of 100 percent renewable electricity and energy efficiency efforts at our facilities. However, there are some activities where emissions remain difficult to avoid \u2014 including the use of natural gas in some of our buildings or the emissions from business air travel and employee commute. As the Restore Fund projects come online, we\u2019ve partnered with Conservation International to develop and invest in projects that generate carbon credits to cover our remaining corporate emissions. These projects include the protection and restoration of a 27,000-acre mangrove forest in Colombia, which is expected to sequester 1 million metric tons of CO\u2082 over the project\u2019s lifetime; the restoration of degraded savannas in the Chyulu Hills region of Kenya; and through investment in a \u201cmicro-forestry\u201d company that partners with and empowers tens of thousands of marginalized farmers to earn a living from sustainable tree farming. We retired 167,000 metric tons of carbon credits from the Chyulu Hills project in Kenya to maintain carbon neutrality for our corporate emissions in fiscal year 2021.\n\nWhile we did more than ever to reduce our emissions from our product life cycle in fiscal year 2021, our business also performed well, resulting in a small increase in our carbon footprint. To make up for the increase in direct emissions, we retired credits from the Chyulu Hills project described above, and purchased carbon credits from two additional projects to offset a total of 500,000 metric tons of direct emissions across our value chain. The first project, a REDD+ coastal conservation project in Guatemala, protects and conserves forests from deforestation and degradation. The second project aims to establish forests on about 46,000 hectares of barren land that is not otherwise in use across seven counties in the Guizhou Province of China. Both projects are certified to the same high standards that we require for projects in the Restore Fund, including VCS and CCBS.\n\nWe\u2019re protecting and restoring 27,000 acres of mangrove forests in Colombia. Mangroves play an important role in removing carbon from the atmosphere, as they can store up to ten times more carbon per acre than a typical terrestrial forest.\n\nLearn more about the nature-based solutions in Kenya and Colombia that we\u2019ve developed in partnership with Conservation International.\nAdvocating for strong climate policies\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re determined to do our part to fight climate change & believe transparency is an important part of this. Apple has publicly disclosed our greenhouse gas emissions for a decade, and we believe other companies should do the same,\u201d wrote Lisa P. Jackson, vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives at Apple, in a tweet on April 13, 2021.\n\nThis 38-word tweet marked a milestone with a large, public U.S. company calling for mandatory disclosures of global greenhouse gases across all emissions scopes. The statement also focused the discussion within industry and government toward greater transparency, and increased attention by regulators.\n\nIn May, Apple also became the first company to voice support for the enactment of the Clean Energy Standard (CES) that would decarbonize the power grid by 2035. In a discussion with Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, Jackson stressed that the opportunities that come with decarbonization must be inclusive: \u201cGovernment has to lead here when it comes to making sure that there\u2019s economic equity in the policies that are being promoted.\u201d\n\nAnd at the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2021, Apple called for bold government action on climate change, joining several new initiatives, including the First Movers Coalition, the Forest Investor Club, and the Clean Energy Demand Initiative.\n\nApple\u2019s climate policy advocacy centers on the following principles, each of which governs Apple\u2019s public policy positions on climate:\n\n**Set strong targets based on science**\nPolicymakers should set national or regional targets that seek to limit warming to no more than 1.5\u00b0C. These goals need to include interim targets and mechanisms to enforce short-term accountability. To meet these targets requires a price on carbon and parallel participation in international policy negotiation.\n\n**Disclose comprehensive emissions**\nMeasurement and disclosure are essential tools to reduce emissions. Rules governing the release of information covering all scopes of emissions, direct and indirect, across the value chain will help establish best practices and promote competition.\n\n**Create sector-specific policies**\nLimiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C is a goal that requires actions across the entire economy. Policies need to address sector-specific needs and facilitate the transition to decarbonize industries where there are challenges or there is a need for infrastructure to support the goal.\n\n**Support a green economy for all**\nClimate policies should support the development of the new green economy, with job opportunities focused on advancing clean innovation. Equity should be a guiding principle of policies supporting this economy. Communities that have been disproportionately impacted by climate change should benefit from the economic opportunities of potential solutions.\nResources\n\nRECYCLED\n\niPhone has guts\nGoals and progress\n\nWe\u2019re committed to making the most of the resources we use. This commitment includes our goal to one day make our products using only recycled and renewable materials, while we continue to source materials responsibly, whether from primary, recycled, or renewable sources. And the innovations we\u2019re pursuing to build long-lasting products and create improved recycling technologies play an important role. Each of these efforts helps conserve the earth\u2019s finite resources. And they also support our objective to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030, by helping reduce the carbon footprint of our products.\n\nUse only **recycled and renewable** materials in our products and packaging, and enhance material recovery\n\n- **8 products** released in fiscal year 2021 with 20 percent or more recycled content\n- In fiscal year 2021, we more than doubled our use of recycled tungsten, rare earth elements, and cobalt \u2014 and introduced certified recycled gold for the first time in an Apple product\n- **Our newest recycling machine, Taz, brings shredding to a new level**\n\nEliminate waste sent to landfill from our corporate facilities and our suppliers\n\n- All established final assembly and sub-assembly sites for Apple Watch Series 7 send zero waste to landfill\n\nEliminate plastics in our packaging **by 2025**\n\n- **75% less plastic** in packaging used across product lines compared with 2015\n- **No outer plastic wrap** was used in iPhone 13 packaging\n\nReduce water impacts in the manufacturing of our products, use of our services, and operation of our facilities\n\n- Our Prineville data center and 17 supplier facilities have been certified by Alliance for Water Stewardship for leading water management practices\nOur approach\n\nNatural resources make our work possible \u2014 and we take responsibility for how we source, use, and recycle the materials we rely on to create our products. As a starting point, this means sourcing responsibly, minimizing our freshwater use, and eliminating waste across our operations and those of our suppliers. But we\u2019re also seeking to redefine the overall resource footprint of our products. This requires broader engagement, through collaborations enabling the stewardship of shared resources.\n\nOur goal is to one day make products using only responsibly sourced recycled and renewable materials. We aim to build durable, long-lasting products that make the best use of the resources required to make them. And, in collaboration with leading recyclers, we\u2019re developing recycling strategies of the future for the end of each product\u2019s life. Through these engagements, we can support research and take on industry-wide challenges.\n\nWater is a vital resource that we rely on to manufacture products and run our offices, data centers, and stores. We take our stewardship responsibilities seriously in each community where we operate. This begins with optimizing how we use water, leveraging alternative and recycled sources of water, and managing our discharge responsibly. But our efforts go a step further. We\u2019re focused on working collectively with other companies, NGOs, and local governments to improve the health of the water basins, extending our efforts miles beyond our suppliers\u2019 facilities.\n\nWe\u2019re working to eliminate landfill waste. Reducing waste and increasing reuse and recycling is vital to conserve the world\u2019s resources. We aim to leave no waste behind in the communities in which we and our suppliers work, and to reduce the flow of waste to communities around the world that have disproportionately borne the burdens of waste disposal. Our progress is measured in how we decrease the amount of waste we create, innovate opportunities for reuse, and open up new opportunities to recycle in partnership with local businesses.\n\nProgress on all of our goals relies on collaborative efforts. Through direct engagement with suppliers, NGOs, recyclers, community stakeholders, and other innovators, we can advance \u2014 and reduce our carbon and material footprint by doing more with less.\n\nWithin resources, we focus on three main areas of impact\n\nMaterials\nTransitioning to only recycled or renewable materials in our products and packaging, and maximizing material efficiency, product longevity, and recovery.\n\nWater\nReducing water impacts in the manufacturing of our products, use of our services, and operation of our facilities. At the same time, transitioning to alternative sources, improving the quality of water we discharge, and protecting shared water resources.\n\nZero waste\nMinimizing overall waste generated and eliminating waste sent to landfill from our manufacturing supply chain as well as corporate offices, data centers, and retail stores.\nMaterials\n\nWe aim to have our products be part of thriving, responsible, circular supply chains \u2014 where finite material extraction is replaced by continual recycling and reuse. We\u2019re increasingly sourcing more of the materials we use from circular supply chains drawn from recycled content and renewable resources.\n\nOur goal is to one day achieve independence from mined resources. Extracting materials continuously from the earth is a carbon-intensive process and can have an impact in the regions from which these resources are derived. We\u2019re making progress toward this goal with each generation of new products \u2014 and we\u2019re doing so without sacrificing quality and durability. We\u2019re also pursuing innovations in recycling to enhance material recovery and support circular supply chains for ourselves and others.\n\nThis goal represents a significant challenge and a great opportunity to reduce our footprint. We see this with each change we make, whether a technological innovation or new supply chain. These developments affect the people who interact with our products, influence the markets in which we operate, and create change for broader global communities. And our actions carry results that extend beyond our business.\n\nWe\u2019re using three different levers to reduce our footprint and achieve circularity:\n\n**Sourcing and efficiency**\nSourcing recycled and renewable materials for our products and packaging, and using these materials more efficiently. And we source materials responsibly, whether from primary, recycled, or renewable sources.\n\n**Product longevity**\nMaking the most of the materials we use by designing long-lasting products. We design durable hardware, leverage software updates to extend functionality, provide convenient access to safe and high-quality repair services, and direct devices and parts to be refurbished or reused.\n\n**Product end-of-life**\nEnhancing product collection and recycling innovation, so we and others can use old devices as raw material sources for the future.\nSourcing and efficiency\n\nWe\u2019ve made progress in the past few years toward the goal of relying solely on recycled and renewable materials for our products and our packaging.\n\nThis has made it clear to markets that we place a value on the source of our materials, particularly those that do not deplete the earth\u2019s resources. Many partners have joined us in our efforts to move toward recycled and renewable content \u2014 and we look forward to engaging with many others as part of a broader global transition. And as we design new products, we continue to source materials responsibly and use materials more efficiently.\n\nLast year, we made progress across materials \u2014 from expanding our use of recycled rare earth elements to designing cameras with recycled gold. In September, we introduced iPhone 13, with more certified recycled materials than any previous version of iPhone. This included recycled rare earth elements, tin, tungsten, aluminum, and for the first time, certified recycled gold. We also introduced 100 percent recycled plastic in the mesh of the ear cushions of AirPods Max, as well as 100 percent recycled aluminum enclosures on every single model in the iPad lineup.\n\nAcross our business, we released eight products with more than 20 percent recycled content. The MacBook Air with M1 chip (2020) had the highest total \u2014 made with 44 percent recycled content device-wide, including 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure. These and other innovations helped us increase our use of recycled or renewable content to 18 percent of all the material shipped in products in fiscal year 2021. Suppliers have not only confirmed they sourced recycled material, but have also achieved third-party certification for more than half of this content, engaging organizations including UL LLC.\n\nThe amount of recycled material in our products is just one measure of our progress. We have prioritized 14 materials, evaluating their environmental, social, and supply impacts outlined in their Material Impact Profiles \u2014 including biodiversity factors. Some of the materials prioritized through this process include lower-mass but higher-impact materials. But by considering broader impacts, we know our efforts are going to the greatest benefit for the world. (See page 39 for the full list of our priority materials.)\n\nAs we source these priority materials, the lack of readily available recycled and renewable options presents a key obstacle. Apple teams are doing the work required to make this transition \u2014 seeking out sources of recycled and renewable content, building new supply chains, and enhancing industry transparency and traceability.\n\nAnd our teams, in collaboration with many diverse partners, are overcoming numerous challenges. Material performance is one example of this. With aluminum, we designed a new alloy that could incorporate recycled content and still meet our high performance standards. Traceability, the ability to trace materials back to their source, represents another challenge. For iPhone 13, we built our first exclusively recycled gold supply chain, which incorporated end-to-end traceability \u2014 unprecedented in the industry \u2014 allowing us to determine that only materials from recycled sources entered the supply chain. This effort allowed us to use 100 percent certified recycled gold in select components of iPhone for the first time.\n\nSome of the barriers we face are within our control, but others are further outside of Apple\u2019s direct control and require collective action. When we work collaboratively with those in the material space to overcome these, the effects can be felt beyond our business. We\u2019re helping create supply chains to serve not only our footprint. We\u2019re working to promote the availability of quality materials across geographies, ideally at a competitive cost.\nAs we work, we continue to uphold high standards. Our recycled and renewable material specifications follow standards set out by the international community. To ensure that these materials meet our standards, we require our suppliers to obtain third-party certifications. This measure helps us confirm that a material has been recycled or comes from a renewable source \u2014 one that can continually produce without depleting the earth\u2019s resources. As we introduce materials from new sources, we continue to evaluate each for its chemical safety. Through this process we\u2019re able to scale our use of materials that are better for the environment, while ensuring that they are also safe for use in our products.\n\nThis diligence carries over to sourcing. We obtain our resources responsibly, regardless of whether we are using primary or recycled materials. This approach is a necessary complement to our environmental efforts \u2014 and it draws from the same reliance on international standards. Our Responsible Sourcing Standards are based on leading international guidance, including the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) due diligence guidance. In 2021, 100 percent of the identified tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold, cobalt, and lithium smelters and refiners in Apple\u2019s supply chain participated in an independent third-party audit program. These audits are designed to assess and identify a broad range of risks, including social, environmental, human rights, and governance risks. We also continue to map, conduct additional due diligence, and facilitate independent third-party audits on other materials used in our products, such as graphite, nickel, and copper. As we build supply chains for recycled materials, we\u2019re partnering with the smelters and refiners identified through this process, as well.\n\nSince iPhone 12, we\u2019ve been making our Taptic Engines with 100 percent recycled tungsten.\n\nWe continue to engage with multiple industry initiatives as we focus on responsible sourcing and recycled content. For example, Apple serves on the steering committee of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) \u2014 part of the Responsible Business Alliance \u2014 which is one of the most utilized resources for companies from a range of industries that are working to address responsible mineral sourcing issues in their supply chains. We also collaborate with the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative and other industry organizations working to promote transparency across supply chains and establish additional auditing and due diligence systems.\n\nOur efforts to use recycled and renewable materials also support our climate goals, since our recycled content has a lower carbon footprint than primary materials. As we make this transition, we\u2019re working with policymakers to support international standards that enable the use of these materials globally.\nOur transition to certified recycled materials by product line\n\n- All products launched in calendar year include certified recycled content\n- Some products launched in calendar year include certified recycled content\n- No products launched in calendar year include certified recycled content\n- Recycled content not applicable*\n\n| Year | Plastic | Tin | Aluminum | Rare earth elements | Gold | Tungsten* |\n|------|---------|-----|----------|---------------------|------|----------|\n| 2017 |         |     |          |                     |      |          |\n| 2018 |         |     |          |                     |      |          |\n| 2019 |         |     |          |                     |      |          |\n| 2020 |         |     |          |                     |      |          |\n| 2021 |         |     |          |                     |      |          |\n\nProducts launched by calendar year\n\n*Material is considered \"not applicable\" as it is found only in small quantities in dispersed module applications.\nProgress across our priority materials\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, 18 percent of the material we shipped in products came from recycled and renewable sources. This milestone is part of our broader strategy focusing on 14 materials that account for more than 90 percent of the total product mass shipped to our customers.\n\nWe\u2019re making progress in transitioning these materials to recycled and renewable sources, while we continue to source materials responsibly. But, as we work, we\u2019re encountering challenges in creating circular supply chains.\n\nKey challenges to developing circular supply chains:\n\n| Technical properties | Availability and access | Transparency | Scale | Regulatory barriers |\n|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------|-------|---------------------|\n| The properties of a recycled or renewable material may differ from the primary material, which needs to be accounted for during product design. For example, select recycled plastics differ in properties from other plastics. The composition of other recycled materials can also be impacted by some level of contamination during the recycling process. | Supply of recycled and renewable materials can be constrained by the limited availability of scrap sources or production of renewable content. Even when supply exists in some locations around the world, these new suppliers need to be incorporated into supply chains for the material to be accessed. | Information about the source of materials \u2014 whether mined, recycled, or renewable \u2014 may not be readily available. | Materials for a single component can come from hundreds of different material suppliers, representing an exponential increase in effort as we scale the use of high-quality recycled or renewable materials across components and products. | Transboundary movement regulations \u2014 originally intended to create environmental protections \u2014 can inhibit the ability to recover materials from scrap, end-of-life products, and parts for use in new products. Read about our support of policies that enable movement of recovered materials to best-in-class recyclers in our feature on resource recovery policy. |\n\nHow we source materials:\n\nRecycled content\nCertified recycled content is sourced from recycled materials that have been independently verified by third parties to a standard that conforms with ISO 14021. We also account for recycled content that\u2019s confirmed by suppliers, but has not yet received third-party verification.\n\nResponsible sourcing\nApple\u2019s Responsible Sourcing of Materials Standard covers all primary and recycled materials. Our standard aligns with leading international standards, including the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (OECD Due Diligence Guidance).\n\nMaterial | Key challenges | Progress |\n|---------|---------------|----------|\n| Aluminum | Regulatory barriers, Technical properties, Scale | After creating a new aluminum alloy that incorporates recycled content without compromising product performance, we\u2019re now scaling recycled content across products. All iPad models in our lineup now use 100 percent recycled aluminum in their enclosures \u2014 joining Apple Watch Series 7, Apple Watch SE, MacBook Air, Mac mini, and the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro devices. Our iPhone 13 model incorporates recycled aluminum content, as well. Since recycled aluminum can have 1/40th the carbon footprint of aluminum from primary sources, this supports our pursuit of low-carbon designs. Overall in fiscal year 2021, 59 percent of the aluminum we shipped came from recycled sources, more than half of which was third-party certified. Our recycled material comes from several sources, including scrap from the manufacture of Apple products, and post-industrial sources. And as our supplier source recycled content, we encourage them to take the additional step to pursue third-party certifications for their recycled content. |\n| Cobalt | Regulatory barriers, Availability and access, Scale | In the fiscal year, 13 percent of the cobalt shipped in our products came from certified recycled sources on a mass-balance basis, including both post-industrial scrap and post-consumer scrap from end-of-life batteries. The cobalt from iPhone batteries disassembled by Daisy is being returned to the market. This more efficient and economical approach makes the material available to others beyond our supply chain. |\n| Material          | Key challenges                  | Progress                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Copper            | Technical properties            | Electronics applications require the use of high-performance copper. Yet even as challenges remain in identifying quality scrap sources, we are making progress. In March 2022, we introduced 100 percent recycled copper for the first time in any Apple product: Apple Studio Display and Mac Studio both use 100 percent recycled copper in the brass prongs of the power cord plug and AC inlet. We also continue testing 100 percent recycled copper in other applications to evaluate its technical properties and performance across product lines. In our printed circuit boards (PCBs) \u2014 another key use of copper \u2014 we\u2019re driving material efficiency by using foils that require less of the material and incorporating recycled copper, primarily from old power line cables. We\u2019re working to apply this same approach to other modules. |\n|                   | Supply chains                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|                   | Scale                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Glass             | Technical properties            | Recycled sources are scarce for the quality of glass we use in our products \u2014 and performance of this material is key to the durability of our final products. We\u2019re working hard to identify and incorporate recycled content into the material we use to produce glass parts. Following the precedent set in iPhone 12, the iPhone 13 continues to use recycled glass in multiple components. And by incorporating quality scrap in our applications, we also help keep glass at its highest-purity use for future recovery. As we collect and reuse scrap in new parts, we\u2019re also more efficient in how we use the material. |\n|                   | Availability and access         |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|                   | Scale                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Gold              | Regulatory barriers             | For the first time on any Apple product, iPhone 13 used 100 percent certified recycled gold, found in the plating of the main logic board and the wire in the front camera and the rear cameras. To obtain this from entirely recycled sources required pioneering industry-leading levels of traceability to build a gold supply chain of exclusively recycled content. Gold as a material is often recovered and recycled; as a result, gold from primary and secondary sources is often commingled. So it was only through this level of traceability that we could certify that our material came from 100 percent recycled sources. We\u2019ve shown this is possible with iPhone 13 and are working to scale our use to other products as well. |\n|                   | Transparency                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Lithium           | Technical properties            | We\u2019re working to shift toward recycled materials recovered from batteries as these options become more viable and economical. While we\u2019ve been able to identify sources of recycled content, we\u2019re now working to test the performance of the recycled material to see if it can meet our requirements \u2014 both at the material level and in its application in batteries. This rigorous evaluation process takes time, but it\u2019s key to maintaining the performance of our products as we transition to recycled content over the long term. And we\u2019re forging relationships with partners and recyclers capable of bringing more of this material into the market. |\n|                   | Availability and access         |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|                   | Scale                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Paper             | For more information on our progress on paper, see our feature on packaging.                                                                                                                                  |\n| Plastics          | Technical properties            | We use a broad range of plastics in our products \u2014 found in hundreds of unique components, from speakers to keycaps. Each plastic material has different performance requirements that we must maintain as we switch to recycled or renewable sources. We are diligently pursuing this effort. In fiscal year 2021 alone, we introduced more than 100 parts with an average of 45 percent recycled plastic. These include the antenna lines on iPhone 13, which use \u201cupcycled\u201d plastic from bottles that have been chemically transformed into a stronger, higher-performance material. And 15 additional components used plastics made with bio-based content rather than fossil fuels, an important step as we continue to pursue certified renewable plastic sources. |\n|                   | Availability and access         |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|                   | Scale                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Rare earth elements| Regulatory barriers             | We\u2019re featuring greater percentages of recycled rare earth element content across our latest devices: 98 percent in iPhone 13, 99 percent in Apple Watch Series 7, 99 percent in the 24-inch iMac, and 100 percent in AirPods (3rd generation). More than 45 percent of the total rare earth elements used in the fiscal year came from certified recycled sources, a significant increase since we introduced recycled rare earth elements for the first time in 2019. |\n|                   | Availability and access         |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|                   | Scale                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Material | Key challenges | Progress |\n|----------|----------------|----------|\n| Steel    | Regulatory barriers, Technical properties | Since steel is a highly recycled material, we focus on keeping it in the highest-quality form possible, working to make sure high-purity steel gets recovered from our manufacturing scrap and our products at end-of-life. We are working with our supply chain partners on opportunities to expand the use of recycled content further into components of our products and to pursue third-party certifications. |\n| Tantalum | Regulatory barriers, Availability and access, Supply chains | We continue to address the challenge of sourcing 100 percent recycled content at the quality we need for use in capacitors. We\u2019re actively investigating recovery approaches from end-of-life electronics to develop further use of this recycled material. Based on material recovery rates, there may already be some recycled tantalum within our products. However, to reach our goal, we have to move beyond existing tantalum supply chains that mix primary and secondary content. This requires starting from the beginning, by identifying new sources of quality tantalum scrap and building traceable supply chains around exclusively recycled material so that we can verify its use in high quantities in our products. |\n| Tin      | Regulatory barriers, Scale | In fiscal year 2021, 30 percent of our tin came from certified recycled sources as we continued to scale our use. All new iPhone, iPad, AirPods, and Mac devices released in the fiscal year featured 100 percent recycled tin in the solder of the main logic board. We\u2019re also continuing to use recycled tin in our accessories, including our power adapters, the Wireless Charging Case for AirPods Pro, and Apple Pencil. And we continue to expand to new components as well, including recycled tin in the solder of the True Tone flash of iPad Pro and the battery management unit of iPhone 13. As we scale use across even more components, we seek to engage an exponentially increasing number of suppliers in this effort. |\n| Tungsten | Regulatory barriers, Technical properties | More than 90 percent of the tungsten used in fiscal year 2021 came from recycled sources, a significant milestone from prior years. Both Apple Watch Series 7 and iPhone 13 feature 99 percent recycled tungsten across the entire device. And with the help of our disassembly robots, Daisy and Dave, the tungsten from our Taptic Engine can be recovered and recycled. |\n| Zinc     | Technical properties, Supply chains | We continue to work to identify high-quality sources of recycled zinc. This is a challenge as the material is prone to accumulate impurities during the recycling process. Each source we identify we rigorously test to ensure that recycled materials meet our high performance standards. In March 2022, we introduced 100 percent recycled zinc for the first time in Apple Studio Display and Mac Studio, which use 100 percent recycled zinc in the brass prongs of the power cord plug and AC inlet. |\nInnovating packaging to reduce our footprint\n\nWe\u2019ve made significant progress toward eliminating all plastics from our packaging by 2025.\n\nThis past year, plastics accounted for only 4 percent of our packaging. Since 2015, we\u2019ve dedicated our efforts to replacing large plastic trays, wraps, and foam cushioning with fiber alternatives that have higher recovery rates and reduced environmental footprints. And we remain focused on completing this work. We\u2019ve directed our energies toward eliminating the remaining plastic in our packaging.\n\nThis year we released iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro \u2014 the first iPhone to be shipped without any plastic packaging components. To achieve this, we eliminated the polypropylene wrap around each box. We\u2019ve used this plastic wrap since the launch of iPhone 8 to protect the box from damage and tampering. We wanted to retain the benefits of plastic wrap without the environmental impact, while creating a more accessible unboxing experience. Our packaging team took on the challenge to achieve both. The team conducted user studies, assessed the weight and repulpability of materials, and prototyped designs. For this year\u2019s iPhone release, they developed an alternative that relies on two small fiber-based pull-tabs. This replacement of traditional plastic wrap not only provides a tamper seal, it allows us to avoid an estimated 600 metric tons of plastic.\n\nWe also made significant improvements on iMac this year. Our team worked on an alternative to the plastic foam we used to protect each iMac during shipping. Previously, we\u2019d designed molded fiber parts to replace foam components in the iMac Pro box. We set out to create a similar alternative to packing foam \u2014 one that absorbs energy while maintaining resilience and structure. Our solution was to develop a fiber-based corrugated spring. Using origami-inspired techniques, our team created a design that could perform as well as traditional foam, yet be more easily recycled. This design relied on corrugated cardboard, a widely used packaging material, allowing us to work with existing suppliers. Our fiber-based corrugated spring is the first such use of this material to replace traditional packing foam. Through this innovation, we avoided more than 400 metric tons of plastic.\n\nFor the 24-inch iMac, using corrugated fiber rather than foam for shock absorption allowed us to reduce plastic by 72 percent.\nThese innovations are part of our broader strategy. We\u2019re both seeking to reduce waste by eliminating plastic and focusing on recycled and renewable materials in our packaging. Apple\u2019s packaging design guidelines also factor in packaging recyclability, requiring the use of fiber-based materials that can break back down to pulp as part of mixed paper recycling streams \u2014 alongside materials like cereal boxes. These guidelines are supported by third-party assessments from firms including Western Michigan University\u2019s Paper Pilot Plant and the U.S. Forest Service\u2019s Forest Products Laboratory, and we continue to monitor evolving international packaging standards. In fiscal year 2021, all newly released iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and MacBook devices shipped in packaging that was more than 90 percent fiber-based. And we continue to supply all of the wood fiber in our packaging from recycled or responsible sources. This year, we\u2019ve turned our efforts toward developing alternatives to foams, films, and wraps.\n\nWe\u2019re doing so to ensure that we have well-designed, lower-impact alternatives ready for use. We also advocate for action to reduce plastics, promote the efficient use of low-impact materials, and encourage requirements that consider the entire packaging life cycle.\n\nThese efforts include our commitment to using responsibly sourced wood fiber while, at the same time, contributing to the global supply of these responsible materials. Through partnerships with The Conservation Fund and World Wildlife Fund, we\u2019ve protected and improved more than 1 million acres of working forests in the U.S. and China. In fiscal year 2021, these forests generated enough responsibly sourced fiber to balance all the fiber used in our packaging.\n\nPackaging fiber and plastic footprint* (metric tons)\n\nOur goal is to eliminate all plastics from our packaging by 2025. In fiscal year 2021, only 4 percent of our packaging footprint was from plastic. And 63 percent came from recycled fiber. Since 2017, 100 percent of the virgin wood fiber used in our packaging has come from responsible sources.**\n\n* These data include the materials used in our packaging. Fiber used at our corporate facilities represents less than 1 percent of our overall fiber use. Non-fiber, non-plastic materials excluded from these totals. Beginning in 2021, we excluded adhesives from our boundary as these are non-fiber, non-plastic materials.\n\n** Responsible sourcing of fiber is defined in Apple\u2019s Sustainable Fiber Specification (PDF).\nProduct longevity\n\nWe believe long-lasting products are best for the environment. We also believe products that minimize the need for repair or replacement encourage our customers to come back to Apple. We design our products with this goal in mind.\n\nAnd for those customers who want the latest devices, we help them unlock the value of their current device through Apple Trade In or third-party trade-in platforms. This not only makes a subsequent purchase more affordable, it enables a new customer to experience Apple products and services and keeps a product in use as long as possible. With more customers able to access Apple products and services, this approach is not only good for the planet, it\u2019s good for business.\n\nA product designed for longevity will hold its value longer, benefiting our customers. iPhone, for example, retains value longer than any other smartphone. The iPhone depreciation rate is the lowest among the nine leading smartphone manufacturers, according to a study published last year by BankMyCell, a website that tracks trade-in and sale value of technology products. As of January 2022, iPhone 6s, introduced in 2015, still had monetary value for Trade In in the United States.\n\nThese results reflect our commitment to provide long-lasting devices, as well as our collective, ongoing effort to improve the longevity of our products. We\u2019ve approached this by designing durable hardware, developing access to safe and convenient repair services that meet our customers\u2019 needs, and providing software support for years so that more customers can unlock new features and functionality. With every generation of a product, we strive to deliver durability that minimizes the need for repairs through features like water resistance. Designing with repairability in mind is also an essential element of our commitment to long-lasting devices. We\u2019ve made increasing access to repair options a priority \u2014 through Apple Authorized Service Providers, the Independent Repair Provider program, and, announced in 2021, the upcoming Self Service Repair option. Our customers can access the type of repair service that they feel is best for them, should they need it. And by offering software updates, we aim to help more customers benefit from new features, whether their device is new or several generations older.\n\nWe build durability into our designs\n\nWe design our products to be used continuously, with minimal interruption for maintenance or repair. Designing and building durable hardware is core to delivering this customer experience.\n\nAcross our products, we develop innovative designs that are engineered to withstand the rigors of everyday use. We assess these designs against our strict durability standards through testing methods that mimic realistic conditions in which our customers use their products. Every aspect of our products is thoroughly assessed by engineers in our Reliability Testing Lab who measure the performance of materials, components, and fully assembled products. The durability standards established by us are based on in-depth user studies to understand how our customers use \u2014 and misuse \u2014 their products.\n\nThousands of units are tested during product development, and the results of each test inform the next round of design. We use a \u201crock tumbler\u201d test to assess the performance of the outer enclosure of iPad and iPhone against scrapes and scratches. This mimics the day-to-day abrasions of coins and keys that a device may experience in a purse or backpack. For Apple Watch, our engineers have created a weighted pendulum test to simulate impacts that a device may endure from an arm swinging into an object. These are in addition to our drop testing, which evaluates products falling from different heights and angles onto a range of surfaces to improve their resilience to an accidental drop. We continue to test recycled or renewable materials to the same performance standards as other materials \u2014 making sure our products stay as durable as ever, even as we explore new material sources.\nAnd just as we advance product features and capabilities with each new generation of a device, we also strive to improve durability. With iPhone 12, we introduced Ceramic Shield, a new front cover made entirely of a new material. Together with the new product design, it gave iPhone 12 four times better drop performance than the previous generation, and we carried that innovation over to iPhone 13. This advancement comes alongside other durability features, including industry-leading IP68 water resistance. We\u2019ve also made progress with Apple Watch Series 7, which has a water resistance rating of 50 meters (under ISO standard 22810:2010) and is also rated IP6X dust resistant. Each improvement is part of our effort to keep our products in use and out of the repair shop.\n\n### iPhone longevity journey\n\n- Features to enhance durability\n- Repairable at retail stores, Apple Authorized Service Providers, and central repair locations\n\n| iPhone (1st generation) | iPhone 4 | iPhone 7 | iPhone X | iPhone 13 |\n|-------------------------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|\n| SIM tray                | SIM tray | SIM tray | SIM tray | SIM tray  |\n| Battery                 | Battery  | Battery  | Battery  | Battery   |\n| Haptics                 | Haptics  | Haptics  | Haptics  | Haptics   |\n| Rear camera             | Rear camera | Rear camera | Rear camera | Rear camera |\n| Main logic board        | Main logic board | Main logic board | Main logic board | Main logic board |\n| Display                 | Display  | Display  | Display  | Display   |\n| Splash, water, and dust resistant: IP67* | Splash, water, and dust resistant: IP67* | Splash, water, and dust resistant: IP67* | Splash, water, and dust resistant: IP67* | Splash, water, and dust resistant: IP68* |\n| Sapphire crystal lens cover | Sapphire crystal lens cover | Sapphire crystal lens cover | Sapphire crystal lens cover | Sapphire crystal lens cover |\n| Surgical-grade stainless steel | Surgical-grade stainless steel | Surgical-grade stainless steel | Surgical-grade stainless steel | Surgical-grade stainless steel |\n| Ceramic Shield          |          |          |          | Ceramic Shield |\n\n* iPhone 7, iPhone X, and iPhone 13 models are splash, water, and dust resistant and were tested under controlled laboratory conditions. iPhone 7 and iPhone X have a rating of IP67 under IEC standard 60529 (maximum depth of 1 meter up to 30 minutes). iPhone 13 has a rating of IP68 under IEC standard 60529 (maximum depth of 6 meters up to 30 minutes). Splash, water, and dust resistance are not permanent conditions and resistance might decrease as a result of normal wear. Do not attempt to charge a wet iPhone; refer to the user guide for cleaning and drying instructions. Liquid damage not covered under warranty.\nWe\u2019re making repairs more convenient\n\nWe design our products to minimize the need for repair in the first place. If a repair is needed, we believe our customers should have convenient access to quality repair services to get their product back up and running as quickly as possible.\n\nOver the past three years, we\u2019ve nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to genuine Apple parts, tools, and training, offering more ways for consumers to get repairs. These repair options include Apple Store locations, Apple Authorized Service Providers (AASP), participating Independent Repair Providers, mail-in repair centers, or onsite service and, starting in 2022, Self Service Repair. Our repair network has grown to over 5000 AASP locations and over 3000 Independent Repair Providers around the world \u2014 in addition to our 500 Apple retail locations.\n\nFor the past three years, our Independent Repair Provider program has enabled independent repair businesses \u2014 large and small \u2014 access to genuine Apple parts, tools, diagnostics, and training. In 2021, this program expanded from the U.S., Europe, and Canada to more than 200 countries worldwide. We\u2019re also increasing coverage for onsite service options in select cities across the United States, providing greater convenience to our customers. We actively train and certify service personnel to service Apple products. Our global training system currently supports over a hundred thousand active technicians. This helps ensure that points of failure are correctly diagnosed, and services and repairs are performed successfully, preventing damage to the device and ensuring that the device works as it should.\n\nIn 2021, we announced Self Service Repair, a new program that offers Apple genuine parts and tools, as well as repair manuals, to customers.\n\nGlobal repair locations\n\n- Apple Authorized Service Providers, retail stores, and Independent Repair Providers\n- Self Service Repair\n\nNew **SELF SERVICE REPAIR** program announced in the U.S.\nWe also announced Self Service Repair coming later this year for iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 for customers who are comfortable completing their own repairs. The program will start in the U.S. and offers access to genuine Apple parts and tools, as well as a Repair Manual for the most common repairs on iPhone 12 and iPhone 13. And we\u2019ll be expanding the program to more products \u2014 starting with Mac computers featuring M1 chips \u2014 and additional countries throughout 2022. Following a repair, customers who send in their used parts for recycling will receive credit back from their purchase. Self Service Repair is intended for customers with the knowledge and experience to repair electronic devices. For most customers, visiting a professional repair provider with certified technicians who use genuine Apple parts is the safest way to repair a device.\n\n**We\u2019re designing products with repairability in mind**\n\nOur goal is to avoid the interruption a repair may cause for our customers, which is why we optimize designs for durability. But if a product requires a repair, it should be as convenient as possible. We continue to design our products with features that enhance repairability. For instance, iPhone has continued to improve repairability by increasing the number of repairable modules while also adding durability features like water resistance. The iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 designs, for example, allow for more repairs to be performed at more repair locations than ever before. Now these products\u2019 displays, batteries, cameras, speakers, and haptics, among other parts, can be repaired at central locations including retail stores and AASPs. And MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, 2018) and later models include a stretch-release adhesive, which facilitates battery replacement. We\u2019ve also expanded repair part availability in countries around the world for vintage products sold up to seven years previously. A new program for Mac notebooks makes battery repair available for up to 10 years after a product was last distributed. These efforts are just some of the ways we continue to make progress on the repairability of our products.\nWe keep our products current with software updates\n\nApple provides free software upgrades to improve our customers\u2019 experience and help our products last longer. Our customers can count on the latest software features and security updates to their existing devices for years. We continually improve the operating systems that power our products and engineer each software release to run seamlessly on all supported devices. This allows more customers to benefit from the latest software updates, whether their device is brand new or several generations older.\n\niOS 15, our most recent release, extends support back to iPhone 6s (2015). iPadOS 15 compatibility goes back to iPad Air 2 (2014) and macOS Monterey supports MacBook models from 2015 onward. The updates in each operating system make the latest capabilities \u2014 from FaceTime and SharePlay to Continuity features \u2014 available to a broad user base, keeping their devices up to date and extending their usability. These updates also help ensure that more customers have access to the newest security and privacy features available.\n\nOur updates remain popular with our customers. By January 2022, more than 70 percent of all iPhone devices introduced in the last four years had updated to iOS 15. And iPadOS 15 was being used on 57 percent of devices released in the last four years. These continually high rates of adoption make clear that our customers see value in software updates. And for a period of time, we also provided customers with the option to update iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 with new security features \u2014 helping those customers who wanted more time before updating to the newest operating system.\n\nWe extend the life of products and parts through refurbishment and reuse\n\nProducts that last longer make the best use of the resources that go into them. We can lower the impact each device has on the environment \u2014 including carbon intensity per year of life \u2014 by finding ways to refurbish and reuse these products. And by building our products to serve more than one owner and encouraging customers to exchange devices for an upgrade, we extend the life of our products.\n\nWe collect devices for refurbishing and reuse through several programs, including Apple Trade In, the iPhone Upgrade Program, AppleCare, and our corporate Hardware Reuse Program. In fiscal year 2021, we sent 12.2 million devices and accessories to new owners for reuse. Our Trade In program extends to 25 countries, providing customers with options for product end-of-life \u2014 to access the value of their current device if they want to upgrade to a newer model, or to recycle their devices for free.\n\nThe success of our trade-in programs and those of third parties is because of our customers. Their actions help realize the long-term value we\u2019ve designed and built into our products \u2014 whether through trading or passing down their devices, or by purchasing refurbished products. Each product that goes through this process marks progress toward reducing our overall environmental footprint.\n\nWe\u2019re also working on getting the most from the parts inside our devices. At the end of life of a product we can realize the potential of components through recovery and reuse, either as replacement parts or in new creative applications. We\u2019re also expanding the number of parts that can be recovered, refurbished to our high quality and performance standards, and reused as replacements. This enables us to reduce the need to create spare parts as we repair devices. And we continue to look for innovative opportunities to reuse accessories sent for recycling as well. For example, we send collected power cables and adapters that still function to our final assembly sites, where they power products used on production lines.\nProduct end-of-life\n\nEach stage in the life cycle of our products is significant, including end-of-life. When a product or part no longer functions as intended, it can still be a source of valuable materials for the next generation of products.\n\nBy effectively recovering these materials, we enable the circular supply chains that make the best use of finite resources. This requires collaboration \u2014 with our customers who trade in their used products and recyclers who recover materials from them. Through this approach, we\u2019re reducing the need to mine new materials and the amount of energy needed to manufacture new products, ultimately driving down emissions and conserving resources.\n\nWe\u2019re using partnerships and innovation to optimize how we recycle\n\nRecycling is at the center of our efforts to create circular supply chains. We strive to make it easier for our customers to recycle our products. In 99 percent of the countries where we sell products, we continue to provide and participate in product take-back and recycling collection programs. These include our retail locations, where our customers can trade in devices they are no longer using to be reused or recycled, as well as recycling programs offered by local operators. Customers also have access to even more recycling options through online platforms like Trade In. With the help of customer and employee participation across recycling programs, we directed more than 38,000 metric tons of e-waste to recycling globally in fiscal year 2021.\n\nWe have high standards for our recycling partners. We seek out and work with recyclers and refiners who are the best-in-class, who can deliver high recovery rates and meet our rigorous requirements. In fiscal year 2021, we conducted 75 recycler audits globally, for compliance on topics including labor and human rights, security, and EHS regulations. We also work closely with these recyclers to further encourage the use of best practices in their facilities. Each one of our recyclers in North America is either e-Stewards or R2 certified, the electronics industry\u2019s leading certifications.\n\nWe help our recyclers develop the capabilities and resources to effectively recycle each Apple product. This requires collaboration, training, and ongoing support. Our experts work onsite at the recycling locations with our recycling partners\u2019 staff to better understand their needs and the challenges they face. Last year, we introduced new Apple Recycler Guides to provide guidance for professional electronics recyclers on how to safely disassemble Apple products \u2014 and maximize recovery of resources. The guides are developed by our engineering teams, to optimize recovery and make sure that the processes can be completed using tools and procedures available to a wide range of professional recyclers. Each guide provides valuable insight on the steps for disassembly, as well as recommended downstream material recyclers for our disassembled parts. And we\u2019re always looking to innovation to support recyclers. This year we\u2019ll be piloting a simple-to-use augmented reality tool to better train our partners on disassembly and recovery. We\u2019re also working to develop a vision system for machines to better sort and organize scrap, enabling better material recovery.\n\nWith the support of recycling partners around the world, we directed more than 38,000 metric tons of e-waste to recycling globally in fiscal year 2021.\nWe\u2019re constantly developing new approaches to disassembly and recovery\n\nAt our Material Recovery Lab (MRL), also located in an R2-certified facility, we\u2019re working on developing better, more efficient means of disassembling products that maximize material recovery, while minimizing waste. The MRL\u2019s work assesses the recyclability of our products, helping to inform design decisions that support disassembly and recovery. And it engages with the educational community. Interns from universities across the U.S. joined our engineers in 2021, developing new approaches to the unique challenges of recycling. Interns have helped benchmark the performance of computer vision systems and modeled recycling processes to predict performance, among other projects. We\u2019ve also opened the MRL\u2019s internship to students earlier in their undergraduate years, to provide them with access and experience to help develop their careers.\n\nWe\u2019ve also continued to innovate on disassembly technologies. Our disassembly robot Daisy quickly and skillfully disassembles iPhone devices into discrete components to enable better material recovery and recycling. Last year, we expanded Daisy\u2019s disassembly capabilities from 15 to 23 models of iPhone, including all models between iPhone 5 to iPhone 12. All of this effort to disassemble iPhone devices creates meaningful results. From just one metric ton of iPhone main logic boards, flexes, and camera modules recovered by Daisy, our recycling partner was able to recover the same amount of gold and copper as more than 2000 metric tons of mined rock.18 And we hope that Daisy can inspire similar efforts. Last year, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued Apple five patents related to Daisy, which we\u2019re willing to license to researchers and other electronics manufacturers developing their own disassembly processes.19\n\nWe\u2019re also continuing to develop other tools. Dave, our robot that disassembles Taptic Engines, helps recover valuable rare earth magnets, tungsten, and steel. And Taz, our latest recycling machine, is designed to recycle modules containing rare earth magnets as an alternative to the conventional shredder many recyclers rely on. While rare earth magnets are typically lost in these conventional shredders, Taz is designed to keep these valuable materials intact to improve our overall recovery rate. We\u2019ve also worked on other manual and semi-automated tools, including 3D printed tools to improve the ergonomics and safety of battery recovery, as well as a custom-designed jig to disassemble AirPods charging cases.\n\nWe\u2019re designing for the next generation of recycling\n\nRecycling innovation requires a long-term approach. Our current technologies serve a vital role in recovering valuable materials \u2014 and we\u2019re committed to continuously improving how we do this. At the same time, new and emerging technologies represent some of the best opportunities to impact the future. Research and development in these areas have the potential for transformative changes. This is what drives our investment and support of initiatives that are poised to redefine disassembly and recovery.\n\nFor the past three years, we\u2019ve worked with Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Biorobotics Lab on new approaches and methods for recycling. This has included developing machine learning models to sort e-waste at scale, an innovation with the potential to enable recyclers to recognize valuable modules and devices to recover their resources within a diverse waste stream. We\u2019ve also worked with the lab on incorporating X-ray imaging with RGB imaging to improve the accuracy of disassembly and recovery of materials. And we\u2019re optimizing how our robots function, enabling a robot to \u201cfeel\u201d by using high-frequency force feedback and machine learning, so it can adjust behavior when contacting an object. This is a small step in a larger effort toward developing truly intelligent disassembly technology.\nOur position on resource recovery policy\n\nTo achieve truly circular products and supply chains requires innovative approaches \u2014 to technical obstacles and policy challenges.\n\nOver the last year, we reached new milestones in how we use recycled materials in our products, extend the life of our devices, and enhance recycling of our products. iPhone 13 made extensive use of certified recycled content, including rare earth elements, tungsten, aluminum, and for the first time, gold. Our new iPad devices incorporated a 100 percent recycled aluminum enclosure. The global expansion of our Independent Repair Provider program, and the announcement of our Self Service Repair program, will make repair options more accessible for those seeking to extend the life of their Apple products. And our disassembly robot Daisy expanded its capabilities to take apart an even greater range of iPhone devices, for better material recovery. Each of these is part of our ongoing efforts to build, support, and participate in circular supply chains.\n\nWe\u2019re also working to improve policy to scale product recovery and material recycling so global industries can meet key environmental goals. Part of this requires reframing the understanding of the product life cycle. Products at the end of their life should be viewed as a source of materials for new products \u2014 with significant environmental opportunities. For example, we\u2019re able to recover one metric ton of gold and copper from end-of-life iPhone components that would otherwise require mining more than 2000 metric tons of rock.20 This represents both an achievement for circular supply chains and significant carbon savings. Recycled aluminum, for example, can have 1/40th the carbon footprint of primary aluminum.21\n\nYet, existing policies don\u2019t see recovered materials as resources. They often view products and materials no longer serving their intended use as waste \u2014 and, in some cases, more stringently as hazardous waste. We fully support the intent of these policies to protect vulnerable communities from global waste streams. But some policies can also limit the ability to move recovered materials to best-in-class recyclers or refiners, which can unintentionally make mining the earth more cost-effective than reuse of materials. We believe there could be a new approach to regulations \u2014 that better protect communities and help the broader electronics industry realize the full potential of recovered material as a resource. This would make movement of some materials around the world to recyclers and refiners more transparent and efficient. It would also increase the recovery and reuse of materials, while strengthening environmental and community protections.\n\nTo make progress on resource recovery, we need a global paradigm shift on how materials are moved. One key first step would be for the U.S. to ratify the Basel Convention.22 The Convention serves as the global framework that governs how some waste can be moved around the world for recycling, recovery, and disposal in an environmentally responsible way. It provides critical protections against the movement of hazardous waste into countries that lack the resources to manage them properly. It has been ratified by 189 countries, meaning that those nations can move waste covered by the Convention among themselves under the agreement\u2019s requirements. The U.S. is one of a very small number of nations that is not a party to the Basel Convention. As a result, the movement of Basel-controlled wastes for recycling or resource recovery into or from the U.S. to nearly all other countries in the world is highly restricted, requiring specific trade agreements with that country. Not only is it harder for the U.S. to participate in the international movement of material for purposes of recycling, it is also limited in the ability to influence policy as the Convention evolves and to create more efficient and effective circular supply chains for electronics. But there is an opportunity for a new approach. By ratifying the Basel Convention, the U.S. could unlock the potential to influence policy and create more efficient and effective circular supply chains.\nWater\n\nEvery drop of water counts in the design and use of our products, services, and sites.\n\nIn many locations, freshwater resources have become increasingly scarce and vulnerable to the effects of climate change. We\u2019re committed to managing the resources we share with the communities where we and our suppliers operate. This means taking steps to reduce our freshwater withdrawals and return clean water to watersheds. Using this approach, we\u2019re helping address one significant aspect of the water challenge \u2014 availability. We aim to reserve freshwater use to applications where it\u2019s essential \u2014 like drinking water \u2014 and switch to lower-quality water for applications like irrigation and cooling. We\u2019re also working to maintain the quality of water we use and discharge to help make water available at a quality fit for its next use. Finally, water access matters to us. Broader communities and ecosystems within the watershed also need access to water resources. Our approach to water stewardship takes each of these three factors into consideration. And we look beyond the needs and activities happening within our facilities and those of our suppliers to the needs of the communities where we operate.\n\nContext matters in this approach. We use tools like the World Resources Institute (WRI) Water Risk Atlas to provide geographically specific water use and water-related risks that inform our local strategy. Areas with high water risk \u2014 where approximately 39 percent of our corporate water use occurs \u2014 are our priority, but our strategy also works to proactively address areas of medium risk. And we use assessments of water stress along with site-level water use to guide our supply chain efforts as well.\n\nWhat we know about our local water footprint informs how we prioritize and target our efforts. We measure and continually monitor usage at our facilities, and we survey our direct suppliers on the water impact of their sites as well. These efforts already exceed the industry standard, but we go even further. To add to the data collected from direct suppliers, we\u2019ve also invested in life cycle assessment tools to begin to estimate water use even further upstream in material supply chains. It\u2019s not common to account for these upstream uses within our industry. We believe this rigorous and holistic measurement of our supply chain\u2019s impact is essential to driving effective water management across the value chain.\n\nOur efforts to address the water footprint of our corporate sites and of our suppliers\u2019 sites focus on the following key efforts:\n\n- Using water efficiently.\n- Expanding the use of alternative water sources, including onsite reuse.\n- Discharging water responsibly.\n- Enhancing our water stewardship to keep watersheds healthy for all who rely on them.\nWe\u2019re improving efficiency across our operations\n\nMinimizing freshwater use remains a priority. We focus our efforts on high water risk regions, taking steps to reduce our freshwater usage. At each of our corporate and supplier sites, we rely on water for sanitation, climate control, maintaining green spaces, or manufacturing. Even as we promote more efficient uses, we\u2019re committed to doing more.\n\nWe\u2019re committed to improving efficiency, to decouple the amount of freshwater we use from the growth in our corporate facilities. In fiscal year 2021, our facilities used about 1.4 billion gallons of water. We saved 133 million gallons of freshwater this fiscal year due to efficiency projects implemented since 2017.25\n\nOur local efforts are driving this progress. At our data centers in Maiden, North Carolina, and Reno, Nevada, we piloted an innovative approach to water treatment. Using a plant-based treatment method for process cooling water, we\u2019re able to increase water efficiency, while avoiding chemical usage and reducing discharge. This method also reduces waste since the plant material is compostable. In addition, the majority of our data center sites have water management plans in place, further supporting the overall management of nearly 30 percent of Apple total corporate water use.\n\nOur supply chain accounts for 99 percent of our total water footprint based on our detailed water inventory. That\u2019s why we partner closely with our suppliers through our Clean Water Program. The more than 195 participating supplier sites increased their average reuse rate to 41 percent and saved our suppliers 12.3 billion gallons of freshwater in fiscal year 2021 \u2014 for a total of 50.3 billion gallons of water savings since the program\u2019s launch in 2013.26 These savings come from a range of initiatives such as reuse of reclaimed water, upgrades to water-efficient equipment, or countercurrent rinse methods.\n\nWater use at corporate facilities\n\nWe track our corporate water use for our data centers, retail stores, and corporate offices.\n\n- **Freshwater**\n  We define freshwater as drinking-water quality, the majority of which comes from municipal sources and less than 5 percent comes from groundwater.\n\n- **Recycled water**\n  We source recycled water as a key alternative to freshwater and use it primarily for irrigation, cooling systems, or toilet flushing. Our recycled water comes primarily from municipal treatment plants, with less than 5 percent from onsite treatment.\n\n- **Other alternative sources**\n  We also capture rainwater and recover condensation as another alternative water source for use onsite.\nWe\u2019re using alternatives to freshwater\n\nWe\u2019re addressing water availability by utilizing alternatives to freshwater, including recycled water, reclaimed water, rainwater, and condensate. We\u2019re also supporting water quality by matching different qualities of water to appropriate uses. When we increase our reliance on alternative water sources at each of our locations, we lessen our impact on freshwater demand within the local watershed.\n\nLast year, alternative water sources accounted for 10 percent of our total corporate water usage \u2014 primarily from recycled water sources. At Apple locations in Texas, North Carolina, Ireland, Taiwan, and Japan, we utilized rainwater capture systems to source 7 million gallons of water. We continue to introduce advanced water recovery systems. And in Santa Clara Valley and North Carolina we\u2019re expanding our condensate recovery.\n\nOur suppliers are also implementing innovations to use alternative sources of water. Several suppliers have begun to collect steam that condenses from boilers \u2014 a central piece of equipment at these supplier sites. Steam collection not only provides a new water source, but also reduces the frequency that boilers need to be cleaned of impurities. This yields both water and energy savings. Through initiatives like these, the suppliers within our Clean Water Program reused an average of 41 percent of wastewater in 2021.\n\nWe\u2019re managing the quality of water we discharge\n\nWhen we return water to the watershed, we want to ensure that others can use it. This requires taking active steps to manage the quality of the water we discharge. We\u2019ve made this a pillar of our water stewardship approach because it directly affects the availability of water to the communities with which we share this resource.\n\nActivities at Apple facilities \u2014 like offices, data centers, and retail stores \u2014 are largely low risk with regard to water discharge quality. Most wastewater is discharged to the sanitary sewer; for example, up to 54 percent of the water we use at our corporate locations is discharged back into the local water system rather than consumed. Where sites have an industrial wastewater discharge, we monitor our water quality and have policies to ensure that each site meets or exceeds local discharge requirements.\n\nWe require our suppliers to maintain the high standards for water discharge outlined in the Apple Supplier Code of Conduct. Through Apple\u2019s Clean Water Program, we help suppliers to minimize process water impacts and adopt best practices in wastewater treatment. For example, we advise that our suppliers avoid combining wastewater streams to simplify cleaning and filtration. This enables wastewater reuse and reduces reliance on freshwater resources. We support these efforts with training, offering guidance on advanced wastewater treatment methods and technologies to empower our suppliers to improve the quality of water they discharge so it\u2019s ready for its subsequent use. We are also piloting the use of acid recovery and filtration technologies to clean process water so it can be used again and again \u2014 enabling a high reuse rate for a critical manufacturing process. This technology extracts and cleans all chemicals out of water used in a final step in the aluminum casting process. The extracted materials are either reused or disposed of, while the water remains within the production cycle. This avoids discharge and ensures the continual reuse of water. The pilot ran successfully at a supplier site and will continue at an Apple facility to further prove the technology\u2019s application \u2014 new to our industry.\nWe\u2019re working to keep watersheds healthy\n\nWater is a shared natural resource, and managing local watersheds requires shared responsibility and collective effort. We\u2019re committed to understanding our impacts on the watersheds where we operate and engaging in action critical to ensuring their health. In Prineville, Oregon, we partnered with the city to bring an aquifer storage and recovery system online in May 2021. In fiscal year 2021, this system stored nearly 100 million gallons of water during winter months, reducing pressure on the local watershed during drier summer months.29\n\nPrineville was also the location of our first Apple-owned or operated site \u2014 and the first data center worldwide \u2014 to achieve certification under the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS). The Alliance is a global membership collaboration between public and private sector members and NGOs to promote a shared framework on the sustainable use of water. These certifications reflect each facility\u2019s efforts to consider impacts to local water basins to benefit local communities and ecosystems. And we\u2019re expanding our commitment to AWS by pursuing certification of our remaining owned and operated data centers.\n\nApple works with the Alliance for Water Stewardship and others to promote water stewardship that protects the health of water basins, including the Kunshan watershed in China.\nOur supplier facilities are also aligning to these best practices in water stewardship. As of the end of fiscal year 2021, 17 supplier facilities have received certification, of which 15 were Platinum status, the highest level of recognition by AWS. In 2021, we also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Suzhou Industrial Park Administrative Committee and TEDA Eco Center with the aim of Suzhou becoming the world\u2019s first industrial park to achieve AWS certification. Of the more than 1700 companies operating out of the 278-square-kilometer industrial park, 11 are Apple suppliers. In January 2022, after months of collaborative engagement with suppliers and partners, the industrial park officially obtained the AWS Gold Level certification. With this milestone, Suzhou Industrial Park achieved the objective of becoming the first industrial park in the world to obtain AWS certification.\n\nAs we pursue water stewardship within our own supply chain, we are also working to catalyze broader industry change through collaborations with groups, including AWS and the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA). In 2021, we supported the translation of the AWS standard into Japanese and developed guidelines on best practices for Apple suppliers.\n\nAnd we continued our work with AWS and RBA on the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) water stewardship working group. We\u2019re aiming to expand the dialogue on water use to industries that have historically been less involved in water issues, while providing opportunities to share knowledge and best practices.\n\nWe\u2019ve also worked with NGOs like the Alliance for Water Stewardship, The Nature Conservancy (Qiandao Lake Waterfund Project), and Conservation International to foster collaboration at the basin level, particularly in high-risk areas. For the past three years, in an effort to raise broader awareness of water challenges and opportunities in local communities in China, Apple has organized a series of hands-on learning experiences for a diverse group of stakeholders we call Water Champions. To have a real effect on water resources requires collaboration, which is why we\u2019ve engaged broadly to work with others.\nZero waste\n\nSending materials to landfill makes poor use of the world\u2019s resources, while also contributing to global emissions. And the most vulnerable communities around the world are disproportionately exposed to the negative consequences of waste disposal. This is why we\u2019ve made waste-free operations a priority.\n\nWe\u2019re working to send nothing to landfill from our offices, retail locations, data centers, and construction sites. This effort also extends to our suppliers. We\u2019re also taking steps to eliminate waste generated during manufacturing, engaging with local specialty recyclers and composters to redirect materials from landfills. This work requires innovative approaches and local solutions, to preserve the resources we rely on and to build our processes around this objective. If we can stop waste at the source, we create meaningful progress \u2014 protecting each community where we and our suppliers operate.\n\nWe\u2019re working on new approaches to waste at our corporate facilities\n\nAcross our corporate operations, we\u2019re reducing the amount of waste we generate and directing more toward recycling programs. We launched the Zero Waste Program in 2018 with a focus on our major U.S. campuses and global retail stores. Since then, our operations have grown both in the U.S. and globally. But our objective remains the same: to send zero waste to landfill.\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, recycling and composting efforts allowed us to achieve a waste diversion rate of 68 percent, limiting landfill waste from our global operations to about 15,000 metric tons.30 Our overall waste generated also remained low in part due to COVID-related temporary closure of facilities. We\u2019re continuing to make strategic progress across our sites. In 2015, our campus in Cork, Ireland, became the first Apple facility to receive UL\u2019s Zero Waste to Landfill certification. Last year, our Mesa, Arizona, data center became the second Apple facility to receive TRUE certification, following the Prineville data center in 2020.31 TRUE recognizes that more than 90 percent of waste from a facility is sent to recycling or compost, or is redirected for reuse. We upgraded our infrastructure to allow for better waste separation, and by switching to reusable alternatives from single-use materials. Each certification also involved coordinating with local composters, as well as identifying and partnering with local plastics recyclers that could handle specific materials, including plastic wraps and foams. These providers are local businesses that provide broader solutions than municipal waste disposal programs. And our work with them is an opportunity to support the local economies around recycling and composting.\n\nAs our company continues to grow and change, we\u2019ve made construction and demolition waste a priority. This year we were able to achieve a waste diversion rate of 85 percent, approximately 13,000 metric tons of construction and demolition material, through recycling and source separation efforts. At our corporate office in New York City, we were able to recycle over 170 metric tons of drywall from landfill by partnering with a local specialty recycler. At several locations in Santa Clara Valley, California, we piloted an effort to separate waste onsite, which allowed us to unlock opportunities to generate revenue from recyclers seeking specific types of waste, like copper cables. These recycling efforts allowed us to achieve an impressive 100 percent waste diversion rate across sites \u2014 an effort we aim to scale. For preservation projects at our retail locations in the U.S. and Canada, we require vendors to recycle, compost, or reuse at least 75 percent of construction and demolition waste \u2014 and ask them to disclose materials that were landfilled.\nAnd we\u2019re focused on reducing waste. This starts with identifying key sources of waste \u2014 like packaging materials or commonly used equipment. We\u2019re collaborating with our suppliers to move toward bulk packaging, or packaging made with materials that are recyclable or reusable. We are also switching to reusable air filters across our data center sites \u2014 a commonly used and replaced piece of equipment without a recycling solution. We partnered with a car filter manufacturer to develop a new reusable air filter that fits the specific performance requirements of our data center equipment. And these filters are also available to other companies. As we build out and maintain our data centers, we will use only reusable filters in the future.\n\nFor the waste we can\u2019t avoid, we\u2019re taking steps to keep it out of landfills. The first step is to ensure that items end up sorted correctly. This requires clear messaging and the availability of containers to redirect waste. We continue to roll out consolidated bins for recycling, composting, and landfill, and improved signage to reduce contamination and increase recycling rates. The majority of our corporate sites worldwide recycle paper, plastic, aluminum, and cardboard materials. And more than 450 of our offices and retail stores globally participate in composting as well.\n\nWe\u2019ve continued our focus on end-of-life options for personal protective equipment for the COVID-19 pandemic, including a waste-to-energy solution for face masks and gloves used in our offices in the Santa Clara Valley and at more than 250 retail locations in the United States. The health of employees, customers, and communities remains our priority; we\u2019re working to align the needs to operate safely with our zero waste objectives.\n\nWe also maintain our commitment to the safe and responsible management of hazardous waste, both onsite and offsite. The Treatment, Storage, and Disposal facilities (TSDFs) we utilize are audited to ensure that the waste is treated, recycled, or incinerated within the governing safety standards for health and the environment. Any facility that doesn\u2019t meet our requirements is replaced by another approved waste facility.\n\nWe\u2019re developing zero waste manufacturing with our suppliers\n\nWe\u2019re committed to leaving no waste behind in the communities where we build our products. To achieve this, we\u2019ve partnered with our suppliers, recyclers, and waste solution providers to eliminate waste from our manufacturing processes. Since we launched the Zero Waste Program for our manufacturing partners in 2015, we\u2019ve achieved considerable progress. At the close of fiscal year 2021, more than 100 facilities had been zero waste verified \u2014 nearly half of the supplier facilities that are part of our Zero Waste Program.\n\nAll participating facilities across 12 countries can access resources including guidance on how to reduce waste and then reuse, recycle, or compost the waste they do create. Suppliers can also access tools to improve waste management, and in some cases, onsite support. And we\u2019re seeing results: in fiscal year 2021, suppliers redirected 491,000 metric tons of waste from landfills, bringing the total to over 2 million metric tons since the program\u2019s inception \u2014 the equivalent of eliminating more than 2.5 million square meters of landfill space.\n\nWe\u2019ve been successful at achieving this goal at our final assembly supplier sites. For the second year in a row, 100 percent of established final assembly sites including iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, Apple TV, and Beats maintained zero waste to landfill operations in fiscal year 2021.\n\nThe next challenge is a level deeper into the sub-assembly module suppliers who assemble individual components that make up Apple products. The waste stream at this level is often more complex than final assembly sites, but we\u2019re making progress. We started with Apple Watch Series 7: By the end of the fiscal year, all established final assembly sites and all key module sub-assembly sites achieved zero waste \u2014 including the sites assembling the display, battery, housing, band, and packaging. Eliminating landfill waste across these sites marks both a significant effort and achievement, helping keep more than 35,000 metric tons of waste out of landfills.\nTo do this we\u2019ve partnered with our suppliers and local businesses to create new recycling options and develop opportunities for materials reuse. Recycling and reuse not only provides environmental benefits, but also can help our suppliers increase material efficiency and reduce the costs associated with material waste. At final assembly supplier sites, more of our suppliers use the recyclable and reusable alternatives we helped develop for key sources of waste \u2014 in particular, our Recyclable Protective Films (RPFs) that protect products during manufacturing, and the reusable trays used to deliver modules safely through assembly sites. In 2021, iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro were assembled using only RPFs.\n\nAccess to recycling and reuse varies from region to region, and some of our suppliers have limited access to recycling infrastructure. This was the case for our final assembly supplier site in Vietnam. To help this supplier become the first zero waste certified site in the country, we saw an opportunity to introduce a successful tray reuse program currently used by our suppliers in China. Trays play an essential role in our manufacturing process, carrying modules suppliers build to the final assembly site. We helped the third-party tray recycler expand their business from China to Vietnam, so they could collect, clean, and return plastic trays back to our supplier for reuse. Tray reuse across supplier sites reduced use of virgin plastic for component trays by 5000 metric tons in fiscal year 2021.\n\nYet, challenges remain for many suppliers \u2014 whether it\u2019s a lack of access to recycling technologies, the absence of local infrastructure, or the lower value of recyclable material that impacts the economics of recycling. To address these challenges together, and across our supply chain, we\u2019ve designed a \u201cWaste to Resource\u201d database to provide access to the existing available technologies and local recyclers that we collected from the suppliers we work with. To date, we have compiled information on more than 700 recycling resources across more than 170 cities in China. As more of our supplier locations achieve their zero waste goals, they will continue to share valuable resources through the database. In the future, we plan to make this information public for the benefit of the entire electronics industry.\n\nThis is a collaborative effort between Apple, suppliers, and recycling vendors. We will continue to work with more module suppliers to continue this momentum, to share best practices, to continue to innovate on reducing waste, and to help our suppliers match with more capable recycling technologies \u2014 as we work to eliminate the waste generated while we manufacture our products.\n\nIn 2021, Apple and UL co-developed the first-ever supply chain zero waste management system assurance program, which allows for third-party zero waste verification at a systems level rather than site level. The new assurance procedure significantly accelerates the verification process and establishes a new model that companies across industries can employ to verify zero waste programs at scale.\nDesigning buildings with the environment in mind\n\nWhen we build a new store or facility, we set out to create a space that reflects our values \u2014 from creativity and innovation to respect for the environment. This approach applies to all of our sites, including offices, retail locations, and data centers.\n\nWe align our design and construction criteria to industry-recognized best practices for green buildings, promoting water conservation, energy efficiency, and responsible material sourcing. Currently, 92 of our sites are LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environment Design) or BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) certified. That number grows each year as we develop more than 16 million square feet of green building space globally.\n\nFor our retail stores, we set out to have a minimal environmental impact. To that end, we\u2019ve prioritized locations that make use of existing construction. This provides an opportunity to build a space that meets our needs while limiting materials and resources that may otherwise be used in new construction. We\u2019ve focused on historical sites that can be reimagined to revitalize locations and the surrounding communities. Last year, we opened Apple Tower Theatre, a retail location, which housed the first motion picture theater in Los Angeles wired for film and sound when it opened in 1927. The restoration brought back to life a site that had lain empty and unused since 1987, creating an entirely new destination in downtown Los Angeles. Last May, in Rome, Italy, we opened Apple Via del Corso, the newest retail location nestled in one of city\u2019s most vibrant areas. The store preserves the grand Palazzo Marignoli, paying homage to Rome\u2019s rich history of art and culture, and making it one of Apple\u2019s most significant restoration projects. These restorations contribute to maintaining the heritage of communities where we open locations, without the resources and carbon intensity that goes with new construction.\nIn Istanbul, we opened Apple Ba\u011fdat Caddesi \u2014 our third retail location in Turkey \u2014 which marked significant environmental milestones in construction and design. During the store build-out, the project redirected 75 percent of construction and demolition materials from landfill. The location\u2019s glass facade and skylight contribute to an energy savings of 22 percent, serving dual purposes of utilizing daylight to illuminate the space while connecting the site to the exterior environment. An on-site rainwater collection system, which treats and recycles water for toilet flushing and landscaping, will reduce water consumption by 45 percent off of the baseline. We\u2019ve also been able to switch to a refrigerant with lower Global Warming Potential (GWP) than the baseline standard for LEED.\n\nThese efforts extend to our corporate offices and data centers. Our global footprint requires that we adapt to the needs of different locations and climates, while pursuing our overall objectives. This year, two new data centers in China \u2014 in Gu\u2019ian and Wulanchabu \u2014 received LEED Gold certification. These certifications recognized several achievements, such as up to 14 percent energy savings from features such as high-efficiency cooling systems, and about 40 percent reduction in indoor water use through high-efficiency fixtures. Both data centers make use of harvested rainwater for irrigation, further reducing water demand.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to have an impact on how we manage our spaces. We\u2019re evolving our approach to the new use patterns and capacity levels, actively adjusting our use of lighting and HVAC systems. For those who have already returned to our facilities, we\u2019re constantly monitoring occupancy to determine what additional ventilation and air filtration are needed to protect our employees.\n\nOur locations need to coexist with their environments while meeting our standards for human-centric design. To achieve this balance is a constant challenge \u2014 one that inspires creative solutions and novel approaches to urgent needs.\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nMercury\nPVC\nBeryllium\nBFR\nThe well-being of our employees, customers, people in our supply chain, and the planet is a priority for Apple, which is why we\u2019re committed to using safer materials to create safer products. This commitment requires diligent work \u2014 to build a comprehensive picture of chemicals across our supply chain, to insist on rigorous chemical management processes, to promote adoption of safer chemical alternatives, and to innovate through design smarter approaches to making our products. Using safer chemistry in our products also enables recycling and material recovery, so that our products can be the raw materials for the next generation.\n\n**Drive** comprehensive reporting of chemicals used in our supply chain to make our products\n\n- 1000+ manufacturing partner facilities shared how chemicals are used and safely managed\n- 1000+ parts and material suppliers have been onboarded into Apple\u2019s Full Material Disclosure program\n- 45K+ materials included in our comprehensive material library\n\n**Avoid** exposure to chemicals that could be harmful to human health or the environment\n\n- Safer Choice Partner of the Year award from the EPA for the second consecutive year\n\n**Integrate** smarter chemistry innovation into the way we design and build our products\n\n- 100% of our final assembly supplier sites have used only safer alternative cleaners and degreasers since 2018\n- 1000 new materials evaluated for biocompatibility in fiscal year 2021\n- Founding signatory of CEPN\u2019s Toward Zero Exposure program to help eliminate electronics workers\u2019 exposure to hazardous chemicals\n\n- A+ rating received from the Mind the Store campaign\n- Ranked #1 of 50 retailers on the Mind the Store Retailer Report Card\nOur approach\n\nWe are dedicated to creating circular supply chains around our products. We start by sourcing recycled and renewable materials. Yet we also want the materials in our products to be recycled and used again. This goal is possible only if we deeply consider the chemicals we use. Through smarter chemistry, we identify chemicals that best serve all of our efforts, including safety, performance, and environmental impact. This process not only facilitates our efforts to create circular supply chains for our products, it also seeks to protect global communities impacted by waste. And our efforts to remove potentially harmful chemicals help create a safe and healthy workplace for the people in our supply chain.\n\nThese efforts also focus on limiting potentially harmful chemicals in the materials used to manufacture our products \u2014 and pushing our industry to follow suit. We\u2019ve made considerable progress in accounting for the materials we use, both in our products and our manufacturing processes. This has allowed us to better protect the people who design, make, use, and recycle our devices \u2014 as we take steps to protect the environment. We\u2019re doing this through close engagement with others, including leading members of the scientific community, NGOs, and industry organizations. This work extends beyond our products, as we push for a global transition to materials that are safer to use and reuse.\n\nWe\u2019re proactive in promoting the use of safer materials and chemicals, establishing safety requirements that, in many cases, exceed local industry standards. And we empower our suppliers to not only meet these requirements, but also to find alternatives that are safer, are better for the environment, and deliver the performance we need. We\u2019ve built an infrastructure to do this work, including the rigorous requirements defined in our Regulated Substances Specification (RSS) and the deep supply chain engagement through our Full Material Disclosure (FMD) and Chemical Safety Disclosure (CSD) programs. We also share what we\u2019ve learned in the process of creating these systems with others in the industry \u2014 and push for transformational change.\n\nThis work requires leadership. We\u2019re committed to advocating for safer and more sustainable materials made with smarter chemistry \u2014 and working with our suppliers and material manufacturers to create alternatives that can help move our industry forward.\n\nThe pillars of our smarter chemistry strategy:\n\nMapping and engagement\nEngage our supply chain partners to comprehensively identify the chemicals in the materials used to make our products, allowing us to drive change that goes beyond what is required for regulatory compliance.\n\nAssessment and management\nAssess the potential human health and environmental risks of chemicals to evaluate compliance with our requirements and inform product design.\n\nInnovation\nDrive the development and use of innovative materials that enable the creation of groundbreaking products and also support industry-wide change.\nMapping and engagement\n\nOur commitment to creating quality products also encompasses their health and environmental impacts. That means understanding the materials and the chemistries that go into them. This requires collaboration \u2014 to develop a clear picture of the chemicals in the materials used to make our products and make improvements.\n\nWe\u2019re doing this in a few ways. First, our Full Material Disclosure (FMD) program maps the chemicals used in our products. Then we look at how our products are manufactured. Our Chemical Safety Disclosure (CSD) program engages with supply chain partners to get up-to-date information on which materials are in use. This information includes the volume of materials being consumed, and how they\u2019re being applied, stored, and handled \u2014 as well as the steps being taken to protect their employees.\n\nOur goal is to identify material chemistries that meet our criteria on performance, environmental impact, and safety. That requires a holistic view of the impacts of material chemistries at each phase in a product\u2019s life, from design and manufacturing, to the customer experience, through recycling and material recovery. With early engagement and effective data collection, we\u2019re best able to achieve these goals.\nAnd we\u2019re leading in these efforts by doing the work required to understand the detailed chemical composition of the materials used to make our products and of the chemicals used during manufacturing. This effort requires working closely with our supply chain partners to understand the materials they use. And the information we gather is necessary to make the right decisions when it comes to potential toxicological risks. The way we effectively collaborate with our partners can help others in our industry take their own steps toward eliminating potentially harmful chemicals in their products and manufacturing processes. With progress across our industry, we can build circular economies at scale.\n\nWe\u2019re comprehensively identifying the materials in our products\n\nOur process begins with gathering detailed and comprehensive information to inform our decision-making. Since it launched five years ago, the Full Material Disclosure (FMD) program aims to catalog and map each of the chemicals in the materials used in our products. Material manufacturers play a critical role in this program. They provide detailed reporting on material compositions from deep in our supply chain. This material chemistry data is proprietary. But once this data is shared through our innovative and secure data collection system, Apple has the information to make informed choices about the materials we use. Better choices based on better data are fundamental to delivering safer products.\n\nWe require each of our suppliers to participate in the program, collectively sharing information on thousands of materials used to manufacture our products. We\u2019ve also taken steps to make this process easier. Our advanced collection system provides suppliers with access to a library of over 45,000 materials, including detailed information that we have researched and validated. This materials library serves as a reference for our suppliers to help them better identify and describe the materials they use in our products. If the supplier is using a material not yet listed in our library, we work with them and the material manufacturer to authenticate the new material.\n\nThrough the FMD program, we\u2019re creating a detailed inventory of the materials used to make our products. For iPhone, iPad, and Mac products released in fiscal year 2021, we collected detailed chemical information on 89 percent of each product by mass, on average. For the 24-inch iMac (2021), we collected information on more than 92 percent of the product by mass. Our efforts across product lines include tens of thousands of parts and assemblies. We also prioritize the collection of information on those materials that are key for biocompatibility. We continue to collect detailed chemical information for all materials that come under prolonged skin contact and require qualification from our biocompatibility team.\n\nThe creation of our FMD program has been an innovative approach to a challenge faced across our industry. Identifying opportunities to reduce toxicological risk \u2014 and potentially develop new chemistries \u2014 requires deep knowledge. The comprehensive materials library provides an important foundation for this approach. It helps inform decisions across our product life cycle. We make assessments of the materials we specify, how we choose to manufacture our products, and eventually, how we recycle them. And we continue to innovate. We\u2019re using machine learning to digitize data from chemical tests so this information can be more easily assessed. We\u2019re also advocating for an industry standard to help encourage the digital exchange of this important information. Through these efforts, we can improve not only the safety of our products, but that of the broader electronics industry.\nWe\u2019re also creating an inventory of chemicals used in manufacturing\n\nThe health and safety of the people in our supply chain are our priority. The Apple Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Responsibility Standards outline our requirements for our suppliers in the areas of health and safety, labor and human rights, environment, ethics, and management systems. And we take into account how the process of selecting and managing chemicals used within our supply chain can impact the people working within our supply chain.\n\nThis begins with having the right information \u2014 not only the chemicals used by our suppliers as they make Apple products, but also how they are stored, handled, and consumed at each location. Our Chemical Safety Disclosure (CSD) program makes this possible. Suppliers provide this data as part of our program\u2019s rigorous disclosure process. Once suppliers provide a chemical inventory, we\u2019re able to help support compliance and identify opportunities to implement safer alternatives if needed.\n\nMore than 1000 supplier facilities have shared their chemical inventories as well as storage and safety protocols. Through this process, we\u2019ve identified more than 17,000 chemicals and applications. This extensive reporting includes suppliers representing the majority of Apple\u2019s direct spend, including over 95 percent of Apple-managed suppliers in China. All of these efforts contribute to a safer work environment for people across our supply chain.\n\nComprehensive chemical mapping\n\nMapping chemicals throughout product development leads to better, SAFER PRODUCTS\n\nUNDERSTANDING CHEMICAL INGREDIENTS leads to better materials for Apple products\n\nThrough our Full Material Disclosure (FMD) program, manufacturers share chemical ingredients used to make materials with Apple.\n\nWith FMD data, Apple evaluates the chemicals in materials against restrictions.\n\nData helps Apple suppliers MANAGE CHEMICALS when making Apple products\n\nInformation on how chemicals are used, how they\u2019re stored, and how employees are protected is shared with Apple by suppliers through our Chemical Safety Disclosure (CSD) program.\n\nCSD data informs and prioritizes supplier engagement, helping to ensure rigorous chemical management practices and adoption of safer alternatives.\n\nApple CUSTOMERS BENEFIT from use of products made with safer ingredients\n\nThe FMD and CSD programs help support creation of best-in-class products in a responsible manner for our customers.\nWe\u2019re working with suppliers to meet global requirements\n\nOur role goes further than setting the requirements for our suppliers to meet. We\u2019ve created systems that support ongoing efforts to track and assess the materials our suppliers use. Those frameworks not only help suppliers meet our requirements, but also help their operations follow global standards and regulations. The Full Material Disclosure (FMD) and Chemical Safety Disclosure (CSD) programs allow suppliers to gather and share information on chemistries they\u2019re using.\n\nWe support supplier engagement with these programs \u2014 and the Regulated Substances Specification (RSS) \u2014 through ongoing training. This continued engagement is central to our partnership and to our shared efforts to promote smarter chemistry in our products and processes. In 2021, our suppliers in China worked under the new regulations governing the use of materials containing Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). While we already had requirements in place for select applications of these materials, we provided additional support for suppliers with trainings on the new regulations that were attended by more than 2000 participants. We went even further to support compliance by testing and qualifying over 5000 low-VOC chemistries for use, helping our suppliers transition to these alternatives. And by deploying a new VOC specification worldwide, we\u2019re also helping drive adoption of low-VOC alternatives around the world.\nAssessment and management\n\nThe data we collect on chemicals and materials forms the foundation for key decisions that have an impact on our product designs, manufacturing processes, and approach to recycling and reuse. This data enables us to establish requirements for our suppliers, including those set in our Regulated Substances Specification (RSS) and the Restricted Chemicals for Prolonged Skin Contact Materials list.\n\nThese requirements provide clear guidelines on potentially harmful materials, including those that are restricted. Our assessment system helps to ensure that only materials that meet our stringent requirements are used in Apple products. Both the data we gather on chemicals and our rigorous assessments allow us to make informed decisions and manage chemicals, for the safety of those who use, make, and recycle our products. These decisions also help make the materials recovered from our products at end-of-life safer for reuse in new products, enabling circular supply chains.\n\nWe\u2019re setting \u2014 and maintaining \u2014 rigorous chemical safety requirements\n\nWe first published the Regulated Substances Specification (RSS) in 2002, setting requirements for the use of chemical substances or materials in our products, accessories, manufacturing processes, and packaging. This effort builds on our history of advancements in material safety \u2014 and it reflects our dedication to the collection of necessary data to make these choices.\n\nThe RSS continues to evolve alongside the latest research and standards. It draws from regulations, international standards, and voluntary requirements. The specification aligns with Apple\u2019s internal policies, incorporates the latest scientific research, and is regularly updated with new chemicals and scopes of restrictions. Many of our RSS restrictions exceed local regulatory requirements in order to protect human health and the environment. The RSS both designates restricted substances and requires reporting on additional substances that are not restricted.\n\nWe also leverage the diverse experience and expertise of our Green Chemistry Advisory Board members, who share feedback on key initiatives, like potential RSS updates. This independent group of leading researchers and academics helps to ensure that we\u2019re leading the way to protect our customers and those who make or recycle our products.\n\nWe pay special attention to the materials that will be in prolonged skin contact, to which we apply rigorous controls defined in our Restricted Chemicals for Prolonged Skin Contact Materials (RCPSCM) list. In particular, the restrictions focus on substances that are potential skin sensitizers, to minimize the potential for reactions commonly reported across wearable products, like jewelry. We derive these restrictions from leading standards, recommendations from toxicologists and dermatologists, international laws and directives, and Apple policies. We require that our suppliers vet each material that comes into prolonged contact with skin according to Apple\u2019s requirements, and further review compliance with these requirements. Our specifications are incorporated into contractual obligations for our suppliers, and each helps us maintain our stringent requirements.\n\nOur restrictions on potentially harmful chemicals are available online in the Apple Regulated Substances Specification (PDF) and in Apple\u2019s Restricted Chemicals for Prolonged Skin Contact Materials (PDF) list.\nWe\u2019re working on standards in the Environmental Testing Lab\n\nAt our Environmental Testing Lab, we evaluate the safety of our products and materials through chemical analyses. Our chemists test materials for safety and monitor compliance with our specifications. As we do this work, the Lab continues to grow in its mission and capacity. We\u2019re expanding our testing facilities with new technologies to conduct chemical analysis as we expand our Full Material Disclosure (FMD) and Chemical Safety Disclosure (CSD) programs. Our teams also review test reports from suppliers to evaluate substances against the RSS and Restricted Chemicals for Prolonged Skin Contact Materials list. In fiscal year 2021, we performed toxicological assessments on 1000 new materials to proactively evaluate and eliminate potentially harmful substances from our products.\n\nThe data we collect from our disclosure programs drives our assessments. We\u2019re able to generate comprehensive assessments, like GreenScreen\u00ae, a methodology we use to gauge the impact of chemicals on individual health and the environment based on 18 criteria. For new chemicals, we develop toxicological profiles, using both scientific literature and internal assessments. These profiles detail the features of each chemical, providing data that allows us to evaluate the safety of the use of a substance in a particular product. And, in 2021, we continued to expand the scope of biocompatibility testing beyond individual materials to include modules and whole products. This offers an even more comprehensive view of each product and details the impact that assembly has on overall safety. Within these products we perform toxicological evaluations of materials to help guide our evaluations of material safety. And what we share through the RSS and material specifications benefits our suppliers and those we collaborate with in the industry.\nWe\u2019re creating a list of safer cleaners\n\nAn area where we are making an immediate impact is the application of cleaners and degreasers. These substances account for some of the highest-use materials at final assembly sites \u2014 and their chemistries have been the focus of considerable attention from regulators and environmental health and safety organizations. We\u2019re investing in the due diligence required to identify preferred alternatives so that suppliers and others in the industry can also benefit.\n\nWe have decided to take a proactive approach that provides a list of cleaners and degreasers that are safer to use. We invested in the in-depth assessment and evaluation of these substances, incorporating leading guidance by GreenScreen\u00ae and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Safer Choice program. To date, we have evaluated and identified more than 90 cleaners.\n\nThese efforts have a direct impact and the potential to change how our industry operates. We\u2019re driving the use of safer alternatives for process chemicals in our supply chain by making it easier for suppliers to select preferred substitutions from the start. Since 2018, all our final assembly sites have used only safer alternative cleaners and degreasers. We\u2019re also looking across a wider group of materials, including adhesives, dyes, and other high-volume materials used in our supply chain, to begin driving the adoption of safer alternatives for more and more materials. In 2020, we were the first consumer electronics company to receive the EPA Safer Choice Partner of the Year Award. And in 2021, we received this recognition again for our work to scale the use of safer process chemicals, and protect those working in our supply chain.\n\nWe are also looking outside of our own supply chain to promote a broader transition to safer chemicals. See page 74 for more about how we\u2019re advocating for safer cleaners and degreasers across our industry.\nInnovation\n\nWe\u2019re continuing to develop our knowledge of material properties to make improvements in chemical safety and also in the performance and environmental impact of the materials. When we assess substances considering these three factors together, it helps drive innovations that don\u2019t require trade-offs.\n\nThe work we do in mapping, assessing, and managing the chemicals within our supply chain underpins our innovations. We rely on detailed information on the material properties, including toxicological data and environmental performance characteristics. We also look at how these materials are used at each point in the product life cycle, from design, to manufacturing, to end-of-life. This allows us to seek out and support the development of safer chemistries that have an impact on each phase \u2014 and contribute to continually improving the overall safety of our products and processes.\n\nWe\u2019re innovating the designs and processes used to make our products\n\nThe earlier we focus on materials during product development, the more options we have along the way to make improvements through innovation. The criteria we consider \u2014 safety, performance, and environmental impact \u2014 represent our holistic approach to smarter chemistry: designing to our customers\u2019 needs, so that our products exceed expectations, while being safer for use, reuse, and recycling.\n\nThe process of choosing both the substances we design into our products and those our suppliers use in manufacturing is foundational to achieving these goals. We rely on our comprehensive chemical profiles of each material to inform these choices. When a material is introduced into our supply chain, our CSD and FMD programs help provide information to assess a substance and its suitability. Our toxicological assessments look at each chemical within a material, with a particular focus on those that come into prolonged contact with skin. We also look at the conditions that the material is used within, to make recommendations that reflect the existing controls around a substance. As we select the materials to include in our products, we assess the process chemicals required with each design choice. We work proactively with our suppliers to help ensure that their employees are protected through proper storage, handling, and material application controls.\n\nAnd, finally, we consider what happens when our products reach their end-of-life. We work to protect those recycling our products and prevent potential releases into the environment during the recycling process. We monitor chemistries that are harmless in small quantities but become more concentrated through recycling cycles. We also look at how potentially harmful substances impact the recyclability of a material. This can lead to downcycling \u2014 use of the material in lower-quality applications \u2014 or could make the material unsafe for any use.\n\nThrough our efforts to share information across our supply chain, perform detailed chemical assessments, and partner with suppliers on chemical management, we unlock material science innovations that lead to better products. This not only protects those who make and use our products, but also enables the reuse of key materials. By keeping potentially harmful chemicals out of our supply chain at the outset, we make it possible for ourselves and others to recover materials for the next generation of products.\n\nWe also aim to support a broader industry transition toward safer chemistry through the creation of industry tools. For example, we joined the nonprofit ChemSec, and other industry partners in an effort to develop ChemCoach, a step-by-step approach to help companies advance chemical safety within their products and supply chains.\n\n\u201cChemicals safety is a global, shared responsibility, so ChemSec is thrilled to have Apple and other industry leaders join in sharing these practical tools for adopting sustainable practice. We hope this resource inspires more companies within the manufacturing industry to maximize the safety of their operations and products.\u201d\n\nAnne-Sofie B\u00e4ckar, Executive Director at ChemSec\nWe\u2019re creating new safer chemistries to move the industry forward\n\nSafer materials are a priority for our business \u2014 and we\u2019ve used our procurement process to encourage our suppliers to share this priority. Our strict requirements governing potentially harmful substances in our products and processes have helped create a market for safer alternatives. We\u2019re working with our suppliers to meet this demand, lending the expertise we\u2019ve developed to create safer chemistries where none exist. We\u2019ve also begun to phase out chemicals that don\u2019t meet our specifications. This work isn\u2019t limited to our company or our products. We\u2019re trying to catalyze change across our industry by investing in safer alternatives. By promoting the use of safer and cleaner chemistries now, we\u2019re supporting the circular supply chains of the future.\n\nWe\u2019ve collaborated with others on this goal, using our extensive research and analysis of materials to enable our suppliers to find safer alternatives. If an alternative has yet to be created, we lend our technical capabilities in material science as we work with our suppliers to develop entirely new chemistries. These new alternative materials face the same rigorous testing and evaluation against our high safety, performance, and environmental standards.\n\nSubstances we keep out of our products*\n\nPVC and phthalates\nReplaced with safer thermoplastic elastomers. Both are still used by other companies in power cords and headphone cables.\n\nBrominated flame retardants (BFRs)\nEliminated from thousands of parts such as enclosures, cables, circuit boards, and connectors in 2008. We use safer metal hydroxides and phosphorus compounds in their place.\n\nMercury\nEliminated from displays in 2009. We use energy-efficient, mercury-free LEDs and OLEDs instead of mercury-based fluorescent lamps in all our displays.\n\nLead\nPhased out of display glass and solder in 2006.\n\nArsenic\nEliminated from display glass since 2008. Arsenic was traditionally used in glass.\n\nBeryllium\nEliminated from all new product designs. Beryllium is found in copper alloys used to make connectors and springs.\n\nPFOA and PFOS\nEliminated PFOA and PFOS from our products, with RSS restrictions added in 2010 and 2013 respectively. These types of chemicals are commonly used in the manufacturing of water-resistant materials.\n\n* Apple\u2019s Regulated Substances Specification describes Apple\u2019s restrictions on the use of certain chemical substances in materials in Apple products, accessories, manufacturing processes, and packaging used for shipping products to Apple\u2019s end-customers. Restrictions are derived from international laws or directives, regulatory agencies, eco-label requirements, environmental standards, and Apple policies. Apple products are free of PVC and phthalates with the exception of AC power cords in India, Thailand (for 2-prong AC power cords), and South Korea, where we continue to seek government approval for our PVC and phthalates replacement. Apple products comply with the European Union Directive 2011/65/EU and its amendments, including exemptions for the use of lead. Apple is working to phase out the use of these exempted substances where technically possible.\nAnd we have a long history of leading in the identification and successful removal of potentially harmful substances. We've done so since the late 1990s, rigorously assessing chemicals and removing those that don't align with our goals. We phased out brominated flame retardants (BFRs) before this practice became a requirement and industry standard. Starting in 2010, we restricted the use of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) through our RSS, and in 2013 added restrictions for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). We were proactive on this, taking action ahead of global requirements because research showed that these chemicals remain persistent in the environment. Each phaseout we undertake requires developing alternatives, whether creating safer compounds to replace potentially harmful chemistries or replacing components with alternatives that meet our safety standards. In some cases, we've redesigned our products to eliminate the need for parts that incorporate potentially harmful chemicals.\n\nOur work has been recognized. Apple has received an A+ rating from Mind the Store, an external campaign that evaluates the largest retailers in North America on how they ensure the chemical safety of their products and packaging, for the past three years. We also ranked #1 of 50 retailers on the Mind the Store Retailer Report Card.\n\nWe're advocating for safer alternatives across our industry\n\nAs we work toward minimizing potentially harmful chemistries in our products and processes, we're also making the transition to safer alternatives accessible to others. Much of our focus centers on cleaners and degreasers \u2014 and building out a safer cleaners innovation ecosystem through multiple efforts. In 2021, Apple became a founding signatory of the Clean Electronics Production Network\u2019s (CEPN) Toward Zero Exposure program. CEPN, a multi-stakeholder initiative led by the NGO Green America, developed the Toward Zero Exposure platform to accelerate companies\u2019 efforts to eliminate the potential for worker exposure to hazardous chemicals, and boost awareness of the need to improve chemical management practices across the global electronics manufacturing industry. Apple contributed to developing CEPN's list of priority chemicals for substitution and has already eliminated the use of these nine chemicals in our supply chain.\n\nWe're also developing a new standard around cleaners \u2014 IPC-1402 \u2014 to define more clearly what qualifies as a \u201cgreen\u201d cleaner in electronics manufacturing. The standard builds on our success in managing cleaners used for final product assembly and applies that knowledge for cleaners used deeper in the supply chain at module and sub-assembly sites. We're aiming to reach both the chemistry and toxicology experts that conduct material assessments and the electronics engineering teams to lay out expectations on the use of safer cleaners. Our work on this standard is a collaborative effort involving more than 20 companies, which we expect to introduce in 2022.\n\nLast year, we also supported the development of a new certification for assessing the safety of cleaners used in the electronics industry and beyond in partnership with Clean Production Action (CPA) \u2014 a globally recognized NGO advocating for green chemicals and sustainable materials. The GreenScreen Certified\u2122 for Cleaners & Degreasers is a free and publicly available tool to assess and promote safer chemicals. It\u2019s part of an effort to drive broader, industry-wide change by making information about safer alternatives readily available to companies globally. We\u2019ve used the leading GreenScreen tool, as well as the EPA Safer Choice criteria, within our supply chain, leading to the transition of 100 percent of our final assembly sites to safer alternatives for cleaners and degreasers. The creation of a new certification will allow other companies beyond our supply chain to better protect workers making electronics products around the world.\n\nWe're also partnering with NGOs to make information about these materials readily available throughout the electronics industry. One effort is ChemFORWARD, a nonprofit collaboration of brands, retailers, suppliers, and environmental organizations that share high-quality, actionable chemical hazard assessment data via a globally harmonized repository. With ChemFORWARD, we'll share our list of safe cleaners and degreasers and our evaluation framework with companies beyond our suppliers and even our industry.\nEngagement\n\nContribute to change beyond our direct corporate footprint\nOur approach\n\nApple is committed to creating positive environmental impact. This includes the environmental challenges our world faces that extend far beyond our footprint as a company. As a member of the global community, we see it as part of our responsibility to engage with stakeholders doing impactful work directed at these challenges. This means working with others, learning from their feedback, and providing support where we can make a difference. We take advantage of opportunities to effect change both within and beyond our operations and supply chain. Engagement also allows us to respond to the world around us, looking for ways to play a positive role in the industries, issues, and communities where our involvement can be transformative.\n\nWorking with our stakeholders\n\nWe can better achieve a **TRANSFORMATIVE IMPACT** within our industry and for global communities when we work alongside a diverse group of stakeholders.\nAchieving change together\n\nWe\u2019re in conversation with stakeholders around the world\n\nThrough active engagement, we hear from stakeholders who bring different points of view and understanding of the issues we care about. Our conversations with policymakers, nonprofits, and community leaders help inform our understanding of how regulations, methods, and new technologies are evolving. They also help us learn, improve, and find new opportunities to overcome barriers to our environmental goals. We take action based on what we learn, whether that means aligning with the latest standards and best practices, or understanding the implications for cutting-edge research on our operations.\n\nJust this year, we conducted more than a dozen roundtables on environmental topics across the U.S., Europe, and China with key stakeholders, including members of academia and industry associations, to understand issues and regulations region by region. These forums also allowed us to share information on our efforts and understand where enhanced transparency would support those directly working on policy.\n\nWe\u2019re also working with the scientific community to understand new approaches and cutting-edge tools that can help us achieve our environmental goals. This includes our work with researchers at Carnegie Mellon University developing robotic recycling systems to enhance material recovery for Apple and others. We also continue to engage our Green Chemistry Advisory Board, an independent group including toxicologists and experts who advise on our smarter chemistry initiatives.\n\nThrough engagement, we refine our approach and work to industry standards and best practices. We look to cross-sector engagement platforms to help guide our programs and set standards for environmental efforts. In one initiative, we\u2019ve achieved Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) certification for a number of key Apple and supplier facilities, relying on the AWS\u2019s expertise in defining world-class water stewardship practices. We\u2019re also partnering with forestry experts at Conservation International as we invest in working forests through our Restore Fund.\n\nThe voices from within the business community, including our customers, employees, suppliers, industry partners, and investors, also motivate us to find ways we can support one another\u2019s environmental goals and push our efforts even further. As co-chairs of the United States Information Technology Office (USITO), a trade association representing the United States information and communications technology industry in China, we lead the environmental protection and energy efficiency working groups. In this role, we engage with other companies in China as we work to comply with new environmental regulation and engage with policymakers on future standards. We continually look for more opportunities to work with others \u2014 at an industry and national level \u2014 to receive feedback and make progress.\n\nIsabel Ge Mahe, Vice President and Managing Director for Apple Greater China speaks at the ceremony where Apple, the Suzhou Industrial Park Administrative Committee, and TEDA Eco Center signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). This collaboration aimed to support Suzhou Industrial Park in becoming the world\u2019s first industrial park to achieve certification to the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) standard.\nWe\u2019re supporting broader change across industries\n\nAn important part of our role within our industry is to influence change. Our industry can best achieve results through collective action on key environmental issues. And Apple can better realize our goals on climate, resources, and smarter chemistry when we actively share our experience and contribute to industry-wide improvements.\n\nTo facilitate efforts beyond our footprint, we engage in dozens of industry initiatives to share what we have learned and find new opportunities to advocate for change. As part of these partnerships and coalitions, we make direct contributions to the broader industry by creating tools and standards, and by pursuing policy objectives that support our shared goals. For example, as a co-design partner in ChemFORWARD, we\u2019re supporting the creation of a registry to expand the use of safer cleaners and degreasers, a part of our efforts to limit toxic chemical exposure and advance human and environmental equity.\n\nPolicy plays a key role in industry change, as well. And we actively advocate for policies that advance environmental objectives, from tackling climate change to enhancing material recovery. Learn more about our efforts on climate policy, page 31, and resource recovery policy, page 51.\n\nWhen it comes to taking action on environmental challenges, collective action matters. Which is why we\u2019re also making public commitments alongside our partners to signal the kind of change we are working to create. And by being transparent about our progress against these commitments, we hold ourselves and our partners accountable. We believe collective action can help us both address environmental challenges directly and serve as a catalyst for others to act.\n\n### Key industry engagements\n\n| Stakeholder | Our Engagement |\n|-------------|----------------|\n| Aluminum Stewardship Initiative | Supporting responsible sourcing within the aluminum value chain; recently completed an audit against their Performance Standard of environmental, social, and governance criteria.

(Member) |\nAt the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), we affirmed our support of the Clean Energy Demand Initiative (CEDI) launched by the U.S. State Department, which seeks to advance clean energy goals through corporate clean energy commitments. Through another energy initiative, RE100, we\u2019ve committed to 100 percent renewable electricity with members in markets across the globe. We also pledged to move to sustainable aviation fuel equal to 5 percent of our passenger air travel footprint by 2030 as part of the First Movers Coalition, a new platform for companies to create market demand for low-carbon technologies. We\u2019re investing in forestry and carbon removal, as well, backing projects that offer a financial return for investors and participating in initiatives, including The Forest Investor Club. (See page 29 for more detail on our Restore Fund.) And we continue to support the Paris Climate Agreement through the Race to Zero, a campaign to halve global emissions by 2030 through transparent action plans and robust near-term targets. This includes our role as a signatory to America Is All In, a declaration by 3800 state, tribal, local, and business leaders to meet the Paris Climate Agreement\u2019s goals.\n\nWe\u2019re also making commitments to address issues beyond climate change, including chemical safety and reducing the amount of plastics in our products. We\u2019ve joined the Toward Zero Exposure program with the Clean Electronics Production Network (CEPN), a multi-stakeholder initiative working to address health and safety challenges in the electronics supply chain. With the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, we\u2019ve pledged to eliminate plastics from our packaging by 2025.\n\nWe\u2019re collaborating with others to effect change in communities\n\nEngagement also means collaborating with those who have been addressing environmental injustice in their communities. There are opportunities for us to play a part in helping others achieve change. And we can also learn from the experiences of those working directly on these issues. We strive to integrate their points of view into our environmental approach, to respect their voices, and where possible, provide a broader context for them to be heard.\n\nWe also have an opportunity to contribute beyond our direct corporate operations \u2014 and outside our areas of expertise. This is where some of the most vital opportunities to support transformational change for communities can be found. We\u2019ve only just begun supporting those leading this important work, but we aim to contribute to the change these organizations are creating. We determine our grants based on the focus of each organization and their potential to affect change. And we recognize the importance of community-driven leadership on many issues by providing support where our contributions will yield results.\n\nEnvironmental justice groups have played a significant and vital role in advancing communities. To honor the ongoing commitment of these organizations, we\u2019ve made grants to minority-led and centered organizations that focus on environmental issues. Recent recipients include the Hispanic Access Foundation, which is working to address environmental hazards directly affecting the Latino community and establish bridges that provide equal access to a more healthy, natural environment, and First Nations Development Institute, which supports ecological stewardship and environmental justice within the Indigenous community. We\u2019ve also supported NDN Collective, Outdoor Afro, the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, and others.\nThrough giving, we can also catalyze nascent projects and technologies that may help the industry over the long term or simply contribute to other meaningful environmental causes. With the Alliance for Brazil, we\u2019re supporting efforts to restore areas within the Amazon forest that are under threat from forest fires. The Alliance\u2019s reforestation work also includes training and outreach programs to empower local communities in protection and governance practices, while developing and strengthening livelihood models that support economic development.\n\nWe also support the National Park Foundation in the U.S., which has provided more than 1,000,000 students with meaningful national park experiences since 2011, encouraging young people to connect with the natural world. In addition, we\u2019re backing the Foundation\u2019s work to advance outdoor equity by eliminating barriers and promoting access. And in the Chyulu Hills region of Kenya, we\u2019re supporting community empowerment programs for Maasai smallholder farmers, including educational scholarships for local students as well as pastureland management training.\n\nWith support from Apple and other partners, the National Park Foundation launched the ParkVentures program, investing in equity-focused outdoor leaders and organizations.

We\u2019re taking steps to make sure that businesses led by people of color are positioned to benefit from investments in environmental solutions.\n\nLast year, we welcomed the first class to our Impact Accelerator, a training and mentorship program for Black-, Hispanic/Latinx-, and Indigenous-owned businesses headquartered in the United States that share our focus on innovation and our commitment to the environment. Part of Apple\u2019s Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, the Accelerator aims to help combat systemic barriers to opportunity, while also advancing innovative solutions for communities most impacted by climate change. We selected our first class of 15 businesses on the cutting edge of green technology and clean energy to begin the program in August 2021. Each company selected is at least 51 percent owned, operated, and controlled by a Black-, Hispanic/Latinx-, or Indigenous individual and aligns closely with our environmental strategy, including our commitment to become carbon neutral by 2030. Many share a specific focus on bringing clean energy, opportunity, and vital services to vulnerable and underserved communities.\n\nThe three-month program included live virtual sessions, online courses on supply chain management, supplier diversity, financial and legal subjects, as well as one-on-one mentorship with an Apple expert on topics from renewable energy to responsible sourcing. The program culminated in Demo Week, an opportunity for participants to pitch decision-makers and business leaders within Apple. Following the program, every business was given the opportunity to attend a minority business executive leadership program through leading universities, and each participant has since engaged with our competitive services procurement process. These businesses then transitioned to Apple\u2019s Supplier Success community, to further foster the connections developed during the program.\n\nThe goal of the Impact Accelerator is to better position the participating companies for growth, to improve their abilities to take on larger contracts, and to expand their customer base \u2014 all while fostering their environmental commitment. By making connections between innovators, both in our inaugural class and at Apple, we\u2019re creating opportunities to support our shared goals. For example, last October we announced that we will be working with the Oceti Sakowin Power Authority, formed by six Sioux tribes to jointly develop tribal renewable energy resources, on a project to create a wind power development in the Midwest. And following the success of this year\u2019s class, our efforts continue. This spring, applications opened for the next class to join our Impact Accelerator.\n\n\u201cOn our journey to our 2030 carbon neutral goal for our supply chain and products, we\u2019re determined to help create a greener and more equitable future for all people. The businesses we\u2019re partnering with today are poised to become tomorrow\u2019s diverse and innovative industry leaders, creating ripples of change to help communities everywhere adapt to the urgent challenges posed by climate change.\u201d\n\nLisa Jackson\nApple\u2019s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives\n\nImpact Accelerator participant Karl Johnson leads Detroit-based Diversified Chemical Technologies, Inc., which promotes excellence, sustainability, and social responsibility in their chemical manufacturing.\nAppendix\n\nHolding ourselves ACCOUNTABLE to our progress\nAppendix\n\nAppendix A:\nEnvironmental data 84\nGreenhouse gas emissions 84\nApple\u2019s life cycle assessment methodology 85\nEnergy 86\nResources 87\nNormalizing factors 88\n\nAppendix B:\nCorporate facilities energy supplement 89\n\nAppendix C:\nAssurance and review statements 100\nGross comprehensive carbon footprint (Fraunhofer Institute) 101\nProduct end use program data (Apex) 106\nFacilities energy, carbon, waste, paper, and water data (Apex) 108\nSupplier clean energy program (Apex) 111\nSupplier clean energy efficiency program (Apex) 113\nPackaging plastic footprint (Fraunhofer Institute) 115\nComprehensive fiber footprint (Fraunhofer Institute) 118\n\nAppendix D:\nEnvironment, Health, and Safety Policy 121\n\nAppendix E:\nISO 14001 certification 122\n\nReport notes 124\n\nEnd notes 126\n## Appendix A\n\n### Greenhouse gas emissions\n\n| Corporate emissions\u00b9 (metric tons CO\u2082e) | Fiscal year |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------|\n|                                       | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 |\n| Scope 1 (gross emissions)             |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Natural gas, diesel, propane          | 40,070 | 39,340 | 40,910 | 42,840 | 36,210 |\n| Fleet vehicles                        | 12,090 | 4,270 | 6,950 | 11,110 | 8,300 |\n| Process emissions\u00b2                    | 3,040 | 3,830 | 4,870 | 3,490 | 2,540 |\n| Scope 2 (market-based)                | 2,780 | 0 | 0 | 8,730 | 36,250 |\n| Electricity                           | 0 | 0 | 0 | 8,730 | 36,250 |\n| Steam, heating, and cooling\u00b3          | 2,780 | - | - | - | - |\n| Scope 3 (gross emissions)\u2074           | 23,130,000 | 22,550,000 | 24,980,000 | 25,070,000 | 27,330,000 |\n| Business travel\u2075                      | 22,850 | 153,000 | 326,000 | 337,000 | 121,000 |\n| Employee commute\u2076                     | 85,570 | 134,000 | 195,000 | 183,000 | 172,000 |\n| Corporate carbon offsets\u2077             | -167,000 | -70,000 | - | - | - |\n| Product life cycle emissions\u2078 (metric tons CO\u2082e) |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Manufacturing (purchased goods and services) | 16,200,000 | 16,100,000 | 18,900,000 | 18,500,000 | 21,100,000 |\n| Product transportation (upstream and downstream) | 1,750,000 | 1,800,000 | 1,400,000 | 1,300,000 | 1,200,000 |\n| Product use (use of sold products)    | 4,990,000 | 4,300,000 | 4,100,000 | 4,700,000 | 4,700,000 |\n| End-of-life treatment                 | 80,000 | 60,000 | 60,000 | 50,000 | 40,000 |\n| Product carbon offsets\u2079               | -500,000 | - | - | - | - |\n| Total gross carbon footprint (without offsets)\u00b9\u2070 (metric tons CO\u2082e) | 23,200,000 | 22,600,000 | 25,100,000 | 25,200,000 | 27,500,000 |\n| Total net carbon footprint (after applying offsets)\u00b9\u2070 (metric tons CO\u2082e) | 22,530,000 | 22,530,000 | 25,100,000 | 25,200,000 | 27,500,000 |\n\n1. Apple is carbon neutral for corporate emissions as of April 2020.\n2. Emissions from R&D processes.\n3. Beginning in FY2021, we\u2019re accounting for scope 2 emissions from the purchase of district heating, chilled water, and steam.\n4. In fiscal year 2017, we started calculating scope 3 emissions not listed above. In fiscal year 2021, these include electricity transmission and distribution losses amounted to about 28,000 metric tons CO\u2082e and life cycle emissions associated with renewable energy amounted to about 95,000 metric tons CO\u2082e. We have not accounted for emissions resulting from employees working from home, because we anticipated these emissions are small relative to our carbon footprint and we are still evolving our methodology.\n5. We regularly revisit our methodology to hold ourselves to high accountability standards. So in fiscal year 2018, we changed how we calculate emissions from business travel in order to better account for classes of service in air travel. As a result of this change, our scope 3 transportation emissions increased by 77 percent between 2017 and 2018. Without the methodology change, these emissions would have increased by 14 percent, which reflects the growth in our business.\n6. Beginning in fiscal year 2020, we updated our methodology to reflect the impact of COVID-19 on employee commute.\n7. We retired 167,000 metric tons of carbon credits from the Chyulu Hills project in Kenya to maintain carbon neutrality for our corporate emissions in fiscal year 2021. The project is certified to the VCS and CCB standards.\n8. Because we\u2019re committed to accuracy and transparency, we regularly refine our product life cycle assessment model and sources of data. For example, we recently obtained more granular data summarizing in which countries our products are sold and used, resulting in more granularity possible for grid emission factors used in the carbon footprint of the product use phase. The net result was an increase in our 2021 carbon footprint. When using the same level of data granularity and model as 2021, our product use carbon emissions in 2021 would have been about 2.5 percent lower.\n9. For fiscal year 2021, we retired credits from the Chyulu Hills project in Kenya, and purchased carbon credits from two additional projects to offset a total of 500,000 metric tons of direct emissions across our value chain. The first project, a REDD+ coastal conservation project in Guatemala, protects and conserves forests from deforestation and degradation. The second project aims to establish forests on about 46,000 hectares of barren land that is not otherwise used across seven counties in the Guizhou Province of China. Both projects are certified to the same high standards that we require for projects in the Restore Fund, including VCS and CCBs. These projects are all certified to the VCS and CCB standards.\n10. Due to rounding, our gross and net carbon footprints do not always the sum of the subtotals disclosed above.\n\nNotes: For data on previous years, please reference past Environmental Progress Reports, available at apple.com/environment. Dash indicates data that are not available. Due to rounding, totals may not be the sum of the subtotals above.\nApple uses five steps when conducting a product life cycle assessment (LCA):\n\n1. To model the manufacturing phase, we use part-by-part measurements of the entire product along with data on part production. The measurements help us accurately determine the size and weight of the components and materials in the product, while data on manufacturing processes and yield loss during production allows us to account for the impact of manufacturing. The LCA includes accessories and packaging, as well as decreased emissions through Apple\u2019s Supplier Clean Energy Program. When calculating Apple\u2019s comprehensive carbon footprint, we also include units that are repaired and replaced through AppleCare.\n\n2. To model customer use, we measure the power consumed by a product while it is running in a simulated scenario. Daily usage patterns are specific to each product and are a mixture of actual and modeled customer use data. For the purposes of our assessment, years of use, which are based on first owners, are modeled to be four years for macOS and tvOS devices and three years for iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS devices. Most Apple products last longer and are often passed along, resold, or returned to Apple by the first owner for others to use. More information on our product energy use is provided in our Product Environmental Reports.\n\n3. To model transportation, we use data collected on shipments of single products and multipack units by land, sea, and air. We account for transporting materials between manufacturing sites; transporting products from manufacturing sites to regional distribution hubs; transporting products from regional distribution hubs to individual customers; and transporting products from final customers to recycling facilities.\n\n4. To model end of life, we use material composition data on our products and estimate the ratio of products that are sent to recycling or disposal. For products sent to recycling, we capture the initial processing by the recycler to prepare the product for recovery of electronic, metal, plastic, and glass material streams. Subsequent downstream recycling processes are not included, as these are considered stages of production and not end-of-life processing. For products sent to disposal, we capture the emissions associated with landfilling or incineration of each type of material.\n\n5. After we collect data about manufacturing, use, transportation, and end of life, we combine it with detailed greenhouse gas emission data. This emission data is based on a combination of Apple-specific and industry-average datasets for material production, manufacturing processes, electricity generation, and transportation. Renewable energy used in the supply chain, initiated by suppliers independently or through the Apple Supplier Clean Energy Program, is also accounted for within the LCA model. Combining product-specific information with emission data in our LCA allows us to compile detailed results for greenhouse gas emissions as they relate to each product. The data and modeling approaches are checked for quality and accuracy by the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany.\n\nThere is inherent uncertainty in modeling carbon emissions due primarily to data limitations. For the top component contributors to Apple\u2019s carbon emissions, Apple addresses this uncertainty by developing detailed process-based environmental models with Apple-specific parameters. For the remaining elements of Apple\u2019s carbon footprint, we rely on industry average data and assumptions.\n## Appendix A\n\n### Energy\n\n| Corporate facilities energy use | Unit | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 |\n|---------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| **Electricity**                |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Total                           | MWh  | 2,854,000 | 2,580,000 | 2,427,000 | 2,182,000 | 1,832,000 |\n| U.S.                            | MWh  | 2,377,000 | 2,192,000 | 2,075,000 | 1,830,000 | 1,536,000 |\n| International                   | MWh  | 477,000 | 389,000 | 351,000 | 351,000 | 296,000 |\n| **Fuel**                        |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Total                           | MWh  | 467,280 | 439,170 | 462,680 | 494,460 | 420,650 |\n| Natural gas                     | MWh  | 203,010 | 202,360 | 202,340 | 204,970 | 174,420 |\n| Biogas                          | MWh  | 208,620 | 210,820 | 217,140 | 226,660 | 193,280 |\n| Propane liquid                  | MWh  | 40 | 140 | 280 | 280 | 280 |\n| Gasoline                        | MWh  | 34,880 | 14,910 | 23,950 | 37,740 | 31,310 |\n| Diesel (other)                  | MWh  | 9,780 | 9,610 | 16,450 | 20,270 | 20,670 |\n| Diesel (mobile combustion)      | MWh  | 10,950 | 1,330 | 2,520 | 4,540 | 690 |\n| **Other**                       |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Steam, heating, and cooling1    | MWh  | 22,480 | - | - | - | - |\n\n| Energy efficiency2             |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Corporate facilities           |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Electricity savings3           | MWh/year | 260,390 | 244,690 | 208,640 | 113,200 | 69,980 |\n| Fuel savings                   | mmBTU/year | 299,780 | 297,090 | 277,120 | 254,140 | 245,340 |\n| Supplier facilities3           |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Electricity savings            | MWh/year | 1,418,825,350 | 1,101,440 | 943,890 | 798,930 | 473,510 |\n| Fuel savings                   | mmBTU/year | 1,047,440 | 752,680 | 25,120 | 25,120 | 5,620 |\n\n| Renewable electricity          |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Corporate facilities           |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Renewable electricity use      | MWh  | 2,854,000 | 2,580,000 | 2,430,000 | 2,170,000 | 1,770,000 |\n| % Renewable electricity4      | percent of total energy | 100% | 100% | 100% | 99% | 97% |\n| Scope 2 emissions avoided      | metric tons CO\u2082e | 1,063,720 | 948,000 | 899,000 | 690,000 | 589,000 |\n| Supply chain5                  |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Renewable electricity capacity (operational) | GW | 10.3 | 4.5 | 2.7 | 1.9 | 1.2 |\n| Renewable electricity capacity (committed) | GW | 15.9 | 7.9 | 5.1 | 3.3 | 2 |\n| Renewable electricity use      | MWh  | 18,100,000 | 11,400,000 | 5,700,000 | 4,100,000 | 1,900,000 |\n\nNotes: For data on years prior to 2017, please reference past Environmental Progress Reports, available at [www.apple.com/environment](http://www.apple.com/environment). Dash indicates data that are not available.\n\n1. Beginning in FY2021, we\u2019re accounting for the purchase of district heating, chilled water, and steam.\n2. Because energy efficiency measures have lasting benefits, energy efficiency savings are calculated cumulatively since 2012. All efficiency measures are retired based on their effective useful lifetime as documented by the California Energy Commission. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, corporate facilities energy use declined temporarily as we adjusted lighting and climate controls due to shutdowns and reduced occupancy. These savings are not included in the total savings from our energy efficiency program initiatives. We also recognize that energy use at our employees\u2019 homes likely increased during this period. We have not accounted for this energy use, because we anticipated this impact is small relative to our overall energy use and we are still evolving our methodology.\n3. Energy savings from supplier energy efficiency improvements are reported as annualized annual numbers. Prior to 2020, supplier energy savings are calculated on a calendar year basis. Beginning in 2020, supplier energy savings are calculated based on the fiscal year.\n4. Beginning January 1, 2018, 100 percent of the electricity we use to power our global facilities is sourced from renewable energy.\n5. Supply chain renewable electricity capacity (operational) and renewable electricity use for FY2021 do not include REC purchases Apple made, equivalent to 0.3 GW and 500,000 MWh, respectively, to address a small increase to its carbon footprint.\n## Appendix A\n\n### Resources\n\n| KPI                        | Unit          | Fiscal year |\n|----------------------------|---------------|-------------|\n|                            |               | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 |\n| **Water**                  |               |       |      |      |      |      |\n| Corporate facilities       | Total         | million gallons | 1,407 | 1,287 | 1,291 | 1,258 | 1,000 |\n|                            | Freshwater\u00b9   | million gallons | 1,259 | 1,168 | 1,178 | 1,190 | 973   |\n|                            | Recycled water\u00b2 | million gallons | 141   | 113   | 106   | 63    | 24    |\n|                            | Other alternative sources\u00b3 | million gallons | 7     | 5     | 7     | 4     | 3     |\n| Supply chain               | Freshwater saved | million gallons | 12,300 | 10,800 | 9,300 | 7,600 | 5,100 |\n| **Waste**                  |               |       |      |      |      |      |\n| Corporate facilities       | Landfill diversion rate | percent | 68% | 70% | 66% | 67% | 71% |\n|                            | Landfilled (municipal solid waste) | pounds | 33,202,200 | 25,826,550 | 38,317,120 | 32,372,890 | 31,595,200 |\n|                            | Recycled      | pounds | 73,489,220 | 63,812,300 | 72,338,130 | 66,380,630 | 68,509,300 |\n|                            | Composted     | pounds | 4,844,960  | 6,302,410  | 10,882,120 | 10,397,430 | 14,567,500 |\n|                            | Hazardous waste | pounds | 3,525,840  | 4,053,770  | 6,096,600  | 6,277,800  | 3,342,700  |\n|                            | Waste to energy | pounds | 657,890    | 786,250    | 1,129,080  | 1,105,140  | 645,000    |\n| Supply chain               | Waste diverted from landfill | metric tons | 491,000 | 400,000 | 322,000 | 375,000 | 351,000 |\n| **Product packaging footprint** |               |       |      |      |      |      |\n| Total packaging            | metric tons   | 257,000 | 226,000 | 189,000 | 187,000 | 169,000 |\n| Recycled fiber             | percent       | 63% | 60% | 59% | 58% | 56% |\n| Responsibly sourced virgin fiber\u2075 | percent | 33% | 35% | 33% | 32% | 30% |\n| Plastic                    | percent       | 4% | 6% | 8% | 10% | 14% |\n\n1. We define freshwater as drinking-water quality, the majority of which comes from municipal sources and less than 5 percent comes from onsite groundwater sources.\n2. Recycled water represents a key alternative water source. Our recycled water is sourced primarily from municipal treatment plants, with less than 5 percent from onsite treatment. Recycled water is primarily used for irrigation, make-up water in cooling, or toilet flushing.\n3. Other alternative sources of water include rainwater and recovered condensate that is captured onsite. Water used for construction activities like dust control is not included in this total, and represents 13 million gallons of water used in fiscal year 2021.\n4. Total does not include construction and demolition waste nor electronic waste. We\u2019re refining our methodology for collecting this data and plan to include it in future years. We have also re-stated the total for 2018 without these categories of waste.\n5. Responsible sourcing of wood fiber is defined in Apple\u2019s Sustainable Fiber Specification. Since 2017, all of the virgin wood fiber used in our packaging has come from responsible sources.\n## Appendix A\n\n### Normalizing factors*\n\n|                      | Fiscal year |\n|----------------------|-------------|\n|                      | 2021        | 2020        | 2019        | 2018        | 2017        |\n| **Net sales (in millions)** | $365,817    | $274,515    | $260,174    | $265,595    | $229,234    |\n| **Number of full-time equivalent employees** | 154,000     | 147,000     | 137,000     | 132,000     | 123,000     |\n\n* As reported in Apple\u2019s Form 10-K Annual Report filed with the SEC.\nAppendix B\n\nCorporate facilities energy supplement\n\nUse of renewable energy at our facilities has been a central component of our emissions reduction strategy since 2011. We\u2019ve learned a lot about how best to secure renewable energy, which has helped us educate suppliers and expand our renewable energy efforts into our supply chain. This appendix summarizes the types of renewable energy solutions we\u2019ve deployed, and details how we implement renewable energy at our data centers \u2014 our largest energy loads.\n\nHow we procure renewable energy\n\nSince launching our renewable energy program in 2011, we have implemented a number of solutions to procure renewable energy. Our strategy has evolved over time to create the most positive impact.\n\nOwnership and PURPA\n\nIn 2011, Apple\u2019s 100 percent equity ownership of our Maiden solar arrays was the first time a non-energy commercial company built its own utility-scale solar PV project. We used a 1978 federal law called the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) to structure the project. We then applied this same structure to two more large solar PV and biogas fuel cell projects in North Carolina and two micro-hydro projects in Oregon. This was a landmark moment in corporate renewable energy development and led to an increased use of PURPA in these states.\n\nDirect Access\n\nSince 2012, in California and Oregon, we\u2019ve used a program called Direct Access to bypass the default electricity generation offered by the utilities servicing our data centers in those states. Instead, we contracted directly with independent power producers who could supply 100 percent renewable electricity.\n\nAfter initially buying from existing, third-party owned projects, we\u2019re now procuring renewable energy from projects we created: The Solar Star II and Montague Wind projects deliver renewables to our Oregon data center, and the California Flats solar project to our data center, offices, and retail stores in California.\n\nGreen Rider\n\nIn 2013, we opened a new data center in Reno, Nevada. With no PURPA or Direct Access options in Nevada, we worked directly with the local utility, NV Energy, to create a whole new regulatory structure. The \u201cNevada Green Rider\u201d enables us to secure a long-term, fixed-price contract for renewable electricity from a new solar PV project built for us, but managed by the utility. We\u2019ve used this partnership to create four solar projects totaling 320 megawatts.\n\nEquity investment\n\nIn 2014, we invested in two 20-megawatt solar PV projects in Sichuan, China, to support all of our in-country retail stores, corporate offices, and data storage facilities. This project represented the first time a commercial company created a new large-scale project in China for its own use. We\u2019ve since replicated this model many times for Apple\u2019s supply chain.\n\nPortfolio solutions\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, we adapted to land scarcity constraints in Singapore and Japan by contracting for solar PV on 800 rooftops in Singapore and 300 in Japan. We adapted our approach in each country to fit local partnerships and regulatory structures: We signed a long-term agreement similar to a power purchase agreement in Singapore and made an equity investment in Japan. These projects offer us long-term flexibility as our load grows.\n\nRenewable microgrid\n\nSince 2017, we\u2019ve been powering Apple Park with 100 percent renewable energy \u2014 about 75 percent of which is generated onsite and managed by a microgrid. The onsite generation comes from 14 megawatts of rooftop solar PV and 4 megawatts of baseload biogas fuel cells. Any additional energy required is drawn by Direct Access from the California Flats solar project in nearby Monterey County. The microgrid system with battery storage manages the renewable energy generation and the building\u2019s energy use; optimizes demand management, load shifting, and frequency regulation services; and ensures uninterrupted energy reliability against local grid outages.\nFacilities renewable energy projects\n\nTo reach 100 percent renewable electricity for Apple\u2019s own facilities, Apple has helped to create 1549 MW of renewable energy around the world. The projects listed to the right represent Apple-created renewable energy projects supporting Apple facilities\u2019 electricity use and contributing to cleaner grids around the world. Operational projects apply a mix of clean energy technology including wind (22.9 percent), solar (76.0 percent), micro-hydro (0.21 percent), and biogas fuel cells (0.9 percent).\n\nThis table represents all operational renewable energy projects that Apple has helped create.\n\n| Location     | Renewable energy technology | Size (MW) |\n|--------------|----------------------------|-----------|\n| Australia    | PV                         | 0.5       |\n| Brazil       | Wind                       | 0.5       |\n| China mainland | PV                      | 130       |\n| Colombia     | PV                         | 0.2       |\n| Denmark      | PV                         | 42        |\n| Denmark      | Wind                       | 17        |\n| France       | PV                         | <0.1      |\n| India        | PV                         | 2         |\n| Israel       | PV                         | 5         |\n| Japan        | PV                         | 12        |\n| Mexico       | Wind                       | 0.8       |\n| Philippines  | PV                         | 0.1       |\n| Singapore    | PV                         | 35        |\n| South Africa | PV                         | 0.2       |\n| Taiwan       | PV                         | 1         |\n| Turkey       | PV                         | 4         |\n| USA (AZ)     | PV                         | 55        |\n| USA (CA)     | Biogas fuel cell           | 4         |\n| USA (CA)     | PV                         | 146       |\n| USA (IL)     | Wind                       | 112       |\n| USA (NC)     | Biogas fuel cell           | 10        |\n| USA (NC)     | PV                         | 164       |\n| USA (NV)     | PV                         | 320       |\n| USA (OR)     | Micro-hydro                | 3         |\n| USA (OR)     | PV                         | 125       |\n| USA (OR)     | Wind                       | 200       |\n| USA (TX)     | PV                         | 1         |\n| USA (TX)     | Wind                       | 25        |\n| USA (VA)     | PV                         | 133.6     |\n\n**Total** 1549\n\nNote: Data current as of February 2022 (operational).\n### Fiscal year 2021 energy and carbon footprint (corporate facilities)\n\nThe chart below provides a detailed breakdown of fiscal year 2021 energy use, which we used to calculate our greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n| Location                  | Scope 1 Total gas (mmBTU) | Renewable biogas (mmBTU) | Scope 1 emissions (metric tons CO\u2082e) | Scope 2 Electricity (million kWh) | Renewable electricity (million kWh) | Scope 2 emissions (metric tons CO\u2082e)\u00b9 |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Corporate                 | 830,190                   | 202,978                  | 33,369                               | 730                              | 730                                 | 0                                    |\n| Cupertino, CA             | 673,446                   | 202,978                  | 24,999                               | 370                              | 370                                 | 0                                    |\n| Elk Grove, CA             | 10,202                    | -

Beginning in fiscal year 2021 we are also accounting for purchased steam, heating, and cooling which amounts to 2780 metric tons of scope 2 emissions.\n\n2. We\u2019ve updated our fiscal year 2016 colocation facilities footprint to reflect more accurately Apple\u2019s operational boundaries. Per the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol, we\u2019ve removed electricity use associated with colocation facility cooling and building operations. This energy use, however, is still covered by renewable energy.\nA focus on data centers\n\nWe used over 1.96 billion kWh of electricity in fiscal year 2021 to power our data centers and colocation facilities around the world. We\u2019re proud that 100 percent of that electricity came from clean, renewable sources including solar, wind, biogas fuel cells, and low-impact hydro power. To cover our needs, we build our own renewable power projects and work with utilities to purchase clean energy from locally obtained resources. We\u2019re staying at 100 percent even as Apple\u2019s data center presence continues to grow.\n\nMaiden, North Carolina\nSolar + Biogas Fuel Cells\n100 percent renewable since opening June 2010\n\nBetween 2011 and 2015, we installed 68 megawatts of Apple-created projects: two 20-megawatt solar projects, an 18-megawatt solar project, and 10 megawatts of biogas fuel cells. We then partnered with the local utility, Duke Energy, to help build five solar projects through its Green Source Rider program. These solar projects came online beginning in 2015 and were Duke Energy\u2019s first Green Source Rider projects to become operational. We worked with Duke Energy for several years to develop this green energy tariff option, which allowed Apple and Duke Energy to work together to develop new renewable energy projects. The five Green Source Rider projects have a combined capacity of 22 megawatts. In 2017, we made long-term commitments to five more solar projects in North Carolina, for an additional 85 megawatts of clean energy. In fiscal year 2021, the Maiden data center was supported by projects that generated 392 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the energy used by over 31,000 homes in North Carolina for a year. Use of renewable energy allowed us to avoid over 106,000 metric tons of CO\u2082e during the fiscal year.\n\nEnergy efficiency measures we\u2019ve implemented at our Maiden data centers include use of outside air cooling through a waterside economizer during night and cool-weather hours, which, along with water storage, allows the chillers to be idle 75 percent of the time.\n\nMaiden, North Carolina: Grid mix vs. Apple-sourced renewable energy\nElectricity use in fiscal year 2021: 392 million kWh\n\n| Default grid mix (North Carolina) | (%) |\n|----------------------------------|-----|\n| Coal                             | 23  |\n| Gas                              | 31  |\n| Nuclear                          | 32  |\n| Hydro                            | 5   |\n| Renewable                        | 8   |\n| Other                            | <1  |\n\n| Apple actual renewable energy use | (%) |\n|-----------------------------------|-----|\n| Apple\u2019s solar projects            | 77  |\n| Apple\u2019s biogas fuel cells         | 14  |\n| Duke Green Source Rider (100 percent solar) | 10  |\n\nSource: Actual fiscal year 2021 energy data.

It\u2019s our largest project to date, producing over 562 million kWh of clean, renewable energy a year.\n\nThis is in addition to our power purchase agreement for the 56-megawatt Solar Star Oregon II project located just a few miles from our data center. This solar PV project, which came online and began supporting the data center in 2017, produces 141 million kWh of renewable energy per year. To strengthen the connection between Apple and these projects, we use Oregon\u2019s Direct Access program to supply the renewable energy from these projects directly to our data center.\n\nAlso supporting the data center are two micro-hydro projects that harness the power of water flowing through local irrigation canals that have been operating for over 60 years. In fiscal year 2021, these micro-hydro projects generated nearly 3 million kWh of renewable energy. To supplement these projects, we executed a long-term purchase agreement for all environmental attributes from a 69-megawatt portfolio of eight solar projects in Oregon.\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, the Prineville data center was supported by projects that generated 279 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the energy used by over 25,000 homes in Oregon for a year. Use of renewable energy allowed us to avoid over 196,000 metric tons of CO\u2082e during the fiscal year.\n\nOur Prineville data center takes advantage of the cool and dry climate by cooling its servers with outside air whenever possible. Indirect evaporative cooling is enabled when the outside air temperature gets too high to cool the servers with outside air alone.\n\nPrineville, Oregon: Grid mix vs. Apple-sourced renewable energy\nElectricity use in fiscal year 2021: 279 million kWh\n\n| Default grid mix (Oregon) | (%) |\n|--------------------------|-----|\n| Coal                     | 4   |\n| Gas                      | 34  |\n| Hydro                    | 49  |\n| Renewable                | 14  |\n\nSource: eGrid 2019.

So, in 2013, we created a partnership with the local utility, NV Energy, to develop the Fort Churchill Solar project. Apple designed, financed, and constructed the project, and NV Energy operates it and directs all the renewable energy it produces to our data center. The Fort Churchill Solar project uses a photovoltaic panel with curved mirrors that concentrate sunlight. The 20-megawatt array has an annual production capacity of over 43 million kWh.\n\nTo facilitate further renewable development in Nevada, Apple worked with NV Energy and the Nevada utility commission to create a green energy option open to all commercial customers, called the Nevada Green Rider, that does not require the customer to fund project development up-front.\n\nThanks to this new option, in 2015 we announced our second Nevada solar project, the 50-megawatt Boulder Solar II project. This project came online in 2017, producing about 137 million kWh of renewable energy per year. We have used the Nevada Green Rider two more times, first for the 200-megawatt Techren Solar II project. Apple\u2019s largest solar project to date, it is estimated to produce over 540 million kWh per year and came online in late 2019.\n\nNext was the 50-megawatt Turquoise Nevada project, which came online in late 2020. The project is estimated to produce 110 million kWh of renewable energy per year. In fiscal year 2021, the Reno data center was supported by projects that generated 396 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the energy used by nearly 34,000 homes in Nevada for a year. Use of renewable energy allowed us to avoid more than 106,000 metric tons of CO\u2082e during the fiscal year.\n\nLike in Prineville, our Reno data center takes advantage of the mild climate by cooling its servers with outside air whenever possible. When the outside air is too warm to cool the servers alone, it draws from indirect evaporative cooling.\n\nReno, Nevada: Grid mix vs. Apple-sourced renewable energy\nElectricity use in fiscal year 2021: 395 million kWh\n\n| Default grid mix (Nevada) | (%) |\n|---------------------------|-----|\n| Coal                      | 7   |\n| Gas                       | 65  |\n| Hydro                     | 6   |\n| Renewable                 | 23  |\n\nSource: eGrid 2019.

We hit this milestone in January 2013, when we began serving the data center with energy sourced primarily from California wind power.\n\nWe acquired this energy directly from the wholesale market through California\u2019s Direct Access program.\n\nIn 2017, Apple\u2019s 130-megawatt California Flats solar project in nearby Monterey County came online, and now we use Direct Access to supply power from that project directly to our data center as well as other Apple facilities in California.\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, the Newark data center was supported by projects that generated 71 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the energy used by nearly 10,000 homes in California for a year. Use of renewable energy allowed us to avoid more than 5000 metric tons of CO\u2082e during the fiscal year.\n\nNewark, California: Grid mix vs. Apple-sourced renewable energy\n\nElectricity use in fiscal year 2021: 71 million kWh\n\n| Default grid mix (California) | (%) |\n|------------------------------|-----|\n| Coal                         | <1  |\n| Gas                          | 43  |\n| Nuclear                      | 8   |\n| Hydro                        | 19  |\n| Renewable                    | 29  |\n| Other                        | 1   |\n\nSource: eGrid 2019.

To support this facility, we partnered with the local utility, the Salt River Project (SRP), to build the 50-megawatt Bonnybrooke solar project, which became operational in December 2016. This project produces over 148 million kWh of clean, renewable energy a year, which roughly matches the energy used by the data center.\n\nAs the Mesa data center grew, it became apparent that we needed additional sources of renewable energy to maintain our 100 percent renewable electricity goal.\n\nWe began to explore onsite solar options at the data center and determined that we could provide valuable shaded parking that paid for itself through energy bill reductions while adding to our renewable energy portfolio. The resulting PV facility includes five elevated parking canopies and three ground-mounted arrays, for a total generating capacity of 4.67 MW. The onsite PV system began commercial operation in February 2019 and is expected to generate 9000 MWh per year.\n\nIn addition, we began working with SRP to develop a customer renewable energy program in 2017, resulting in their Sustainable Energy Initiative, launched in 2019, to provide a diverse mix of commercial electric customers with new renewable energy at an affordable price. Under this program, Apple has executed an agreement with SRP to purchase a portion of the output of their proposed 100 MW Central Line PV Facility, expected to begin operations in 2022.\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, the Mesa data center was supported by 332 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the energy used by over 25,000 Arizona homes. Use of renewable energy allowed us to avoid more than 144,000 metric tons of CO\u2082e during the fiscal year.\n\nMesa, Arizona: Grid mix vs. Apple-sourced renewable energy\n\nElectricity use in fiscal year 2021: 332 million kWh\n\n| Default grid mix (Arizona) | (%) |\n|----------------------------|-----|\n| Coal                       | 21  |\n| Gas                        | 41  |\n| Nuclear                    | 28  |\n| Hydro                      | 6   |\n| Renewable                  | 5   |\n\nSource: eGrid 2019.

Our Northern Jutland PV project achieved commercial operation in late 2019, will meet all of the data center\u2019s near-term energy needs, and at 42 megawatts, is one of Denmark\u2019s largest solar power plants. Our second renewable project in Denmark, a 17 MW wind project, also came online in late 2020. We have secured long-term supply contracts with both Danish renewable projects, which will scale up as our data center loads grow.\n\nDenmark: Grid mix vs. Apple-sourced renewable energy\n\nElectricity use in fiscal year 2021: 15 million kWh\n\n| Default grid mix (Denmark) | (%) |\n|----------------------------|-----|\n| Coal                       | 11  |\n| Gas                        | 4   |\n| Renewable                  | 78  |\n| Other                      | 7   |\n\nSource: International Energy Agency 2021.

Emergency generators must be exercised periodically to ensure their operational reliability. These preventative maintenance activities as well as emergency operations during power outages consume diesel fuel and result in air pollutant emissions. As a source of air pollutant emissions, the emergency generators at Apple\u2019s data centers are operated under air permits issued by regulatory agencies. These permits require monitoring, testing, inspection, and reporting at regular intervals.\n\nWe\u2019ve voluntarily installed emissions control systems on our emergency generators to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulates. And we\u2019re standardizing our approach to preventative maintenance activities to minimize annual testing hours.\n\nTo further reduce air emissions at our data centers, we\u2019re finding innovative ways to minimize the use of diesel-powered emergency generators. In Denmark, we\u2019ve deployed a new substation design, in conjunction with the local utility, with the highest level of resiliency and automation. It will allow Apple to eliminate emergency generators altogether\u2014in addition to eliminating air emissions associated with diesel fuel delivery. At our data centers in Nevada, North Carolina, and Oregon, we have added a second transmission line, which increases the reliability of the power supply and, therefore, minimizes the need for emergency operation of the generators.\n\nAs the data centers further expand, we will continue to source renewable electricity in country to support the growth with renewable electricity.\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, the China data center was supported by 58 million kWh of renewable energy, avoiding more than 36,000 metric tons of CO\u2082e during the fiscal year.13\n\n13. Emissions avoided are calculated using the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology for calculating market-based emissions.\nOur colocation facilities\n\nThe majority of our online services are provided by our own data centers; however, we also use third-party colocation facilities for additional data center capacity. While we don\u2019t own these shared facilities and use only a portion of their total capacity, we include our portion of their energy use in our renewable energy goals.\n\nStarting in January 2018, 100 percent of our power for colocation facilities was matched with renewable energy generated within the same state or NERC region for facilities in the United States, or within the same country or regional grid for those around the world. As our loads grow over time, we\u2019ll continue working with our colocation suppliers to match 100 percent of our energy use with renewables.\n\nFurthermore, we worked with one of our main suppliers of colocation services to help it develop the capability to provide renewable energy solutions to its customers. This partnership advances Apple\u2019s renewable energy program and those of other companies that use this colocation provider.\n\nThird-party computing\n\nBeyond the use of our own data centers and colocation facilities, we also use third-party services to support some of our on-demand cloud computing and storage services. We are requiring these suppliers to adopt a 100 percent renewable energy strategy for their Apple energy use, and we continue to work with our suppliers to refine estimates for the carbon emissions associated with their services.\n\n| Total energy use (kWh) | Renewable energy (kWh) | Default utility emissions\\(^{14}\\) (metric tons CO\\(_2\\)e) | Apple\u2019s emissions \u2013 including renewable energy\\(^{15}\\) (metric tons CO\\(_2\\)e) | Percent renewable energy\\(^{16}\\) |\n|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|\n| FY2011                 | 42,500                 | 0                               | 10                              | 10                     | 0%                     |\n| FY2012                 | 38,552,300             | 1,471,680                       | 17,200                          | 16,500                 | 4%                     |\n| FY2013                 | 79,462,900             | 46,966,900                      | 31,800                          | 14,500                 | 59%                    |\n| FY2014                 | 108,659,700            | 88,553,400                      | 44,300                          | 11,000                 | 81%                    |\n| FY2015                 | 142,615,000            | 121,086,100                     | 60,500                          | 12,700                 | 85%                    |\n| FY2016\\(^{17}\\)        | 145,520,900            | 143,083,200                     | 66,300                          | 1,600                  | 98%                    |\n| FY2017                 | 289,195,800            | 286,378,100                     | 125,600                         | 1,500                  | 99%                    |\n| FY2018                 | 327,663,800            | 326,959,700                     | 146,600                         | 400                    | 99.8%                  |\n| FY2019                 | 339,047,649            | 339,047,649                     | 146,400                         | 0                      | 100%                   |\n| FY2020                 | 372,901,398            | 372,901,398                     | 153,459                         | 0                      | 100%                   |\n| FY2021                 | 384,727,076            | 384,727,076                     | 146,780                         | 0                      | 100%                   |\n\n14. We calculate \u201cdefault utility emissions\u201d to provide baseline emissions of what our carbon footprint would have been without the use of renewable energy. This allows us to demonstrate the savings resulting from our renewable energy program.\n\n15. Apple\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions are calculated using the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology for calculating market-based emissions.\n\n16. We calculate our progress toward our 100 percent renewable energy goal on a calendar year basis, while the numbers reported in this table are based on fiscal year. Beginning January 1, 2018, all of the electricity use at our colocation facilities is from 100 percent renewable energy.\n\n17. Over the past few years, we have been installing submeters in colocation facilities to better track electricity usage. Beginning in FY2016, we started reporting this submetered electricity usage. Prior to fiscal year 2016, reported electricity usage was conservatively estimated based on maximum contract capacity quantities. We\u2019ve updated our fiscal year 2016 colocation facilities footprint to reflect more accurately Apple\u2019s operational boundaries. Per the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol, we\u2019ve removed from our electricity usage and scope 2 calculations those emissions associated with colocation facility cooling and building operations.\nAppendix C\n\nAssurance and review statements\n\nGross comprehensive carbon footprint (Fraunhofer Institute)\nProduct end use program data (Apex)\nFacilities energy, carbon, waste, paper, and water data (Apex)\nSupplier clean energy program (Apex)\nSupplier clean energy efficiency program (Apex)\nPackaging plastic footprint (Fraunhofer Institute)\nComprehensive fiber footprint (Fraunhofer Institute)\nLetter of Assurance\nComprehensive Carbon Footprint \u2013 Scope 3: Product related Carbon Footprint for Fiscal Year 2021\n\nFraunhofer IZM reviewed Apple\u2019s scope 3 carbon footprint data related to the products manufactured and sold by Apple Inc. in fiscal year 2021.\n\n1 Summary\n\nThis review checks transparency of data and calculations, appropriateness of supporting product related data and assumptions, and overall plausibility of the calculated comprehensive annual carbon footprint comprised of emissions derived from the life cycle assessment (LCA) of Apple products shipped in fiscal year 2021. This review and verification focuses on Scope 3 emissions for products sold by Apple Inc. (as defined by WRI/WBCSD/Greenhouse Gas Protocol \u2013 Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting Standard). It is noted that emissions relating to the facilities that are owned or leased by Apple (scope 1 and 2 emissions) as well as business travel and employee commute were subject to a separate third party verification and are therefore excluded from the scope of this statement. Confidential data relating to product sales and shipments were also excluded from the scope of this verification.\n\nThis review and verification covers Apple\u2019s annual greenhouse gas emissions and does not replace reviews conducted for individual product LCAs for greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). The life cycle emissions data produced by Apple for individual products has been calculated in accordance to the standard ISO 14040/14044: Environmental management \u2013 Life cycle assessment \u2013 Principles and framework / Requirements and guidelines. This review and verification furthermore complies with ISO 14064-3: Greenhouse gases \u2013 Part 3: Specification with guidance for the validation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions.\n\nThe review of the annual carbon footprint has considered the following criteria:\n\n- The system, boundaries and functional unit are clearly defined\n- Assumptions and estimations made are appropriate\n- Selection of primary and secondary data is appropriate and methodologies used are adequately disclosed\n\nThese criteria are also fundamental to the review of LCAs conducted for individual product emissions. The reviewers note that the largest share (99%) of Apple Inc. annual carbon\nfootprint is comprised of scope 3 emissions from individual products. The aforementioned criteria have been regularly reviewed by Fraunhofer IZM since 2007 with a view to providing independent feedback that can facilitate continuous improvement and refinement in the LCA methodology applied by Apple Inc.\n\nData reported by Apple is as follows:\n\n|                | Manufacturing | Transportation | Product Use | Recycling | Corporate |\n|----------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|\n| 2021           | 16.20         | 1.75           | 4.99        | 0.08      | 0.17      |\n| (1)            | [MMT CO\u2082e]    | [MMT CO\u2082e]     | [MMT CO\u2082e]  | [MMT CO\u2082e]| [MMT CO\u2082e]|\n| (2)            |                |                |             |           |           |\n| (3)            |                |                |             |           |           |\n\nMMT CO\u2082e: million metric tons carbon dioxide equivalents\n\n(1): includes CO\u2082e reductions due to Apple\u2019s Clean Energy Program and Renewable Energy Certificates, which are not covered by this verification statement\n\n(2): includes CO\u2082e reductions due to Renewable Energy Certificates, which are not covered by this verification statement\n\n(3): not covered by this verification statement\n\nIncluding a reported value of 0.17 million metric tons CO\u2082e for facilities (out of scope of this verification), total comprehensive carbon footprint is reported to be 23.18 million metric tons CO\u2082e (gross total).\n\nApple\u2019s comprehensive carbon footprint includes an increasing amount of greenhouse gas emissions reductions for manufacturing resulting from Apple renewable energy projects, supplier renewable electricity purchases, and supplier renewable electricity installations. These reductions are part of Apple\u2019s Clean Energy Program. Fraunhofer IZM has not verified these emissions reductions.\n\nBased on the process and procedures conducted, there is no evidence that the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) assertion with regards to scope 3 carbon footprint\n\n- is not materially correct and is not a fair representation of GHG data and information, and\n- has not been prepared in accordance with the related International Standard on GHG quantification, monitoring and reporting.\n\n2 Reviewed Data and Plausibility Check\n\nA verification and sampling plan as required by ISO 14046-3 has been established for the comprehensive carbon footprint review and verification, defining the level of assurance, objectives, criteria, scope and materiality of the verification.\n\nAs part of this review and verification Apple disclosed following data to Fraunhofer IZM:\nSales data for FY2021, including accessories and including AppleCare, Apple\u2019s extended warranty and technical support plans for their devices.\n\nLife cycle GHG emissions for all products, differentiating the actual product configurations (e.g., memory capacity)\n\nCalculation methodology for the comprehensive carbon footprint and methodological changes implemented in 2021\n\nThe total carbon footprint \u2013 scope 3 for the fiscal year 2021\n\nDetailed analysis of the comprehensive carbon footprint including:\n  - The breakdown of the carbon footprint into life cycle phases manufacturing, transportation, product use and recycling\n  - Detailed product specific split into life cycle phases\n  - The contribution of individual products and product families to the overall carbon footprint\n\nThe data and information supporting the GHG assertion were projected (use phase and recycling) and historical (i.e., fiscal year 2021 data regarding sales figures, manufacturing, transportation, use patterns where available).\n\nThis review comprises a check of selected data, which are most influential to the overall carbon footprint. The overall plausibility check addressed the following questions:\n\n- Are product LCAs referenced and updated with more recent data correctly?\n- Are results for products, for which no full LCA review was undertaken, plausible?\n- Are carbon emission data for individual products plausible in the light of methodological changes as indicated by Apple?\n\nThis review was done remotely.\n\n3 Findings\n\nIn FY2021 and beginning of FY2022 14 recent product LCA studies have been reviewed successfully against ISO 14040/44. These LCAs cover product segments iPhone, iPad, MacBook Air, MacBookPro, iMac, and Apple Watch. These recently reviewed LCA studies cover products which represent in total 44.6% of the total scope 3 carbon footprint. Representatives of other product segments iPod, Mac Pro, HomePod, AirPort Express /\nAirPort Extreme, Apple TV, AirPods and Beats products) underwent no or only minor design changes compared to those which went through a full LCA review in former years. All reviewed LCA studies up to now cover in total 67.3% of the total scope 3 carbon footprint.\n\nAll questions raised in the course of the review were answered by Apple and related evidence was provided where needed.\n\n4 Conclusions\n\nApple\u2019s assessment approach is excellent in terms of granularity of the used calculation data. A significant share of components is modelled with accurate primary data from Apple\u2019s suppliers.\n\nFor all product LCA calculations, where exact data was missing, the principle of a worst-case approach has been followed and results have been calculated with rather conservative estimates.\n\nThe review has not found assumptions or calculation errors on the carbon footprint data level that indicate the scope 3 carbon footprint has been materially misstated. The excellent analysis meets the principles of good scientific practice.\n\nBerlin, March 21, 2022\n\n- Karsten Schischke -\nFraunhofer IZM\nDept.

The scope of the plastic packaging footprint includes Apple\u2019s corporate packaging plastic usage from products and retail operations. The packaging plastic footprint tracks the total amount of plastic, adhesives, and ink, that Apple uses in packaging. Apple obtains and analyses supplier-specific data for each product line and sums up these figures for the entire company using sell-in numbers. For some products, a representative supplier is chosen to calculate the product-specific packaging. The output is a total packaging plastic footprint.\n\nThe review of the corporate annual packaging plastic footprint has considered the following criteria:\n\n- The system boundaries are clearly defined\n- Assumptions and estimations made are appropriate\n- Use of supplier data is appropriate and methodologies used are adequately disclosed\n\nData reported by Apple is as follows:\n2021 Total Plastic Packaging Plastic Retail Bags\n\n|                | Plastic | Packaging Plastic | Retail Bags |\n|----------------|---------|-------------------|-------------|\n| Plastic        | 12,700  | 12,500            | 200         |\n| Plastic w/o adhesives | 9,200   | 9,200             | \u2013           |\n\nAll results and figures reviewed for fiscal year 2021 are plausible.\n\n2 Reviewed Data and Findings\n\nAs part of this review Apple disclosed following data to Fraunhofer IZM:\n\n- Calculation methodology for the corporate packaging plastic footprint\n- Sales data for FY2021, including accessories\n- Selected product and supplier specific data on packaging materials and production yields\n- Aggregated packaging plastic data for all products and the total corporate packaging plastic footprint for the fiscal year 2021\n\nThe methodology paper provided by Apple (Packaging Plastic Footprint at Apple \u2013 Methodology Description \u2013 V1.0) in 2018, is considered a sound and appropriate guidance for determining the company packaging plastic. Where appropriate, this approach follows methodological principles applied for state-of-the-art Life Cycle Assessments.\n\nThis review comprises a check of packaging plastic data for selected products (iPhone 13 mini and iPhone 12).\n\nPlausibility of some data has been questioned and discussed with Apple in detail. No corrections were needed.\n\nThis review was done remotely. All questions raised in the course of the review were answered by Apple and related evidence was provided where needed.\nBased on the process and procedures conducted, there is no evidence that the corporate packaging plastic footprint is not materially correct and is not a fair representation of plastic data and information. The excellent analysis meets the principles of good scientific practice.\n\nBerlin, March 24, 2022\n\n- Marina Proske -\nFraunhofer IZM\nDept.

An IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty [Masson-Delmotte, V., P. Zhai, H.-O. P\u00f6rtner, D. Roberts, J. Skea, P.R. Shukla, A. Pirani, W. Moufouma-Okia, C. P\u00e9an, R. Pidcock, S. Connors, J.B.R. Matthews, Y. Chen, X. Zhou, M.I. Gomis, E. Lonnoy, T. Maycock, and T. Waterfield (eds.)]. World Meteorological Organization, Geneva, Switzerland, 32 pp. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has validated the following emissions reduction target for Apple: 61.7 percent by fiscal year 2030 relative to our fiscal year 2019 emissions. This SBTi-validated target is derived from our target to reduce emissions by 75 percent by fiscal year 2030 \u2014 only with a 2019 base year, instead of 2015.\n\n5. The result is a gross footprint of 23.2 million metric tons (after accounting for the additional REC purchase), and a net carbon footprint of 22.5 million metric tons (after accounting for the purchase of carbon offsets).\n\n6. Gross carbon footprint refers to Apple\u2019s carbon footprint before applying carbon offsets. Our net carbon footprint incorporates carbon offsets.\n\n7. Testing conducted by Apple in October 2020 using a preproduction Mac mini with Apple M1 chip, 8GB of memory, 256GB SSD, and LG UltraFine 5K Display, and a shipping Mac mini with a quad-core Intel Core i3 processor, 8GB of memory, 256GB SSD, and LG UltraFine 5K Display. Energy consumption was measured during wireless browsing of top websites.\n\n8. Based on sales-weighted averages of Mac, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, Apple TV, HomePod, AirPods, and Beats.\n\n9. Eligible products are those in a product category for which ENERGY STAR certification exists. For more information, visit www.energystar.gov. ENERGY STAR and the ENERGY STAR mark are registered trademarks owned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n10. Calculated in accordance with the SASB standard, metric TC-HW-410a.2. Apple lists eligible products sold in the United States and Canada on the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) Registry. To calculate this metric, we considered \u201celigible for the EPEAT Registry\u201d all products sold globally that correspond to those listed on the EPEAT Registry. Eligible products are those in a product category for which EPEAT registration exists, which includes desktop computers, notebook computers, computer displays, and mobile phones. For more information, visit www.epeat.net.\n\n11. Testing was conducted by Apple in February 2022 using preproduction Mac Studio systems with Apple M1 Ultra with 20-core CPU and 64-core GPU. Power was measured using a representative workload in a commercial application. High-end PC desktop data comes from testing Alienware Aurora R13 with Core i9-12900KF and GeForce RTX 3090. Performance tests are conducted using specific computer systems and reflect the approximate performance of Mac Studio.\n\n12. Testing conducted by Apple in October 2020 using a preproduction Mac mini with Apple M1 chip, 8GB of memory, 256GB SSD, and LG UltraFine 5K Display, and a shipping Mac mini with a quad-core Intel Core i3 processor, 8GB of memory, 256GB SSD, and LG UltraFine 5K Display. Energy consumption was measured during wireless browsing of top websites.\n\n13. Efficiency performance is based on the U.S. Department of Energy Federal Energy Conservation Standards for Battery Chargers. Energy efficiency terms: The energy efficiency values are based on the following conditions:\n   - Power adapter, no-load: Condition in which the Apple USB Power Adapter with the USB-C to Lightning Cable (1m) is connected to AC power, but not connected to Phone.\n   - Power adapter efficiency: Average of the Apple 20W USB Power Adapter with the USB-C to Lightning Cable (1m) measured efficiency when tested at 100 percent, 75 percent, 50 percent, and 25 percent of the power adapter\u2019s rated output current.\n\n14. While we saw some reductions in energy use resulting from office shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, we also recognize that energy use at our employees\u2019 homes likely increased during this period. We did not build out new methodologies to account for this increased energy use, because it was temporary in nature. We will continue to revisit this into the future.\n\n15. Greenhouse gas reporting is included in Apple\u2019s Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Responsibility Standards.\n\n16. \u201cApple-created project\u201d percentages don\u2019t add up to 100 due to rounding.\n\n17. FY2021 renewable electricity figures associated with Apple\u2019s Supplier Clean Energy Program do not include REC purchases Apple made to address a small increase to its carbon footprint. When accounting for the REC purchases, the total renewable energy online in Apple\u2019s supply chain was 10.6 gigawatt-hours, generating 18.6 million megawatt-hours and avoiding 14.24 million metric tons of carbon emissions.\n\n18. Elysis was used in the production of the 16-inch MacBook Pro that was released in 2019. The 16-inch MacBook Pro released in 2021 now features a 100% recycled aluminum enclosure.\n\n19. Rogelj, J., D.

As of the end of fiscal year 2021, all established sub-assembly/module supplier sites \u2014 or those that have been Apple suppliers for more than one year \u2014 for major components including display, speaker, battery, housing, Taptic Engine, antenna, S/P, band, charger, and packaging are third-party verified as Zero Waste by UL LLC (UL 2799 Standard). Sub-assembly/module suppliers are those that assemble modules prior to final assembly of Apple products. These suppliers are also commonly referred to as Tier 1 suppliers. UL requires at least 90 percent diversion through methods other than waste to energy to achieve Zero Waste to Landfill (Silver 90\u201394 percent, Gold 95\u201399 percent, and Platinum 100 percent) designations.\n\n2. Includes the 13-inch MacBook Air, Apple TV 4K, 13-inch MacBook Pro, Mac mini, iPad mini, 11-inch iPad Pro, iPad, and the 24-inch iMac. Recycled content accounts for materials that are third-party certified and supplier reported. The actual total recycled content may be higher given industry-average recycled content not included here.\n\n3. Total recycled material shipped in products is driven by product material composition and total sales, and may fluctuate based on the number and type of products sold each year.\n\n4. Recycling makes better use of finite resources by sourcing from recovered rather than mined materials. We ask our suppliers to have recycled content verified by an independent third party to a standard that conforms to ISO 14021.\n\n5. We define bio-materials as those that can be regenerated in a human lifespan, like paper fibers or sugarcane. Bio-materials can help us use fewer finite resources. But even though bio-materials have the ability to regrow, they are not always managed responsibly. Renewable materials are a type of bio-material managed in a way that enables continuous production without depleting earth\u2019s resources. That\u2019s why we focus on sources that are certified for their management practices.\n\n6. Compares carbon footprint of aluminum from recycled sources to primary aluminum smelted with electricity generated from coal.\n\n7. This achievement was made in 2022 so is not reflected in the total estimated recycled content, which captures fiscal year 2021 data.\n\n8. This achievement was made in 2022 so is not reflected in the total estimated recycled content, which captures fiscal year 2021 data.\n\n9. Plastic packaging components refer to any packaging part made of majority plastic, including plastic wraps, plastic trays, or plastic screen films. Some plastic is still found on packaging components made primarily of fiber.\n\n10. Refers to retail packaging.\n\n11. Standard applies to retail packaging and shippers, and excludes plastic-based components, wraps, and adhesives.\n\n12. Responsible sourcing of wood fiber is defined in Apple\u2019s Sustainable Fiber Specification (PDF).\n\n13. Based on expected equivalent fiber production from our forestry projects and virgin fiber used for Apple product packaging. To determine the output of Apple\u2019s projects, we work with our partners to understand the productive potential of these working forests. The forest management plans required to achieve or maintain certification limit harvest volumes to sustainable levels. We use these potential harvest volumes to estimate the sustainable productive capacity of these forests.\n\n14. Turner, Ash, \u201c2020\u20132021\u2019s Phone Depreciation Report,\u201d BankMyCell.\n\n15. This applies specifically to our U.S.-based Trade In program.\n\n16. Owners of iPhone, iPad, iPod, Mac, or Apple TV products may obtain service and parts from Apple service providers, including Apple Retail Stores and Independent Repair Providers, for a minimum of 5 years from when Apple last distributed the product for sale. Service and parts may be obtained for longer, as required by law or for up to 7 years, subject to parts availability. Additionally, Mac notebooks may be eligible for an extended battery-only repair period for up to 10 years from when the product was last distributed for sale, subject to parts availability.\n\n17. Refurbished products are not available in all countries.\n\n18. Estimated based on rock-to-metal ratios from USGS \u2014 a change from our previous report, which used ore-to-metal ratios \u2014 and on recovery rates from iPhone main logic boards and flexes.\n\n19. Apple is willing to license five patents relating to Daisy and certain other associated IP on reasonable, royalty-free terms.\n\n20. Estimated based on rock-to-metal ratios from USGS \u2014 a change from our previous report, which used ore-to-metal ratios \u2014 and on recovery rates from iPhone main logic boards and flexes.\n\n21.

The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal.\n\n23. Compares carbon footprint of aluminum from recycled sources to primary aluminum smelted with electricity generated from coal.\n\n24. We define high risk as those areas with high or extremely high overall water risk based on the WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool.\n\n25. These savings do not include reduction in water use from facility closures and reduced occupancy due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We consider those savings temporary and also acknowledge that the water use was transferred to employees\u2019 homes.\n\n26. We are now accounting for savings through this program on a fiscal year basis, rather than a calendar year basis as was reported in previous years.\n27. This total includes freshwater use as well as alternative water sources including recycled water, rainwater, and recovered condensate. We define freshwater as drinking-water quality, the majority of which comes from municipal sources and less than 5 percent comes from onsite groundwater sources. Recycled water represents a key alternative water source. Our recycled water is sourced primarily from municipal treatment plants, with less than 5 percent from onsite treatment. Recycled water is primarily used for irrigation, make-up water in cooling, or toilet flushing. Other alternative sources of freshwater include rainwater and recovered condensate that is captured onsite. Water used for construction for activities like dust control is not included in this total, and represents 13 million gallons of water used in fiscal year 2021. Our actual water discharge may vary by 10 percent relative to our estimates. In these estimates, we\u2019ve taken into account consumptive activities including irrigation and cooling towers.\n\n28. We calculate water discharge based on known evaporation, from activities like cooling and irrigation. For sites where these evaporative activities are not present we estimate that water withdrawn is returned to municipal systems. We estimate our margin of error to be approximately 10 percent, and will continue to update our model with new sources of data.\n\n29. Includes total water stored within aquifer for use by multiple different parties contributing to the project.\n\n30. Waste diversion rates do not include construction and demolition waste or electronic waste for fiscal year 2020. Electronic waste is accounted for in the total metric tons of electronic waste we sent to recycling found on page 49.\n\n31. Our Mesa and Prineville data centers are third-party certified as Zero Waste by USGBC TRUE. TRUE requires 90 percent diversion or higher from the landfill without the use of waste-to-energy to achieve Zero Waste to Landfill.\n\n32. This waste-to-energy option is not yet available to sites in Alaska and Hawaii.\n\n33. These sites have been third-party verified by UL LLC against the UL 2799 Standard. UL requires at least 90 percent diversion through methods other than waste to energy to achieve Zero Waste to Landfill (Silver 90\u201394 percent, Gold 95\u201399 percent, and Platinum 100 percent) designations.\n\n34. All established final assembly supplier sites \u2014 or those that have been Apple suppliers for more than one year \u2014 for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, AirPods, iHomePod, Apple TV, and Beats are third-party verified as Zero Waste by UL LLC (UL 2799 Standard).
