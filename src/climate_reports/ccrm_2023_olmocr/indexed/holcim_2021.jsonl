This placed sustainability at the core of our business with ambitious targets in our pillars.\n\nWe have continued our industry leadership in climate by being one of the first seven companies in the world to have science-based targets in biodiversity and the first in the industry not only in biodiversity but also in water with replenishing targets in water risk areas and process reduction targets in all segments!\n\nJan Jenisch passed a strong message to all our stakeholders by launching our new Human Rights and Social Policy. All our countries now have human rights assessments and action plans in place. We also made a strong commitment to contribute to positive social impact by 2030.\n\nThe Circular Explorer was launched with Bertrand Piccard and is now sailing to collect over 4 tons of waste per day from waterways. She is fully solar powered and will serve as a science lab and education medium on water and ecosystem protection.\n\nStriatus, our 3D-printed bridge, establishes a new language for concrete and what is possible in sustainable construction; it is digital, environmentally advanced and circular by design. Assembled without any reinforcement and adhesive, it was recognized with the Design Innovation award by the European Cultural Centre in Venice, where you can still see it today.\n\nIn Innovation we launched DynaMax, the ultimate performance concrete, with high strength, outstanding durability and superior rigidity, alongside SmartBlends, Internal Curing and I-Concrete. ECOPact, the industry\u2019s broadest range of green concrete, has been launched globally at speed and is now offered in 24 markets and all regions of the world. ECOPlanet, our global range of green cement, delivering at least 30% lower carbon footprint with equal to superior performance, was launched in 2021 and is now available in 15 markets.\n\nQ YOU CONTINUE TO LEAD THE INDUSTRY IN TERMS OF SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY AND TARGETS; ARE YOU CONFIDENT YOU CAN ACHIEVE YOUR LONG-TERM CO2 TARGETS?\nA Holcim maintained its focus on CO2 emission reduction in 2021. Our efforts in the use of industrial mineral components helped to lower Holcim\u2019s clinker factor, dropping to 70.1%. Our use of alternative fuels and raw materials was particularly strong and increased over-proportionally to...\ncement volumes with alternative raw materials volumes up almost 50% and Europe leading the way. As a result, direct CO2 emissions (Scope 1) of 553 kg CO2 net per ton of cementitious materials represented a decrease by 1% like for like versus the prior year.\n\nWhile this is in line with the yearly efforts planned to reach our 2022 target of 550 kg CO2 net per ton, we acknowledge we must accelerate our CO2 reductions in the coming years. For that reason, in 2021 Holcim invested over CHF 200 million in CO2-related projects. We expect to see the full benefit of these investments during 2022, to accelerate CO2 reductions in line with our 2025 and 2030 targets.\n\nQ CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND THE RECYCLING OF WASTE PLAY A KEY ROLE IN YOUR CO2 PERFORMANCE; WERE THE 2021 RESULTS CONSISTENT?\n\nA As you say, circular economy plays a key role in our CO2 performance and has been a highlight this year with our waste volumes used in cement production growing twice as fast as cement production itself, with waste used increasing 20% to 46 million tons, and waste used including ready mix and aggregates increasing to 54 million tons. Our circularity ratio for cement increased to 24% and we made great progress toward our 2030 target of 30%. For the first time we have disclosed the volumes of construction and demolition waste (CDW) used in our business; this has shown great progress to 6.6 million tons, highlighting this business as a growth segment towards \u201cStrategy 2025 \u2013 Accelerating Green Growth.\u201d 2021 performance really shows that circularity is the opportunity of our time and circular construction is being enabled by Holcim today.\n\nQ YOUR IMPROVEMENT IN HEALTH AND SAFETY SINCE 2016 IS OUTSTANDING; IS YOUR FOCUS AS STRONG AS EVER?\n\nA Our fatalities reduced further again this year and since we launched Ambition \u201c0\u201d in 2017, we have reduced fatalities sevenfold in five years. Every fatality is a tragedy and our focus is as sharp as ever if not more so to reach Ambition \u201c0\u201d. Our Lost Time Incident Frequency Rate (LTIFR) reached world-class levels of 0.39, over 20% down vs 2020, with over 95% of our sites reporting zero lost time incidents. Although we won\u2019t be satisfied until we reach zero harm, we are pleased to report our Ambition \u201c0\u201d strategy is working and producing world-class results. In 2021, our work with road safety was recognized with the Prince Michael International Road Safety Award in the category of Fleet Safety.\n\nQ WHAT INNOVATIONS ARE YOU MOST EXCITED ABOUT, AND CAN WE EXPECT BIG THINGS IN 2022?\n\nA My role expanded earlier this year to combine both Sustainability and Innovation, and with the launch of \u201cStrategy 2025 \u2013 Accelerating Green Growth,\u201d Holcim placed sustainability at the core of our business, so innovation is key. We are exploring disruptive technologies and solutions that will change the way we build, like 3D printing. Our digital materials platform ORIS was spun off as a separate entity to fast-track its approach to building more with less and to become an influential voice in changing the business model of road-building to be more sustainable. A total of 19 of our green building solutions have been recognized by the Solar Impulse Foundation, who champion the most innovative technologies that protect the environment in a financially positive way. We are continuing to work on a number of projects and I am looking forward to announcing them in 2022.

Our efforts in the use of clean electrical energy helped decrease indirect emissions (Scope 2) to 34 kg net CO\u2082/ton. Scope 3 emissions intensity showed good progress and reductions in the categories of fuels and purchased clinker and cement. In absolute terms our Scope 3 emissions totalled 30 million tons. These emission reductions show continued progress toward our net-zero ambition.\n\nFor Holcim, nature encompasses two main elements: water and biodiversity. In 2021 we made great progress toward strategic targets for water, reducing freshwater withdrawal in cement to 259 liters/ton and for the first time disclosing specific freshwater withdrawal for both aggregates and ready mix businesses. Our nature strategy placed us among the first 1% of the 500 largest global companies with science-driven biodiversity targets and made us the first in our industry with a freshwater replenishment commitment. At the end of 2021, over 93% of our quarries have Rehabilitation Plans and Biodiversity Management Plans (for those of high biodiversity importance) in place, putting us well on track to meet our 2022 targets.\n\nWe are committed to respect human rights and to empower people and communities to build a better future. In 2021, we committed to contributing CHF 500 million to create positive social impact cumulatively by 2030. During the year, we invested CHF 43 million on housing and infrastructure, health, education and skills, showing an increase of 19% from the prior year. COVID-19 was still present and our teams continued to implement an extraordinary range of measures at country level. Putting our commitment into practice, 100% of our operating countries now have a human rights assessment process and action plan in place.\nREPORTING ON TARGET AREAS\n\nPERFORMANCE DATA TABLES\n## PERFORMANCE DATA TABLES\n\n### CO\u2082 and energy\n\n| Unit key | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2025 target | 2030 target | GRI ref | SASB ref |\n|----------|------|------|------|-------------|-------------|---------|----------|\n| Mt \u2013 million tons | kgCO\u2082/t | 561 | 555 | 553 | 520 | 475 | 305-1 EM-CM-110a.1 |\n| M GJ \u2013 million gigajoules | kgCO\u2082/t | 564 | 557 | 553 | | | |\n| MJ \u2013 million joules | kgCO\u2082/t | NR | NR | 581 | | | |\n| Mm\u00b3 \u2013 million cubic meters | kgCO\u2082/t | 37 | 36 | 34 | 13 | 305-2 |\n| CHF \u2013 Swiss Francs | kgCO\u2082/t | 38 | 37 | 34 | | | |\n| NR \u2013 Not reported | kgCO\u2082/t | | | | | | |\n| L/m\u00b3 \u2013 Liters per cubic meter | kgCO\u2082/t | | | | | | |\n\n**Notes**\n\n1.

We had previously aligned with our then SBTi-aligned 2030 target of 520 kg net CO2/t.cem. In 2020, we changed this to a 30% threshold related to local market baselines in line with our criteria for EcoLabels.\nConsolidation rules for non-financial KPIs\n\n**SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION**\nAligning with Group financial reporting our consolidation scope includes the entities covered in the Group consolidated financial statements. The list of principal consolidated companies is presented in the Holcim Integrated Annual Report, 2021.\n\n**CHANGES IN SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION**\nIn the 2021 Sustainability Performance Report, the most significant change in consolidation is the divestments of operations in Zambia, Malawi, Indian Ocean and the acquisition of a controlling interest in the United Arab Emirates. Key metrics have been shown \u201cas published in the reporting year\u201d and \u201cunder the 2021 consolidation scope\u201d in separate lines. Unless stated otherwise, all prior year figures for other indicators are \u201cas published in the reporting year.\u201d\n\n**DIVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS**\nFor business(es) divested during the year, data are excluded for the entire year. For business(es) acquired during the year, data are included for the entire year.\n\nWhen a new site or sites are acquired by Holcim, its procedures and definitions for non-financial data might not be necessarily in line with Holcim standards. Accordingly, we give the new site time to meet our standards and report performance according to Holcim standards. This should not be later than the second year after acquisition. Accordingly, the acquisition of Firestone Building Products has only been included in the following data sets:\n\n- Employees by employment contract and age interval\n- Employee Gender Diversity\n- Employee Turnover\n- Health and Safety.\n\n**DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING METHODOLOGIES**\n\n**EXTRAPOLATION**\nSince 2019, Holcim reporting is based on 11 months of data (as at 30 November) which are extrapolated to the annual estimated values. The objective is to accelerate the reporting process to align with the financial reporting timeline.\n\n- For environmental data, the full-year production, taken from consolidation system (SAP), is used to extrapolate energy consumption, CO2 emissions, air emissions, water, materials and waste-derived resources. As we are using full-year actual data from SAP, full-year estimate indicators are not collected anymore. All other indicators, such as environmental certifications, hectares rehabilitated and internal waste managed were not extrapolated as they are not necessarily linear.\n- For Human resources, only hours of training per employee have been extrapolated\n- For Sustainable solutions, data are collected for the full year\n- For Health and Safety, data are reported for the full year\n- For Human rights and Stakeholder, data are reported for the full year.\n\n**CONTROLS**\nControls put in place to ensure data quality and robustness include:\n\n- The Axiom digital reporting and analytics platform as well as internally developed proprietary spreadsheet based import templates used in 2021, all included built-in validation rules to ensure robustness of data reported. This includes highlighting when a value is out of an expected range or shows a significant deviation from previously reported data, and requires an explanatory comment.\n- A robust workflow process is in place requiring a validation of the data and explanations by two managers for each questionnaire.\n- Validation dashboards have been developed to allow entities and subject matter experts to identify values that are out of range.\n- Data (such as production, spend on social initiatives and number of employees) are checked against other reporting streams such as SAP and technical reports and for consistency.\n\n**ECONOMIC INDICATORS**\nIn 2021, Data on net sales of sustainable solutions were collected through SAP financial reporting process, complemented with a country specific survey for sales associated with affordable housing and water, not yet transitioned to SAP. To strengthen the robustness of our reporting we have engaged SGS (a world leading certification company) to validate that our green brands and ecolabels meet the ISO 14021 standard for Environmental Labels from 2022.\n\n- Data on supplier assessments were collected through proprietary spreadsheet based import questionnaire templates and respective protocol \u2013 the Holcim Sustainable Procurement Questionnaire. Data are gathered at Country/Group Reporting Unit level and cover all business segments and their industrial production sites. The Sustainable Procurement Questionnaire was conducted covering 58 entities representing more than 98% of our total procurement spend.\n\n**ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS**\nEnvironmental performance indicators follow the reporting guidelines of the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA) (previously the World Business Council for Sustainable\nDevelopment - Cement Sustainability Initiative (WBCSD-CSI).\n\nIn 2021, environmental data were collected through the Axiom digital reporting and analytics tool as well as proprietary spreadsheet based import templates as we are transitioning to Holcim\u2019s reporting system iCare now hosted by a new provider. Reporting guidelines for Environmental reporting were issued to ensure proper reporting, highlighting new and updated environmental indicators as well as change in reporting scope as needed.\n\nAll sites that were active during the reporting year have been considered eligible to be included under the environmental reporting. For sites that were active less than six months, their impact has been estimated based on their production and the Group averages.\n\nFor environmental data, cement terminals are not considered material, and therefore can be excluded from the consolidation.\n\n- **Scope 1, Scope 2 and energy:** We use the GCCA Sustainability Guidelines for the monitoring and reporting of CO\u2082 emissions from cement manufacturing (previously WBCSD-CSI Cement CO\u2082 and Energy Protocol version 3.1) to calculate CO\u2082 emissions between the 1990 baseline and the reporting year. To calculate Scope 2 emissions we align with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. Extensive work on ascertaining the most accurate available emissions factors is continually being conducted. Emissions from Captive Power Plants are included in the performance data table under \u201cOther segments: CO\u2082 emissions from fuels.\u201d The reporting coverage of the CO\u2082 data is 100%. For data not reported in 2021, the last available measurement or the Group average has been used to estimate the 2021 performance. The coverage of energy data per segment is 100%. Default CO\u2082 emissions factors for fuels are taken from the GCCA Sustainability Guidelines. Operations can overwrite these default values if more precise values or measurements are available.\n\n- **Scope 3 emissions:** In 2020, we developed a more comprehensive and rigorous approach to measure the CO\u2082 emissions from our supply chain. The methodology is aligned with GHG and GCCA protocols. In 2021 we further improved accuracy by automating data capture \u2013 for example through our Transport Analytic Centre (TAC) digital solution, which captures CO\u2082 emissions from every single downstream road transport trip. The TAC covers our operations in 55 countries, monitoring around 90,000 trucks and 1.7 billion kms travelled across all our business segments. For indirect emissions of electricity purchased we are currently accounting for the upstream emissions of the generation companies and the transmission and distribution losses, based on emission factors of the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). We are working on collecting more accurate emission factors to further increase accuracy of our reporting in future reporting cycles.\n\n- **Emissions:** We use the GCCA Sustainability Guidelines for the monitoring and reporting of emissions from cement manufacturing (previously WBCSD-CSI Guidelines for Emissions Monitoring and Reporting in the Cement Industry Protocol (2012)). Emission levels can be measured continuously or based on spot measurement. Information is always available at kiln level. If an emission component has not been measured in 2021 due to travel restrictions or other, the 2020 measurement has been used to estimate the 2020 performance at kiln level. If no measurement was available in 2020, the Group average has been used to estimate the Group absolute impact.\n\n- **Percentage of production with measurement:** The full production from a kiln is included in this coverage only when the emission of the respective pollutant(s) is/are monitored, otherwise the production contribution from the kiln is considered zero. For the percentage of production with comprehensive emission monitoring, the full production from a kiln is included only when emissions of all pollutants (dust, NOx, SO\u2082, VOC/THC, heavy metals (Hg, Cd, Ti, Sb, As, Pb, Cr, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni and V), PCDD/F) are monitored.\n\n- **Water:** The GCCA Sustainability Guidelines for the monitoring and reporting of water in cement manufacturing (previously the CSI Protocol for Water Reporting) has been used as a reference to measure the water performance of the Group. Data from captive power plants are reported separately. The coverage of water data in on average at 98%.\n\n- **Waste and recycling:** Waste comprises all forms of solid or liquid waste (excluding wastewater) and are defined as hazardous or non-hazardous based on the legislation of the country in which the site operates. Overburden has been excluded from non-hazardous wastes disposed of on site. Data from captive power plants is reported separately.\n\n- **Waste-derived resources:** Data reported for waste-derived resources includes alternative raw materials, industrial mineral components (consumed and sold externally), alternative fuels, volume of return concrete recycled, secondary and/or recycled aggregates and recycled asphalt. In 2021, we introduced a new indicator for a waste stream in the cement segment, which contributed to 1.7% of the total waste-derived resources figure reported.\n\n- **Biodiversity and quarries:** The number of quarries that have rehabilitation plans in place are aligned with the Holcim Directive on Quarry Rehabilitation and Biodiversity. The key requirements go far beyond legal compliance and includes measures respecting the mitigation hierarchy (avoid, minimize, restore and offset) and a biodiversity management plan for sites assessed as of high biodiversity value.\n\n**HEALTH AND SAFETY (H&S)**\n\nH&S performance indicators follow the GCCA Sustainability Guidelines for the monitoring and reporting of safety in cement manufacturing, issued February 2020. These guidelines stipulate that road fatalities involving contractors \u201coff company premises and not branded or regular\u201d should be excluded. A regular contract is defined...\nas \u201clonger than 30 days continuously or collectively on a rolling 12-month period.\u201d To provide clarity on fatalities data, the notion of control management has been added, allowing to better capture road fatalities impact.\n\nH&S data are gathered at site level and further consolidated at Country/Group Reporting Unit level and covers all business segments and their industrial production sites, including Corporate and above country regional and service entities.\n\nIn 2021, H&S data were collected through Holcim\u2019s reporting system \u2013 iCare | HSE Incident management module.\n\nData are segregated according to onsite and offsite incidents, and cover employees, contractors and third parties. The hours worked used to calculate incident rates for employees and contractors are calculated and/or estimated locally by business units.\n\nSOCIAL INDICATORS\nIn 2021, Social data were collected through the Holcim\u2019s reporting system and respective protocol \u2013 the annual social questionnaire.\n\nData are gathered at Country/Group Reporting Unit level and covers all business segments and their industrial production sites, including Corporate and above country regional and service entities.\n\nThe 2021 Social data are derived from a survey covering 54 entities representing 93% of the total Group workforce and include majority owned entities and managed assets. Among other aspects, the entities\u2019 implementation of the human rights approach, human rights assessment and action plans, stakeholder engagement activities and community engagement structures, specific impact indicators of social initiatives, volunteering activities, political donations and subsidies.\n\nIn 2021, Holcim announced its 2030 people strategy to continue contributing to positive social impact and uplifting the wellbeing of communities worldwide. The strategy focuses on three pillars: bridging the world\u2019s housing and infrastructure gap, improving livelihoods and upholding the highest standards of human rights. In 2021, we also launched our new Human Rights and Social Policy. We committed to contributing CHF 500 million to create positive social impact by 2030. To support the implementation of the strategy, we changed our main KPI from beneficiaries to monetary contribution to social initiatives.\n\nThe total contribution to create positive social impact is a cumulative KPI from 2021 to 2030. In 2021 it is calculated by including the total spend on the social initiatives made by Holcim to implement projects and donations. It also includes third party contributions, which are the resources received through external partnerships to implement social initiatives led by Holcim in the countries.\n\nHolcim differentiates four categories for the Social Initiatives, which are:\n\n- **Housing and infrastructure:** initiatives that facilitate access to housing and infrastructure for the community such as affordable housing solutions, building or improving community facilities (hospitals, schools, parks, etc), rural roads, etc.\n- **Health:** COVID-19 support provided for communities, health awareness campaigns, vaccinations programs, general healthcare service provided to the community.\n- **Education and skills:** road safety, lectures in partnership with schools and universities, livelihood and income generation programs, professional training targeting the community.\n- **Other:** Environment management and awareness, cultural, recreational or other initiatives to contribute to positive social impact.\n\nA direct beneficiary is defined as a person who was directly involved in the project or benefited from its implementation. Regarding the calculation of the number of beneficiaries, in 2020 the Beneficiaries Protocol was significantly strengthened, providing a clear guidance on how to count and report the beneficiaries, ensuring consistency across the country\u2019s reports. Whenever possible, we count the exact number of beneficiaries (number of community members trained). When precise measurement is not possible (e.g. beneficiaries of a new hospital or bridge built by Holcim), estimates are made based on scientific methods such as social research, expert interviews or the like. Furthermore, if estimates need to be made, a standard and conservative assumption is being used, with a maximum of 30% of the potential beneficiaries being considered. The type and extent of benefit varies significantly depending on the project.\n\nUnder Human Rights and Stakeholder Engagement, data such as number of community advisory panels, number of engagements with key stakeholders at site level, and complaints related to human rights, environmental impact and other potential topics are recorded. Furthermore, any conflicts with stakeholders they may have or expect in the future and how such conflicts are addressed is captured. Also, countries report on the latest version of their human rights assessment and the status of implementation of their human rights action plan.\n\nREPORTING CYCLE\nThe Holcim Group will continue to report annually.\nASSURANCE STATEMENT\n\nIndependent assurance report on a selection of non-financial information\n\nTO THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE,\nFurther to the request made by the entity Holcim (hereafter \u201cEntity\u201d), and in our quality as an independent verifier, we present our report on a selection of non-financial information established for the year ended on December 31, 2021, presented in the Sustainability Performance Report, consisting in selected consolidated environmental, communities, and health & safety indicators (\u201cthe Sustainability Indicators\u201d) and other non-financial reporting processes (\u201cthe Non-Financial Reporting Processes\u201d) listed in Appendix 1.\n\nTHE ENTITY\u2019S RESPONSIBILITY\nIt is the responsibility of the Entity to prepare the Sustainability Indicators and to implement the Non-Financial Reporting Processes in accordance with the protocols used by the Entity.\n\nINDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY CONTROL\nOur independence is defined by the French Code of Ethics (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) of our profession. In addition, we have implemented a quality control system, including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical standards, professional standards and applicable laws and regulations.\n\nRESPONSIBILITY OF THE INDEPENDENT VERIFIER\nIt is our role, in response to the Entity\u2019s request, based on our work, to:\n\n- attest that the Non-Financial Reporting Processes were implemented as described in the \u201cMethodology and consolidation\u201d section and in accordance with the 2021 Entity Human Resources and Human Rights and Stakeholders Engagement questionnaires and definitions\n- express a limited assurance conclusion that the Sustainability Indicators have been prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the reporting criteria applicable in 2021 (the \u201cReporting Criteria\u201d), consisting in external standards elaborated by the Global Cement and Concrete Association (previously the World Business Council for Sustainable Development \u2013 Cement Sustainability Initiative (WBCSD-CSI)) completed with Entity-specific procedures, a summary of which is provided in the \u201cMethodology and consolidation\u201d section.\n\n1. REVIEW OF THE NON-FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESSES\nWe undertook interviews with the people responsible for the collection and preparation of the information at the headquarters level and at the country level for a selection of entities, in order to:\n\n- assess the suitability of the questionnaires and definitions used in the surveys, in relation to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and understandability\n- verify the implementation of the process for the collection and compilation of the information.\n\nBased on this work, we confirm that we have no comment on the fact that the Non-Financial Reporting Processes were implemented as described in the \u201cMethodology and consolidation\u201d section and in accordance with the 2021 Entity Human Resources and Human Rights and Stakeholders questionnaires and definitions.\n\n2. LIMITED ASSURANCE ON A SELECTION OF SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS\nWe conducted the work described below in accordance with the international standard ISAE 3000 (International Standard on Assurance Engagements).\nNATURE AND SCOPE OF THE WORK\nWe undertook interviews with people responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Indicators in the Sustainable Development and Health & Safety Departments, in charge of the data collection process and, when applicable, the people responsible for internal control processes and risk management, in order to:\n\n- assess the suitability of the Reporting Criteria for reporting, in relation to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and understandability, taking into consideration, if relevant, the best practices of the industry\n- verify the implementation of the process for the collection, compilation, processing and control for completeness and consistency of the Sustainability Indicators and identify the procedures for internal control and risk management related to the preparation of the Sustainability Indicators.\n\nWe determined the nature and extent of our tests and inspections based on the nature and importance of the Sustainability Indicators, in relation to the characteristics of the Entity, its social and environmental issues, its strategy in relation to sustainable development and industry best practices:\n\n- At the Entity level, we consulted documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (organization, policies, actions, etc), implemented analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified, on a test basis, the calculations and the compilation of the information, and also verified their coherence and consistency with the other information presented in the Sustainability Performance Report.\n- At the level of the representative selection of sites and entities that we selected, based on their activity, their contribution to the consolidated indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we undertook interviews to verify the correct application of the procedures and undertook detailed tests on the basis of samples, consisting in verifying the calculations made and linking them with supporting documentation. The sample selected therefore represented on average 18% of the hours worked used for the calculation of safety indicators, and between 11% and 79% of the environmental information.\n\nWe consider that the work we have done by exercising our professional judgment allows us to express a limited assurance conclusion; an assurance of a higher level would have required more extensive verification work.\n\nDue to the necessary use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent in the functioning of any information and internal control system, the risk of non-detection of a significant anomaly in the Sustainability Indicators cannot be entirely eliminated.\n\nCONCLUSION\nBased on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Sustainability Indicators, taken as a whole, have not been fairly presented, in compliance with the Reporting Criteria.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, February 24, 2022\n\n1 ISAE 3000: \u201cAssurance Engagements other than audits or reviews of historical information,\u201d International Federation of Accountants.\n2 Four cement plants: CMU Bhatapara (India), Villaluenga (Spain), Siggenthal (Switzerland) and Alpena (USA), two captive power plants: Bhatapara (India) and Alpena (USA), and four Group Reporting Units (GRUs): Ambuja Cements (India), Spain, Switzerland and USA.\n3 On average 11% of production (cement (25%), aggregates (2%), RMX (6%)), 26% of cement net CO2 emissions (Scope 1), 26% of absolute gross Scope 1 emissions, 23% of absolute Scope 2 emissions, 28% of waste-derived resources, 16% of air emissions, 24% of energy consumption and 79% of cement freshwater withdrawal.\nAPPENDIX 1: SELECTION OF NON-FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\nTHE SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS\n\nProducts and solutions\n- Total raw material consumption \u2013 all segments\n- Clinker produced\n- Cement produced\n- Cementitious materials produced\n- Aggregates produced\n- RMX produced\n- Clinker factor (average % of clinker in cements)\n\nRecycling and waste\n- Waste-derived resources \u2013 all segments\n\nCO\u2082 and energy\n- CEM-specific CO\u2082 emissions \u2013 net (Scope 1)\n- CEM-specific CO\u2082 emissions \u2013 electricity (Scope 2)\n- CEM CO\u2082 emissions \u2013 gross (Scope 1)\n- CEM CO\u2082 emissions \u2013 net (Scope 1)\n- Absolute gross emissions (Scope 1)\n- Absolute emissions (Scope 2)\n- Absolute emissions (Scope 3)\n- CEM energy consumption total\n- Other segments thermal energy\n- Other segments electrical energy\n\nWater\n- CEM-specific freshwater withdrawal (L/ton of cementitious)\n- Aggregates-specific freshwater withdrawal (L/ton of aggregates)\n- RMX-specific freshwater withdrawal (L/ton of RMX)\n- Total water withdrawal \u2013 all segments\n\nEnvironmental management systems\n- Cement sites with an ISO 14001 certification\n\nBiodiversity\n- Quarries with Rehabilitation Plans in place\n- Quarries with biodiversity importance with Biodiversity Management Plans in place\n\nAir emissions\n- % clinker produced with continuous monitoring of dust, NO\u2093 and SO\u2082 emissions\n- % clinker produced with monitoring of dust, NO\u2093 and SO\u2082 emissions\n- Total emissions: dust, NO\u2093, SO\u2082, VOC, mercury, dioxins/furans\n- Specific emissions: dust, NO\u2093, SO\u2082, VOC, mercury, dioxins/furans\n\nCommunities\n- Total contribution to create positive social impact\n\nHealth and safety\n- Fatalities (employees and contractors)\n- Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (employees and contractors)\n- Total Injury Frequency Rate (employees and contractors)\n\nTHE NON-FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESSES\n\nReporting processes covering:\n- Human Resources-related information, including Group employees per employment contract and age interval, gender diversity, turnover, development and social dialogue\n- Human Rights and Stakeholder-related information, including number of beneficiaries and human rights assessments\nOur sustainability reporting is aligned with the GRI Standard and to complement the disclosures we have published supplementary documents on our website.\n\nWith the disclosures in the Annual Integrated Report 2021, Sustainability Performance Report 2021 and related documents on our website, the level of disclosure on GRI standard disclosures and indicators is compatible with a comprehensive \u201cIn accordance\u201d option.

SASB Standards identify the subset of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues most relevant to financial performance in 77 industries. The SASB Standards focus on financially material issues because their mission is to help businesses around the world report on the sustainability topics that matter most to their investors.\n\nAlthough there is much ESG and sustainability information disclosed publicly, often it can be difficult to identify and assess which information is most useful for making finance-related decisions. SASB identifies financially material issues, which are the issues that are reasonably likely to impact the financial condition or operating performance of a company and therefore are most important to investors. The material issues identified by SASB for the construction materials sector are:\n\n- GHG emissions\n- Air quality\n- Energy management\n- Water and wastewater management\n- Waste and hazardous materials management\n- Ecological impacts\n- Employee health and safety\n- Product design and life cycle management\n- Competitive behavior\n\n- **AIR:** Annual Integrated Report 2021\n- **SPR:** Sustainability Performance Report 2021\n- **Web:** [www.holcim.com](http://www.holcim.com)\n### SASB INDEX\n\n| SASB ref | Description | AIR | SPR | Web | Page, comment, performance |\n|----------|-------------|-----|-----|-----|---------------------------|\n| **Greenhouse gas emissions** | | | | | |\n| EM-CM-110a.1 | Gross global Scope 1 emissions, percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations | X | | | We report this in our annual disclosure to the CDP.
