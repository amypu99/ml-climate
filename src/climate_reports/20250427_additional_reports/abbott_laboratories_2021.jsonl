That\u2019s because we\u2019ve long understood that the key to sustaining our enterprise is a willingness to evolve it, to anticipate changes in the environment and to adapt Abbott in ways that make us best able to achieve our fundamental purpose \u2014 helping people live healthier, fuller lives.\n\nWe\u2019ve amply demonstrated that ability throughout our history, strategically reshaping Abbott to become one of the world\u2019s leading health technology companies, with a broad portfolio and global reach that let us help more people than ever before.\n\nThe past few years have been among the most challenging in our lifetimes, but they\u2019ve also highlighted for us the critical nature of the work we do and the significant positive impact we can have for patients and for the communities in which we operate.\n\nBut we know that if we want to sustain that impact in a changing world, we can\u2019t rely on the same playbooks we\u2019ve used before. So, incorporating input from internal and external stakeholders, we developed a 10-year plan to identify the areas we need to focus on in order to grow sustainably.\n\nCentral to this plan is the idea that we can do the most good by pursuing our fundamental mission as a company: bringing life-changing technologies and products to the people and places that need them. That\u2019s why we\u2019re building affordability into our products to increase access to them, and breaking down barriers that prevent people from getting the care they need. And to support that core purpose, we\u2019ve set ourselves ambitious goals in key areas that strengthen our foundation for the future, including building the workforce of tomorrow, responsibly applying data to advance care, building a more resilient, diverse and responsible supply chain, and protecting health by safeguarding the environment.\n\nThis report is the first to detail the progress we\u2019ve made on these 2030 goals and, as you\u2019ll read, we\u2019re making real strides in all of these areas. We\u2019re setting the foundation for our long-term success, but we\u2019re also remaining responsive to the pressing issues of today.\n\nFor example, our contributions to the fight against COVID-19 remained important and impactful (see page 6). We also stepped up in a variety of ways in response to the crisis in Ukraine, donating $6 million in funding and much-needed products to rebuild critical healthcare infrastructure and deliver emergency and primary healthcare services and supplies, working with humanitarian organizations including International Medical Corps, Americares, CARE and Project HOPE.\n\nThe values that drove those actions were also in evidence in our decision, in 2022, to recall infant formula produced at one of our U.S. plants (see page 60). Our people are committed to our Customer Pledge to make our products as if they\u2019re for our own families; and we\u2019ll be redoubling our efforts \u2013 across every business, across every part of the globe \u2013 to ensure that our long-established reputation for excellence and the highest product quality will remain our bedrock.\n\nAt Abbott, we\u2019re in the business of making people\u2019s lives better, and we manage all aspects of the company to ensure we\u2019ll be doing that for decades to come. Our fundamental goal is simple: we are working for a world with fewer barriers \u2014 one that enables people to live their fullest possible lives \u2014 creating healthier people, healthier communities and a healthier world.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRobert B. Ford\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\nIn 2021, Abbott employed a multifaceted approach to achieving our central purpose \u2014 helping people live their best possible lives through better health.\n\n**DELIVERING CONNECTED CARE**\n\nOur NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic keeps patients with chronic pain or movement disorders and their doctors connected with remote monitoring tools and in-app video chats \u2014 something *TIME* magazine recognized the value of when it named NeuroSphere as one of 2021\u2019s best inventions.\n\n**ENHANCING PROCEDURE VISUALIZATION**\n\nWe rolled out our Ultron 1.0 software, bringing enhanced visualization to minimally invasive coronary procedures.\n\n**WEARABLE BIOSENSORS**\n\nIn January 2022, we announced that we\u2019re developing Lingo \u2014 a new category of consumer biowearables designed to translate your body\u2019s unique language. Introduced during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) keynote speech, Lingo biowearables are being designed to track key biomarkers, like glucose, ketones, lactate and alcohol, and deliver actionable data and personalized insights straight to users\u2019 phones.\n\n**RAPID TEST FOR CONCUSSION**\n\nOur new i-STAT Alinity TBI Plasma test helps to quickly assess traumatic brain injury (TBI) on a portable device and can potentially rule out the need for a head CT scan, saving people time and money.\nA HUB FOR MALNUTRITION RESEARCH\nWe created the Abbott Center for Malnutrition Solutions \u2014 and have invested $45 million \u2014 to activate cross-function innovation and engage external experts in developing solutions.\nREAD MORE ON PAGE 21\n\nCLOSING GAPS IN CARE\nWe increased malaria screening by 68% by collaborating with the Rwandan Ministry of Health to help ensure second-generation health posts can sustainably address gaps in infectious disease care and testing.\nREAD MORE ON PAGE 21\n\nPROMOTING HEALTHY HABITS\nWe have launched a three-year partnership with Real Madrid Football Club and its charitable foundation to deliver sports and nutrition education to children around the globe.\nREAD MORE ON PAGE 19\n\nFUTURE WELL KIDS\nWhen in-person learning was restricted, we delivered our chronic disease education program, Future Well Kids, virtually.

The goal is to produce more racially and ethnically diverse nurses and trialists who, if given the opportunity, will dramatically impact trials in the future.\nREAD MORE ON PAGE 18\nWe remain committed to fighting COVID-19, creating products, supporting healthcare infrastructure and conducting research to protect people and society.\n\nIN OUR WORKPLACES\nProtecting our people on-site remained a priority throughout 2021. In addition to distributing personal protective equipment (PPE) and maintaining rigorous cleaning processes, we established programs that help keep everyone healthy. These included providing at-home tests in the U.S. and establishing several on-site testing and vaccination facilities. And we conducted more than 2 million diagnostic tests for employees at more than 100 Abbott sites.\n\nFOR OUR CUSTOMERS\nThe degree to which people rely on rapid diagnostic products has only become more apparent over the past two years. We know testing is the first line of defense against COVID-19 and have produced 12 COVID-19 tests for both high-volume laboratories and doctors\u2019 offices to date. We have also innovated quick, efficient distribution methods, including:\n\n- Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test vending machines at the National University of Singapore.\n- ID NOW rapid molecular testing sites in 13 airports across India.\n- Partnering with United Airlines to offer at-home tests for travelers returning to the U.S. that meet Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines.\n\nIN OUR COMMUNITIES\nWe maintained focus on helping develop infrastructure to support vaccine rollouts, equitable testing access and COVID-19 education. To date, we have invested more than $41 million across 66 countries. In India, where cases spiked in May 2021, Abbott and the Abbott Fund supported the efforts of our local citizenship partner, Self Employed Women\u2019s Association (SEWA), to restore livelihoods for low-income communities, creating awareness on COVID-19 prevention, symptoms and treatment, and building temporary quarantine centers. Through our global nongovernmental organization (NGO) partners, CARE andAmericares, we supported district and civil hospitals with essential equipment and other supplies, helping expand capacities of healthcare facilities. We also supported government organizations on frontline duty with our pharmaceuticals and nutrition products.\n\nWe continued to partner with Rush University Medical Center and the Alive Faith Network in Chicago, deploying testing and screening for over 2,400 people. In Minneapolis, we worked with the University of Minnesota Community-University Health Care Center to deliver services to 3,600 patients impacted by COVID-19.\n\nIn Waukegan and North Chicago, Illinois, we helped prepare 200 children and their families for the fall semester through sponsorship of the Boys & Girls Club of Lake County\u2019s in-person summer program. We also provided grants to three schools in Waukegan to provide families with basic needs, including emergency support.\n\nFOR THE FUTURE\nEarly virus detection is key to preventing \u2014 or quickly responding to \u2014 future pandemics. In March 2021, building on our decades-long history of viral surveillance, we launched the Abbott Pandemic Defense Coalition to identify and help contain emerging health threats.\n\nREAD MORE ON PAGE 19\nAbbott is a global healthcare company, dedicated to improving people\u2019s health at all ages and stages of life.

Our leadership covenant specifically states that corporate officers are accountable for the achievement of Abbott\u2019s 2030 Sustainability Plan goals.\n\nTo learn more, visit the Compensation Link to Sustainability section of our 2022 Proxy Statement.\n\nRead more about our Board of Directors on page 75 and see details of executive compensation in our 2022 Proxy Statement.\nINNOVATE FOR ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\n\nThe world needs new approaches to health \u2014 \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d won\u2019t get it done, and cutting-edge innovations alone won\u2019t be enough. We believe the best healthcare solutions are the ones that help the most people. That\u2019s why we\u2019re designing new products and reimagining existing ones to maximize access to life-changing technologies and services, increase our positive impact on the world and sustain Abbott for years to come.\n\nIn early 2022, Abbott became the first healthcare company to deliver a keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). Through it, we outlined our vision for the future of healthcare.\n\nDuring the show, Abbott\u2019s BinaxNOW COVID-19 Self Test was just one of five of our products recognized with a Best of Innovation award.\n\nINITIATIVE SPOTLIGHT\n\nIn early 2022, Abbott became the first healthcare company to deliver a keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). Through it, we outlined our vision for the future of healthcare.\n\nDIGITIZE\nConnect people with timely, accurate and actionable health information\n\nDECENTRALIZE\nDeliver care where and when it\u2019s needed beyond the hospital or clinic\n\nDEMOCRATIZE\nMake health tech more accessible, personal and convenient to more people\nOur Approach to Access and Affordability\n\nWe work to deliver more affordable, more accessible solutions that effectively address pressing health needs. We are partnering strategically to break down barriers to care and innovating to help people live fuller lives.\n\nWe have outlined three Design Principles to embed innovating access and affordability in how we develop and bring technologies and products to the people who need them:\n\n**DESIGN FOR BROADER REACH AND EQUITY**\nBuild an innovation portfolio that reaches more people, including new geographies and communities with limited access to care.\n\n**DESIGN FOR ACCESS**\nIdentify and overcome barriers to access and adoption, prioritizing inclusive design as well as manufacturing, distribution and technology strategies to reduce costs across the value chain.\n\n**DESIGN TO OPTIMIZE REACH AND VALUE**\nMake intentional decisions throughout the design process to optimize four factors: people reached, consumer benefit, business and societal value.\n\n**OUR 2030 GOALS PROGRESS**\n\nBecame anchor sponsor of the Health Equity Now platform to support Americans with diabetes\n\nLaunched Ultrace 1.0 to help improve outcomes for coronary artery procedures\n\nProvided decentralized healthcare services to over 705,000 people globally\n\nDeveloped a hepatitis B virus biomarker program to inform enhanced treatments\n\n2.2B LIVES IMPROVED from Abbott\u2019s products and services\n\nLaunched NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic, increasing access to care by letting doctors remotely assess symptoms and adjust therapies for patients with chronic pain or movement disorders\n\nFor specific information on our 2030 goals around Access and Affordability, see page 10.\nOur Management Approach\n\nInnovation is a key growth driver for Abbott. We manage innovation across the breadth of our value chain to help ensure maximum access to products and services that can help people live fuller, healthier lives. We\u2019ve embedded considerations of access and affordability into our product design, development, manufacturing processes and commercialization. We\u2019re leveraging our technologies to make real progress against chronic disease, malnutrition and infectious diseases. And we\u2019re harnessing our global presence, developing strategic partnerships, and investing in community projects and sustainable infrastructure to help ensure equitable access to quality healthcare.\n\nThe Scientific Governing Board\n\nThe responsibility for driving life-changing health innovations is within the purview of Abbott\u2019s Scientific Governing Board. The board\u2019s 16 members include the heads of research and development (R&D) from all of Abbott\u2019s businesses. Together they represent decades of experience in health technology and science industries.\n\nThe Scientific Governing Board meets monthly to discuss Abbott\u2019s progress on innovating to advance access and affordability, developments in health technology and areas where cross-business collaboration could support novel product designs. This group is responsible for driving our product design principles into each Abbott business. It also puts forward nominations for Abbott\u2019s Volwiler Society, an organization we established in 1985 to recognize, support and celebrate our most distinguished scientists and engineers for creating breakthrough technologies that change millions of lives around the world.\n\nNominees must meet rigorous criteria and demonstrate a history of consistent scientific and technical contributions. Having a program like this in place is testament to the importance Abbott places on innovation.\n\nToday, the Volwiler Society has 125 members, several of whom are also members of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE) \u2014 a nonprofit organization representing the most accomplished individuals in these fields.\n\nThe AIMBE brings together over 1,500 people from academia, industry, government and scientific societies to create an influential network of experts committed to advancing medical and biological engineering for the good of society.\n\nHow We Guide Our Efforts\n\nWe want our products and technologies to reach as many people who need them as possible. We track our progress against six areas to help ensure we have our greatest possible impact:\n\n- Innovate for access and affordability\n- People served\n- Transforming standards of care\n- Health outcomes\n- Cost savings\n- Infrastructure\n\nScott Muerhoff, a Distinguished Research Fellow in Abbott\u2019s Volwiler Society, drove development of the biologics for Abbott\u2019s COVID-19 serology portfolio, contributing to four important assays, including the BinaxNOW rapid antigen test.\nInnovating for Impact\n\nBy 2030, we plan to improve the lives of one in every three people a year, providing increasingly accessible solutions and delivering more to under-resourced areas.\n\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\n\nIn 2021, Abbott products made a difference in the lives of more than 2.2 billion people, and the Abbott Fund worked with 62 partners in 245 sites to serve nearly 633,000 people.2\n\nPartnering to Boost Participation\n\nGlobally, the number of young people donating blood is on the decline. To address this trend, in 2015, we launched BE THE 1 \u2014 the first global recruitment movement focusing on expanding the pool of young donors. Since then, more than 100 blood and plasma centers have embraced the campaign and donations have increased as much as 37% in certain countries.\n\nIn 2021, we launched \u201cGive Blood. Get Back,\u201d a campaign that reached more than 50 million people in the U.S. As part of this program, we engaged 15 influencers on TikTok and Instagram, and included a licensed song and TikTok dance challenge, achieving unprecedented positive response and Gen Z/ Millennial engagement. Less than 48 hours after launch, more than 2,000 people accessed the website to find a location to donate with a 40% click-through rate.\n\nInclusive Clinical Trial Representation\n\nWe believe data collected in clinical trials should be representative of the people our products are intended to serve. But today, while people of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds make up nearly 40% of the U.S. population, and are disproportionately impacted by chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, they are still heavily underrepresented in the clinical trials process. To help address the disparities that exist in clinical trials, we\u2019re developing an outreach plan to build trust in areas where trial participants haven\u2019t traditionally been included. We want to work with others who recognize the need to overcome four substantial barriers to diverse participation in clinical trials:\n\n- Lack of access to facilities, trials and/or resources in the area\n- Lack of understanding on the benefits to self or community through participation\n- Lack of trust in institutions or individuals due to prior bad experiences\n- Lack of clarity across languages\n\nPart of our outreach includes forming an advisory board, with the goal of determining how best to increase participation across gender and ethnic lines. Some of the ways we plan to overcome these barriers and progress in this area include:\n\n- Recruiting, training, developing and coaching women and ethnically diverse doctors who reflect their communities and are interested in clinical trials\n- Committing $5 million to fund nearly 300 scholarships through new partnerships with medical schools at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and minority nursing associations, with the goal of producing more racially and ethnically diverse nurses and trialists who, if given the opportunity, will dramatically impact trials in the future\n- Expanding clinical trials into new sites in more communities to reach underrepresented patients\n- Connecting with diverse participants and cultivating trust and education through the use of culturally appropriate materials\n\nBy expanding the reach of studies to include diverse groups, we can achieve a clearer image of our products\u2019 impacts in real-world situations. Armed with this information, we can continue to develop solutions that help even more people.\n\nWhen we initiated our LIFE-BTK study on a treatment for people with advanced peripheral artery disease (PAD), we established a diverse team of investigators and performed trials across several locations to reach underrepresented demographics. Partnerships with institutes like the Women as One physician organization helped further diversify the process. Similarly, our Beyond Intervention research gathered insights from over 1,800 people across 13 countries to create a more complete picture of how technology can improve the care of patients with vascular disease.\n\n2 Figures include all people served by the Abbott Fund, covering health access, disaster relief and Future WellKids.\n3 https://www.diabetes.org/healthequitynow\n\nINCREASING ACCESS TO DIABETES CARE\n\nThe Health Equity Bill of Rights \u2014 established by the American Diabetes Association \u2014 posits 10 basic rights for people with diabetes and prediabetes. We have sponsored a pilot initiative designed by the association to address right #9:\n\nThe right to the latest medical advances\n\nToday, Black Americans are 60% more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes, yet much less likely to have their condition well managed. The goal of our three-year, $5 million effort is to reduce health inequities by removing barriers to tools and technology for diabetes management, regardless of income level or insurance status. The pilot seeks to better understand and address the healthcare disparities for Black people living with diabetes. Focusing initial efforts in Columbus, Ohio, we will help by sponsoring campaigns to enhance awareness, access to and adoption of these tools. In collaboration with the National Center for Urban Solutions (NCUS), 150 Black residents living with diabetes will have access to health education, physical training, nutritional support and Abbott\u2019s FreeStyle Libre flash glucose monitoring technology.\nInnovating to Improve Health Outcomes\n\nWe are continuously exploring how we can help people live longer and better, finding measurable ways to address social challenges and improve health outcomes with scientific and technical expertise.\n\nPartnering for Better Outcomes\nIn addition to ensuring our solutions deliver the best care possible, we work with others to magnify and enhance the outcomes of our efforts. For example, we have partnered with the Tanzanian government for more than 20 years to drive sustainable improvements to the country\u2019s healthcare system, delivering emergency care to more than 1 million patients to date.\n\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\n\nProactively Addressing Pandemic Threats\nIn 2020, building on our decades-long experience in viral surveillance, we established the Abbott Pandemic Defense Coalition to help identify new pathogens, analyze potential risk levels, develop and deploy diagnostic testing and assess public health impacts. Throughout 2021, we expanded the coalition, leveraging the expertise of global centers of excellence in laboratory testing, genetic sequencing and public health research to respond to the emergence of the COVID-19 Omicron variant. Fourteen cross-continent sites, including Abbott, contributed to this research.\n\nWe partnered with The Task Force for Global Health on a first-of-its-kind field program to train the next generation of epidemiologists. Additionally, a virology fellowship with the Global Virus Network will help develop future virologists.\n\nImproving Outcomes With Ultron\nWe aim to improve outcomes for 1 million patients annually using our Ultron software to optimize percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) by 2030. In 2021, we began the rollout of Ultron 1.0 software, which merges imaging technology with artificial intelligence to enhance visualization of PCI procedures. The software can automatically detect blockage severity and measure blood vessel characteristics, supporting more precise decisions. The game-changing capabilities of this software resulted in Ultron 1.0 receiving honoree recognition at the CES 2022 Innovation Awards.\n\nUltron 1.0 represents the first of several such platforms. The data we\u2019re collecting from it are already informing development of Ultron 2.0 \u2014 a system that will be accessible to smaller centers, improving outcomes for a growing number of patients.\n\n4 PCI is a minimally invasive procedure used to open coronary arteries and restore blood flow.\n\nSCORING BIG FOR KIDS\u2019 HEALTH\nIn 2021, we entered into a three-year agreement to be the Health Sciences and Nutrition Partner for Real Madrid Football Club. We have also signed on as Global Partner of the Real Madrid Foundation \u2014 an organization founded by the club to promote the value of sport to children globally.\n\nThe partnership will deliver education, sports and social welfare activities to support children in under-resourced communities in 80 countries. It will also involve working with Real Madrid Foundation social sports schools in 12 countries to provide malnutrition screening, education and nutrition support. Finally, through the agreement, we will address nutrition needs through Real Madrid Foundation clinics, which are hosted in 42 countries.\nPricing Discipline to Improve Access\n\nHealthcare products are a valuable societal investment \u2014 they enable people and societies to flourish. We are committed to finding innovative ways to improve efficiency and consumer access to our life-changing products.\n\nAffordable Diagnostics\n\nOur diagnostics business is always on the lookout for ways to improve costs by increasing efficiency in our manufacturing, supply chain and product support areas. Over the past four years, we have realized year-over-year improvements in cost of goods for more than 80% of products by volume.\n\nCost Savings Fund Innovation\n\nThroughout 2021, our sites took several steps to improve operational efficiency, resulting in cost savings that help drive our investment in innovation. For example:\n\n- In Africa, we launched malaria diagnostic tests with smaller packaging dimensions, reducing required distribution trips and lowering logistics costs by around 28% for customers. We also increased accessibility of these products and helped ensure continuity of supply by combining the supply capabilities of our manufacturing facility in China with those of our site in Korea.\n\n- Additionally, we completed a regulatory submission for small-pack HIV diagnostic tests. The suggested reduction in kit box dimensions will translate into approximately 50% logistics cost savings for customers as a result of improved shipping efficiency.\n\n- To enable affordability for the governments and agencies purchasing our Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test, we have improved materials and labor efficiency and have achieved a 32% decrease in manufacturing costs.\n\n- Additionally, the launch of a new diagnostic product for traumatic brain injury (TBI) \u2014 the i-STAT Alinity TBI Plasma \u2014 will enable concussion diagnoses through blood tests. This will reduce the need for expensive CT scans, bringing down overall healthcare costs following head injuries.\n\nVALUE EMBEDDED BY DESIGN\n\nOne of Abbott\u2019s Core Design Principles is to optimize the products we create across four factors: people reached, consumer benefit, business and societal value. Doing so starts with understanding the needs of our customers \u2014 from patients and healthcare professionals to policymakers and those who fund developments.\n\nAn important example of this principle in action can be found in the Early Value Assessment (EVA) process. Through this process, we help ensure the expectations of key stakeholders are upheld even as we target increased access and affordability.\n\nThrough the EVA, we proactively identify steps that will drive economic and clinical value for future products. Recommendations are then captured during design and development processes; in turn, positively impacting future reimbursement, coverage and access for patients.\nInfrastructure and Transforming Standards of Care\n\nWe are building infrastructure, offering training and providing resources to help decentralize care and transform healthcare standards in communities around the world.\n\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\n\nIn 2021, we extended support to 32 healthcare centers, including training 2,851 healthcare workers on decentralized services. We provided over 705,000 people with decentralized services globally.\n\nThe Abbott Center for Malnutrition Solutions\n\nThe Abbott Center for Malnutrition Solutions \u2014 our cross-functional innovation hub \u2014 is working to improve identification, treatment and prevention of malnutrition. External partnerships, research, innovation and financial support also contribute to developing accessible, sustainable and locally relevant options for those most in need.\n\nAddressing Gaps in Care\n\nIn 2019, we began working with the Rwandan Ministry of Health and the Society for Family Health Rwanda to build an independent, decentralized and financially stable health network. Together, we launched second-generation health posts to address gaps in primary care and testing for HIV and other infectious diseases, including malaria. Through December 2021, these posts have treated approximately 260,000 people.\n\nIn certain areas, where the closest existing facilities were up to three hours away, health posts have increased access to care eightfold and cut travel times to around 17 minutes. Since inception, malaria screenings have risen by 68%, with 21,000 residents treated for positive cases.\n\nA recent study determined that most of the care provided during visits to these posts would not have occurred without them. The health post\u2019s main benefit was a substantial increase in the use of curative primary care for conditions such as malaria, intestinal parasites and acute respiratory infections. These health posts are also financially stable and will be able to sustainably provide care for local residents. During their second year of operation, these posts generated an economic profit of 29%.\n\nThe study also demonstrated that access to these health posts addressed a high demand for these services in rural Rwanda. As a means to improving the health of Rwanda\u2019s rural population, these facilities are both improving equity within Rwanda and providing a roadmap for doing the same globally.\n\nTransforming Virus Research with Biomarkers\n\nWe have launched a hepatitis B virus (HBV) biomarker program to expand understanding of, and treatment for, patients with chronic HBV. Using HBV RNA and surface antigen tests, we are conducting studies to inform more effective treatments. While research is ongoing, evidence for the value of biomarkers in moderating patient care has already been shared in 14 publications.\n\nDiagnostic Panels for Enhanced Treatment\n\nA diagnostic panel is a predetermined group of medical tests used in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Panels support development of more effective treatments. In 2021, we launched, or set the groundwork for, three targeted panels.\n\n- Antenatal Care (ANC) Panel: established to improve lives and reduce mortality for the 20 million mothers and children in high-burden countries through regular screening and infection hotspot maps. It supports the World Health Organization\u2019s mission to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV, HBV and syphilis by 2030.\n- Malnutrition Panel: research is underway to improve well-being for children and pregnant women, using biomarkers to identify micronutrient deficiencies via clinical and at-home tests. Development of this panel will continue into 2022 and beyond.\n- Fever Panel: development has started to understand how biomarkers can help clinicians better identify root causes of fever, enabling proper treatment and care. This will be particularly important in pregnant women and young children. It will also aid infection identification in patients with fever-like and other \u201cgeneric\u201d symptoms.\nDRIVING DIABETES CARE IN UNDERINVESTED COMMUNITIES\n\nIn 2019, the Abbott Fund launched our Future Well Communities program in Stockton, California, to address health disparities by removing barriers that prevent people with diabetes from living a healthy life. Working in close partnership with community groups and leading institutions, our goal is to improve the health of 10,000 people in neighborhoods facing the greatest impacts of disparities and diabetes. We are taking a patient-centered approach, meeting people where they are to reduce the impact of diabetes in these communities.\n\nOne of the ways we are accomplishing this is through our Healthy Food Rx pilot initiative. In a community where 57% of people are living with diabetes or prediabetes, we are partnering locally to demonstrate improved clinical and behavioral outcomes with a twice-monthly home delivery of healthy meals for six months. Patients can access on-demand cooking classes and other nutritional resources to help meet their specific dietary needs.\n\nRead more about 2021 Future Well Communities efforts online.\nAbbott\u2019s Community Impact\n\nWhen communities thrive, we all thrive. Abbott has a long-standing history of contributing expertise, product, cash and time to help support our communities.\n\nTACKLING NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES\n\nOur Future Well initiatives help drive progress against noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). In Stockton, California, Future Well Communities is advancing health equity and removing the barriers that prevent people with diabetes from living healthy lives. Learn more on page 22.\n\nOur school-based Future Well Kids program promotes lifelong healthy habits from an early age. In 2021, we initiated activities in Colombia and the UK, expanding the program\u2019s reach to five countries in total. We delivered lessons virtually to students in the U.S., Mexico and Ireland, reaching over 600 students during the 2020\u20132021 school year. A refreshed Future Well Kids website makes it easier for educators and families to integrate standards-aligned resources on the human body, physical activity, nutrition and healthy lifestyle into the classroom or home.\n\nRead more about Future Well Kids on page 35.\n\nA MODEL FOR NCD PREVENTION\n\nIn 2019, Abbott and CARE announced a three-year, $1 million partnership to address NCDs among populations internally displaced by armed conflict in Marawi, Philippines. Among the first of its kind, the program is creating a scalable and replicable model for the prevention and care of chronic diseases in humanitarian crisis settings. This includes increasing NCD screening, providing health education, monitoring and referral services, and building capacity and awareness on prevention and control. Abbott has also been donating rapid-testing technology, diabetes monitors and test strips.\n\nThe results are encouraging. Following targeted interventions, patients with controlled blood sugar levels rose to 59.1%, up from 50.8% at baseline, and more than 65% of patients improved their fasting glucose level, which is important to reducing overall risks of related health complications.\n\nNATURAL DISASTER RELIEF\n\nFor 16 years, we have been partnering with Feeding America and Direct Relief to prepare communities for hurricane season. Critically needed supplies, including rehydration solutions and nutrition products, are distributed to food banks and health clinics across high-risk areas in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. In 2021, these programs supported more than 12,000 people. Last year, we broadened these efforts, implementing a disaster resilience strategy to help prevent and mitigate negative impacts on communities in New Orleans, Dallas, Orlando and Puerto Rico.\n\nWe are committed to rapid response following natural disasters and other emergencies. In 2021, Abbott and the Abbott Fund donated approximately $2 million in cash and product to address immediate needs and long-term recovery efforts. This included providing relief following flooding in China, Germany, Turkey and the U.S.; earthquakes in Croatia and Haiti; wildfires in Turkey; hurricanes in the U.S.; and support for Afghan refugees in the U.S.\n\nVIRTUALLY EXPLORING HEART HEALTH WITH FUTURE WELL KIDS\n\nWhen in-person learning was restricted, we worked with Discovery Education to develop a virtual field trip for children aged 10\u201313 to learn about the importance of cardiovascular health.\n\nThrough Your Heart, students explore the heart and how hydration, eating right and exercising regularly keeps this vital organ healthy. Our science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) interns, in-house experts and three-time Olympian Lolo Jones brought lessons to life through engaging videos and demonstrations, all available online and on demand.\nRESPONSIBLY CONNECT DATA, TECHNOLOGY AND CARE\n\nEvery day, people put their health in our hands \u2014 it\u2019s a responsibility we take seriously. Data and technology hold the key to transforming healthcare, and we\u2019re committed to leveraging this power while protecting the information people share with us.\n\nINITIATIVE SPOTLIGHT\n\nManaging diabetes can be overwhelming. We\u2019re collaborating on smarter systems that simplify diabetes care, connecting FreeStyle Libre products with delivery systems and a coaching platform to offer personalized experiences that help people understand and manage their own health in real time.\n\n5X more frequent glucose scanning with FreeStyle Libre 2\n\nTAILORED COACHING\n\nwith Omada Health platform and FreeStyle Libre 14-day system\n\nCONNECTED TECHNOLOGIES\n\nlike our FreeStyle Libre smartphone app that gives users clear information about their glucose status without the use of a separate reader, and LibreLinkUp, an app that allows healthcare providers and loved ones to monitor your glucose levels remotely.\nOur Approach to Responsible Data\n\nTimely, accurate and secure data can empower people to take control of their own health, and it can help connect them to care, wherever they are. Protecting that data is key to achieving our vision of digitized, democratized and decentralized healthcare.\n\nThe Principles of Data Use\n\nTechnology has always fueled advances in healthcare, and we plan to remain at the forefront of this progress. As we expand our data capabilities, we are also implementing increasingly robust measures for managing and protecting large volumes of private information.\n\nWe have established three guiding principles to direct our efforts and ensure we are:\n\n- **TRANSPARENT** in communicating to people and letting them know how their data will be used.\n- **RESPONSIBLE** in our role in enabling the power of data and also in its appropriate use and protection.\n- **INTENTIONAL** in how we connect our technology, what data we collect and how we use it and protect it.\n\n**OUR 2030 GOALS PROGRESS**\n\n- Published a formal commitment to customer and patient privacy and information protection.\n- Established a coordinated vulnerability disclosure program with a mechanism for reporting product and system vulnerabilities.\n- Maintained a cybersecurity certification program that includes external SOC 2 and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001 assessments.\n- Partnered to develop future cybersecurity talent as a founding member of the University of Minnesota Center for Medical Device Cybersecurity.\n\nFor specific information on our 2030 goals around Responsible Data, see page 11.\nData Privacy and Security, Governance and Management\n\nWe are committed to responsibly collecting, using and protecting personal information. Strong governance and a centralized privacy program ensure we uphold the most rigorous standards.\n\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\n\nThroughout 2021, we performed maturity assessments for both our privacy and product security organizations. The results give us a stronger view of our capabilities and will help drive continuous improvement initiatives. We also produced new data privacy principles, effective as of January 1, 2022, to make our position on information collection, data use and sharing, and security clear and publicly available.\n\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH\n\nTo provide personalized treatments we must draw on patient and customer insights. To address potential privacy risks, we develop our products, processes and internal systems securely, embedding data safety considerations in everything we do. We comply with local regulations for reporting and notification of security breaches involving customers\u2019 personal information in all locations where Abbott operates.\n\nWe transitioned our global privacy program to a centralized system in 2018, to drive a consistent approach across Abbott. Our Global Privacy Office \u2014 part of our Office of Ethics and Compliance (OEC) \u2014 is overseen by the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer and the Divisional Vice President for Global Privacy. Dedicated global professionals, as well as country-specific privacy champions, identify and address data privacy matters. Clear standards, processes and training develop employee understanding of how to protect sensitive information, making data privacy a shared responsibility.\n\nOversight Committees\n\nIn addition to the Global Privacy Office, we have two oversight committees that connect with key stakeholders across Abbott. Each oversight committee also has its own operational committees that engage at a product and business-unit level.\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Privacy Oversight Committee brings together officers from Legal, OEC, Finance, Human Resources, Quality and Information Technology. Its role is to provide oversight to senior management on Abbott\u2019s cybersecurity and privacy programs, and to advise on and monitor strategies. The Product Security Oversight Committee, established in January 2020, comprises corporate and division senior leadership across Abbott. The committee meets quarterly to develop our strategy and approach to product security, monitoring progress and supporting company-wide compliance.\n\nIn addition, Abbott\u2019s senior cybersecurity and privacy leaders provide regular updates to the Board of Directors and Board Committees, providing progress updates, sharing opportunities for improvement and embedding data protection and cybersecurity into the top levels of governance.\n\nKEEPING PATIENTS AND DOCTORS CONNECTED DURING COVID-19\n\nWe envision a world where data to inform better health choices is right at our fingertips. Our \u201cconnected care\u201d devices bring new sight to healthcare, enabling remote monitoring of patients \u2014 something that has taken on new importance during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOur NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic met increasing demand for virtual care when in-person appointments were limited. Encrypted, authenticated in-app video chats and remote programming allowed doctors to monitor and adjust patient neuromodulation devices, all with the click of a button. And, so people feel protected while using the NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic, we have built it to comply with key privacy standards, like the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\n\nThe service holds the potential to transform how patients receive care, something TIME magazine recognized when it named NeuroSphere to its list of 100 best inventions of 2021.\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH\n\nWe understand the potential impact of cyberattacks \u2014 for Abbott\u2019s systems, and for the people who have entrusted us with their data. We focus on reducing risks of security breaches by regularly updating our systems and protocols. We have evolved our governance approach to have laser focus on two prominent cyber categories: enterprise and product cybersecurity.\n\nOur Enterprise cybersecurity organization is focused on ensuring the security and availability of the systems and technologies that support Abbott\u2019s business operations. There are also regional cybersecurity leaders deployed in strategic geographies around the world for local support. This organization is led by Abbott\u2019s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).\n\nOur Product cybersecurity organization is focused on driving cybersecurity standards throughout the total product life cycle. At the corporate level, we provide shared services to our business units such as inventory and vulnerability management to leverage economies of scale. Our divisions and product teams also have cybersecurity expertise, ensuring that our products and medical devices are secure by design. Our Cybersecurity and Quality organizations partner to incorporate cybersecurity throughout the total product life cycle, from design to the integrity of quality data systems. This organization is led by Abbott\u2019s Divisional Vice President of Product Security. Both cybersecurity leaders report to Abbott\u2019s Chief Information Officer (CIO), who has overall responsibility. Our CIO reports directly to our Chief Financial Officer (CFO), who in turn reports to our Chief Executive Officer (CEO).\n\nEnterprise Cybersecurity\n\nPhishing attacks and social engineering scams are among the largest cybersecurity threats. One of the most important objectives of this organization is creating a security-focused culture and providing our employees clear direction on security controls necessary to protect operations. Our focus is to create a strong cybersecurity foundation by placing controls around our infrastructure and securing our operations to reduce vulnerabilities. We do this through education and awareness, designing the right cybersecurity architecture, implementing incident monitoring and response efforts, manufacturing cybersecurity, disaster recovery planning efforts and other services provided to the enterprise. Regardless of where employees are or what business function they represent, Abbott believes every employee plays a critical role in protecting Abbott data and business systems and infrastructure. Our company-wide cybersecurity training program ensures that employees and contractors receive targeted training on phishing awareness and monitors results to identify retraining requirements. This way, we can help ensure everyone at Abbott understands that protecting sensitive data and personal information is everyone\u2019s responsibility.\n\nThis year we created new roles for divisional Business Information Security Officers (BISOs) to embed cybersecurity further into our businesses. Additionally, the Data Loss Protection Program is designed to implement the proper security controls that will help monitor and prevent unauthorized data sharing.\n\nPARTNERING ON SECURITY\n\nCybersecurity issues can\u2019t be addressed in a vacuum. That\u2019s why we maintain multi-stakeholder partnerships to understand the latest cybersecurity threats and trends, support research and inform new standards and best practices, including:\n\n- Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center (H-ISAC)\n- Medical Device Innovation Consortium (MDIC)\n- International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF)\n- Healthcare and Public Health Sector Coordinating Council (HPHSCC)\nProduct Cybersecurity\n\nThe growth of connected medical devices, products, diagnostics platforms and systems means healthcare professionals can provide their patients with smarter, faster and more effective treatments. At Abbott, we are unlocking potential solutions to some of our most difficult healthcare challenges. But we are also aware of evolving security threats, and we adapt our security measures to meet this changing world. Our approach to product cybersecurity is guided by four pillars:\n\n1. **Cybersecurity-embedded design**\n   - to ensure we embed cybersecurity considerations throughout the total product life cycle.\n\n2. **Threat and risk analysis**\n   - to identify new threats and deploy controls, informed by external experts and information-sharing agreements with healthcare and cybersecurity specialists.\n\n3. **Testing by internal and external experts**\n   - A regular testing program ensures our devices, products and systems meet or exceed cybersecurity standards.\n\n4. **Partnering with industry**\n   - (more information on page 27) to support trend assessments, information sharing and creation of standards that protect patients and maintain trust.\n\nWe maintain a cybersecurity certification program that includes SOC 2 and ISO 27001 assessments for multiple Abbott products that process protected health information. These assessments are performed by an independent external auditor and cover the design and effectiveness of Abbott\u2019s cybersecurity program and controls.\n\nMany of our products and programs are designed to collect information that can help people make better decisions about managing their health. This information also helps us understand how to make our products better and what our customers want to learn more about. Our goal is to ensure our devices, products and systems meet the highest security standards, and that commitment guides our approach to protecting data and privacy across our businesses.\n\nTo strengthen our ability to respond to changing circumstances, we have developed a customized cybersecurity control framework, informed by robust existing internal and industry strategies. The framework will support Product Security maturity assessments, providing a benchmark against which to measure progress.\nBUILD THE DIVERSE, INNOVATIVE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW\n\nOur employees\u2019 innovative ideas, hard work and dedication are helping build a sustainable and healthy future. What do they get from Abbott in return? One, they have the opportunity to grow, learn and have a rewarding career. Two, they can use the health, wellness and financial benefits we provide to build a secure life for themselves and their families. And three, they can be their true selves while working with other amazing people, doing work that truly matters.\n\nAs we continue to prepare our existing workforce for the jobs of tomorrow, we also work to develop a pipeline of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) talent through our high school and college intern programs; initiatives which, collectively, host hundreds of participants each year. These programs offer students \u2014 particularly female and minority applicants \u2014 the opportunity to kick-start a career in healthcare.\n\n**VOTED**\n\n#1 college internship program in healthcare in the U.S.\n\n70% of former college interns hired as full-time engineers are women\n\n22 LOCATIONS globally participate in our STEM internship program\n\n70% of former college interns hired as full-time engineers are women\n\n22 LOCATIONS globally participate in our STEM internship program\nOur Approach to Building Tomorrow\u2019s Workforce\n\nDedicated employees power our sustainable success. As they drive our growth, we provide a supportive, inclusive culture, and programs that help ensure their continued development and encourage them to build a successful career with us.\n\nOur Workplace Environment Promise\nWe are making a promise to every one of our employees to provide a work environment that:\n\n- Promotes diversity and inclusion\n- Offers extensive professional development, mentoring and training programs\n- Encourages and supports work-life harmony\n- Offers competitive compensation and benefits tailored to each market\n- Protects human rights\n- Promotes overall wellness\n- Contributes to employee health and safety\n\nOur 2030 Goals Progress\n\n| ACHIEVED | 163,315 development and job opportunities for current and future employees |\n| 40% of global management positions are filled by women |\n| $3.5M in savings contributions through our Freedom 2 Save program |\n| 44.6% female representation in STEM roles |\n| 1,375 young people participated in 2021 internship programs |\n| 33% of leadership roles held by people from underrepresented groups |\n| 45% of targeted new jobs filled internally |\n\nFor specific information on our 2030 goals around Building Tomorrow\u2019s Workforce, see page 12.\nTalent Management\n\nTo continually innovate lifesaving solutions, we must empower our teams with skills to meet the health needs of tomorrow.\n\nOUR APPROACH\n\nTalent management is overseen by our Executive Vice President, Human Resources \u2014 who reports directly to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) \u2014 and corporate officers, all of whom carry talent management goals.\n\nAttracting the Best Talent\n\nWe seek to maintain long-term relationships with candidates, showing them that their unique skills are valued by Abbott. We engage with candidates to provide all the information they need to succeed during interviews \u2014 including offering them access to our Abbott Talent Community \u2014 and maintain ongoing connections with them through our social channels. This way, we can build a pipeline of qualified, interested candidates that we can consider for future opportunities.\n\nIn addition, we engage organizations such as Advancing Minorities\u2019 Interest in Engineering (AMIE) and the Society of Women Engineers to identify diverse talent. Partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) institutions like Howard University and North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University also support our future employee pipeline.\n\nOur career site employs artificial intelligence to enhance the application process, streamlining user experiences with tailored content and a personalized chatbot to help identify roles. In 2021, Abbott filled 26,184 positions, and 15% of all open positions were filled by internal candidates.\n\nIn addition, we engage organizations such as Advancing Minorities\u2019 Interest in Engineering (AMIE) and the Society of Women Engineers to identify diverse talent.

Through our many programs and resources, we provide opportunities for individual growth and development, helping employees build great long-term careers at Abbott. We value our experienced employees; their knowledge helps us succeed as a company and contributes to a strong succession pipeline.\n\nSome of the resources that help our employees progress include:\n\n- Ongoing reviews, career development discussions and goal setting with managers\n- Access to Career Connect \u2014 our personalized career development and planning tool\n- Mentoring, job-specific education and leadership training\n- Annual performance management processes\n\nOur Board of Directors conducts an annual Talent Management Review (TMR) to review critical position succession plans and development actions. TMRs are also held at divisional, functional, country, region and team levels to find Ready Now and Ready Future successors, and to support intentional development plans for them. Included in these discussions is the identification of early career talent with leadership potential.\n\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\n\nLearning Opportunities\n\nWe offer many employee development opportunities, working to bring more online each year. Throughout 2021, we delivered an average of 28 hours of training and development per full-time employee (FTE). This equated to an average training and development spend of $227 per FTE.\n\nAlso in 2021, Abbott launched a comprehensive leadership training program called Leading With Impact (LWI) for over 18,000 people managers worldwide. LWI provides 12 weeks of self-paced, virtually delivered, immediately applicable coaching and training.\n\nBy the end of 2021, 17,375 people managers had participated. Through the program, they gained new skills, tools and perspectives to help them create a more supportive, inclusive and rewarding environment for their teams.\n\nIndustry-Leading Internships\n\nInternships offer future innovators first-hand industry experience. Throughout 2021, we expanded our IT and Computer Science internship in the U.S., with plans underway to bring our Engineering co-op program to more applicants. Our college internship program was voted #1 in Healthcare in the U.S. and ranked highly in 21 other countries.\n\nRead about our STEM internship expansion on page 33.\n\n5 In previous years, we reported on our corporate-sponsored training only. Due to enhancement in data collection, we are including trainings conducted by our businesses in this submission; these programs were not previously reported. Hence, our results are significantly higher than in 2020.\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\nPromoting diversity and inclusion is integral to how we lead. We want to create an environment that nurtures everyone, regardless of race, gender, age, sexual orientation, disability or nationality.\n\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH\n\nWe are creating a culture where inclusiveness is a natural state, not an initiative. We want it to be the natural way things get done at Abbott. It takes all of us to build and maintain the just and inclusive culture we want to live and work in. To help build engagement, we\u2019ve initiated a program of \u201cLet\u2019s Talk\u201d sessions, in which employees engage in open and honest discussions about diversity and inclusion.\n\nWe are increasing representation of underrepresented groups throughout Abbott. Our Executive Diversity Council consists of diverse leaders who demonstrate their commitment to diversity and inclusion. Members are selected based on characteristics and qualities that highlight their desire to champion and drive diversity and inclusion and span across the enterprise.\n\nThe council meets several times a year to discuss key successes related to diversity and inclusion in the current year, and establish clear priorities for the future. The council can serve as an ad hoc advisor on new programs proposed to maximize inclusion at Abbott, and holds a formal responsibility for supporting the diversity and inclusion strategy development, ensuring diversity and inclusion practices are integrated into business practices/strategy, and program implementation at Abbott.\n\nCommunities of Support\n\nEmployee networks bring underrepresented employees (and their allies) together to share experiences, expand visibility and create opportunities. Almost 15,000 members benefit from the activities and programs our employee network groups support. Each network is supported by our Diversity and Inclusion team and sponsored by an Abbott executive.\n\n| Our Employee Network Groups | Organization | Founded |\n|-----------------------------|--------------|---------|\n| Women Leaders of Abbott (WLA) | 2000         |\n| Black Business Network (BBN) | 2001         |\n| Flex Network (part-time/flexible employees) | 2001 |\n| Asian Leadership and Cultural Network (ALCN) | 2001 |\n| LA VOICE Network (Hispanic and Latino employees) | 2005 |\n| PRIDE (LGBTQ+ employees) | 2007         |\n| Women in STEM | 2016         |\n| Veterans Network | 2017         |\n| Advancing Professionals Network (APN) | 2018 |\n| Abbott disAbility Network | 2021         |\n\nChannels for Ongoing Communication\n\nAs we work to build a more inclusive culture, we monitor our progress in a variety of ways. Annually, all employees have the opportunity to participate in an employee engagement survey. Employees may also be invited to share their views through onboarding and \u201cstay\u201d surveys, sponsored by our businesses and regional/country affiliates.\n\nWe maintain several other channels to gather thoughts. Our Chairman and CEO regularly communicates with employees through various channels, including email and video, and invites their responses. He also holds an annual All Employee meeting that provides an opportunity for employees to pose questions and comments. Our senior leaders also respond to employee comments and concerns at small-group and town-hall-style meetings. Finally, our employee networks have created a host of additional forums for employees to voice opinions, concerns and recommendations for improvements.\n\nMichelle Spencer, Senior Manager Sales Operations in Abbott\u2019s Nutrition business, was honored by our Black Business Network for her inspiring leadership and commitment to diversity and inclusion.\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\n\nMaking Abbott an actively inclusive community is one of our top priorities. In 2021, we launched our inaugural Diversity, Equity & Inclusion report setting out our action plan.\n\nWe\u2019re actively working to increase the number of women in our leadership ranks and across our many STEM roles. The annual Society of Women Engineers conference offers an opportunity to connect with the brightest female minds in the industry.\n\nIn 2021, we nominated seven inspiring Abbott women for inclusion in the Women of Color in STEM Peer Review award. We were proud that Deborah Brown \u2014 our Senior Director of Toxicology \u2014 received an award for Managerial Leadership.\n\nAlso in 2021, we received a number of awards and honors for our performance, including:\n\n- DiversityInc\u2019s Top 50 Companies for Diversity (18 straight years in 2021)\n- 2021 Seramount Inclusion Index\n- 2021 Seramount Best Companies for Multicultural Women\n\n### Ethnic Representation in U.S. Management Positions (totals by race)\n\n| Race            | 2021 | 2020 |\n|-----------------|------|------|\n| White           | 67%  |      |\n| Underrepresented groups | 33%  |      |\n\n### Workplace Gender Diversity, U.S.\n\nOur continued focus has helped us maintain or improve our gender diversity measures across the board, and we take particular pride in the progress we\u2019ve made increasing our percentage of management positions held by women.\n\n| Year | Female share of workforce | Total management positions filled by women | Women in STEM-related positions |\n|------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 2021 | 47%                       | 43%                                      | 43%                            |\n| 2020 | 47%                       | 32%                                      | 42%                            |\n\n### Workplace Gender Diversity, Global\n\n| Year | Female share of workforce | Total management positions filled by women | Women in STEM-related positions |\n|------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 2021 | 45%                       | 40%                                      | 44.6%                          |\n| 2020 | 45%                       | 39%                                      | 44%                            |\n\nNurturing Diversity in STEM\n\nOur High School STEM internship program supports female and minority students making their first steps into STEM fields. It aims to honor diversity in our talent pipeline while advancing prospects for interns.\n\nIn 2021, we expanded the program to Singapore, Vietnam and Puerto Rico, offering placements to 50 students. And, for the first time, U.S. participants could apply for college credit, creating an incentive to stay in STEM and increasing degree completion.\n\nThis year, we plan to expand to Costa Rica, giving more students from diverse backgrounds the opportunity to kick-start their career. And, to expand impact in this area, Abbott has created the \u201cShaping the Future of STEM\u201d blueprint, a scalable plan we share with other companies to help them create their own high school STEM internship programs.\n\nAfter a summer as an intern in Abbott\u2019s Global Product Quality organization, Maya Outlaw joined the company full-time in 2020 in our Operations Professional Development Program.\nProtecting Human Rights\n\nWe play an active role in protecting human rights, complying with laws and regulations wherever we operate and creating our own standards.\n\nOur global guidelines include:\n\n- Providing a healthy and safe working environment\n- Complying with child labor laws and laws prohibiting any form of forced, bonded or indentured labor\n- Promoting workforce diversity and not discriminating against any employee for reasons such as race, religion, color, age, gender, ethnicity, disability, marital status and sexual orientation, in addition to any other status protected by local laws\n- Not tolerating any harassment (sexual or nonsexual) or harsh or inhumane treatment in the workplace; this includes providing harassment training for employees\n- Protecting individual privacy\n\nOur approach to identifying and managing human rights risks\n\nOur processes for managing human rights risks are embedded across our business, encompassing our workforce policies, ethics and compliance program, supply chain management approach, and more. We aim to proactively identify and mitigate potential human rights impacts across our operations and value chain, including risks of discrimination and unequal pay; unsafe working conditions; human trafficking; child labor; and forced or bonded labor. We conduct periodic reviews of our risk exposure, including annual high-level risk assessments of all suppliers (see page 67).\n\nAbbott employees are expected to adhere to all laws and Abbott\u2019s policies, procedures, principles and standards. Our Code of Business Conduct includes prohibitions on illegal and inappropriate labor conditions, and cruel or inhumane treatment. For details on our approach to discrimination and harassment, see page 79, and find more on our approach to compensation and benefits on page 36. Further information on how we ensure the health and safety of our employees and contract workers is on page 38.\n\nIn our supply chain, we establish human rights expectations of all suppliers we enter a business relationship with through our Supplier Guidelines, and conduct assessment, monitoring and auditing of suppliers to identify and mitigate potential risks, including those related to human rights. For further information, see page 64 and page 67.\n\nWe also address human rights risks in our other business relationships, including through our Third-Party Compliance Process, which requires Abbott businesses, subsidiaries and affiliates outside the U.S. to complete due diligence before engaging third-party companies. This includes screening companies, identifying high-risk partners and monitoring and mitigating any potential risks, including human rights risks. For more details, see page 81.\n\nWe investigate reported concerns and actual or potential violations of our policies, and take corrective action, if needed, in a timely manner. Read more on page 67 and page 79.\nEmployee Community Engagement\n\nOur employees care about the people we serve, whether that\u2019s delivering life-changing solutions or giving back to the communities we call home. By supporting local causes, our employees bring to life Abbott\u2019s purpose to help more people than ever achieve better health.\n\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH\nCaring has always been one of our core values. Our Employee Giving Program and volunteering options create spaces for employees to uphold this legacy of care in their communities. Oversight for community engagement sits with our Citizenship organization, including employee giving and volunteering, as well as programs and strategies for product donations.\n\nEmployee Donations and Matched Giving\nIn 2021, we introduced our enhanced Employee Giving Program in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The program brings together our existing Employee Giving Campaign and Abbott Fund Matching Grant Program into one integrated donation program.\n\nThrough the new Employee Giving Program, the Abbott Fund has expanded its guidelines, making more nonprofit organizations eligible for matched donations, and doubling its match to 100% of eligible donations, up from 50% previously. And, so every cent goes to the charity of choice, Abbott commits to paying all processing fees.\n\nEmployee Volunteering\nWe provide employees with a range of opportunities for local volunteering. Most recently, we honored the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. by continuing to offer U.S. employees eight hours of paid time to volunteer \u2014 at any time during the year \u2014 in their community in ways that are meaningful for them.\n\nOur employees are passionate about making a difference in our industry as well, and know that to create the healthcare innovators of tomorrow, we must inspire young people today. We maintain partnerships with schools, educational organizations and nonprofits to promote engagement in STEM.\n\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\nThrough our enhanced Employee Giving Program, which launched in September 2021, employees can donate year-round to organizations they care about. Included in this is our Employee Giving Campaign, an annual donation drive run every October for over 40 years. During the 2021 campaign, 95% of employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico pledged over $15 million to more than 9,500 charitable organizations in a single month \u2014 a clear indicator of their passion for making a difference.\n\n2021 Social Investing\n\n| Category                        | Amount       |\n|---------------------------------|--------------|\n| Cash contributions              | $48,311,612  |\n| In-kind giving, product or service donations | $35,961,192 |\n| Administrative costs            | $5,120,420   |\n| Time, employee volunteering     | $736,774     |\n| **Total**                       | **$90,129,998** |\n\nFUTURE WELL KIDS\nThe Future Well Kids program encourages young people to take charge of their own health today by developing habits that will help them maintain good health their entire lives. Powered almost entirely by Abbott employee volunteers who deliver a fun and engaging curriculum to students ages 10\u201313 throughout the school year, Future Well Kids teaches kids about noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) through lessons about science, health and the human body. During the 2020\u20132021 school year, three countries had the program delivered, with six Abbott sites working with eight partner schools or organizations.\n\nRead more about Future Well Kids on page 23.\n\nFOR THE 2020\u20132021 SCHOOL YEAR\n\n| Category                        | Number       |\n|---------------------------------|--------------|\n| Students positively impacted    | 608          |\n| Classroom visits                | 98           |\n\n98 Classroom Visits across 23 partner classrooms delivered.\n\n608 Students positively impacted.\n\nAllison Huckins, Abbott STEM intern.\nCompensation and Benefits\n\nOur compensation and benefits programs are designed to enable our employees to build financial security and to provide for the health and well-being of themselves and their families.\n\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH\nAbbott compensates employees based on the work they do, regardless of race, ethnicity or gender. We are committed to equal pay for equal work, and do not tolerate discrimination in pay, as stated in our position statement on human rights. Three concepts guide development of consistent, fair compensation:\n\n\u2022 Base salaries and benefits are based on, and competitive in, the markets where we compete for talent\n\u2022 Annual and long-term incentives are linked to business and individual performance, with a balance of short- and long-term financial and strategic objectives\n\u2022 Compensation encourages behavior consistent with the ethical values in Abbott\u2019s Code of Business Conduct\n\nOur leadership covenant specifically states that senior leaders are accountable for the achievement of Abbott\u2019s 2030 Sustainability Plan goals. Any corporate officer that does not fulfill the covenant can receive a reduction of up to 100% of their annual incentive and/or long-term incentive awards.\n\nA Stake in Abbott\nHelping employees build an ownership stake in Abbott is key to our philosophy. Several programs facilitate this:\n\n\u2022 Global long-term incentive program: grants restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees, generally beginning at the manager level. Paid out in shares of Abbott common stock (except in countries that require cash payment).\n\u2022 401(k) program: offers employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico a 5% match for employee contributions of 2% or more. Employees can choose from a range of investments, including company stock.\n\u2022 Employees Stock Purchase Plan: offers employees (excluding corporate officers) in most countries outside the U.S. stock at a discounted price.\n\nEnabling Financial Freedom\nOur first-of-its-kind Freedom 2 Save program helps U.S. employees save for retirement while repaying student loans. Employees who put at least 2% of eligible pay toward repayments receive a 5% 401(k) contribution from Abbott. More than 1,400 employees have enrolled, with Abbott contributing over $3.5 million dollars to their accounts.\n\nFor retirement-eligible employees, Freedom to Work supports reduced schedules, workloads and/or responsibilities while allowing employees to continue building retirement income. Over 1,800 employees have enrolled since 2008.\n\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\nIn 2021, Abbott granted RSUs to 13,199 employees across 71 countries, while more than 18,000 employees in 60 countries participated in our Employees Stock Purchase Plan.\n\nSupporting Financial Independence\nA new college loan repayment program in the Netherlands is helping more employees achieve financial independence. Eligible employees can receive reimbursement from Abbott of \u20ac1,200 annually, up to a total of 50% of post-graduation balance.\n\nEnabling Further Education with FreeU\nWe know financial considerations can represent a barrier to further education. In 2021, we launched FreeU that, when combined with our tuition reimbursement program, enables employees to pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree at no personal cost. This program underscores Abbott\u2019s commitment to \u2014 and belief in \u2014 developing our people so they can pursue rewarding careers.\n\nAbbott pays the full cost of required starting coursework. Credits are then automatically transferred to a participating online university where employees can complete their studies.\n\nEmployees have access to free classes on topics like time management and study skills plus 10 hours of personal tutoring annually. Success coaches support participants to plan and achieve academic goals while access to MyTimeEnglish helps non-native English speakers develop the language skills needed to complete assignments.\n\n137 people enrolled in the FreeU program in the six months that followed its launch.\n\nAnthony Ashford is pursuing a degree in business management with the support of Abbott\u2019s FreeU program.\nEmployee Well-Being\n\nEmployee well-being matters, and we are fully committed to protecting it. We offer programs that support work-life harmony and promote good health, with many available to employees\u2019 families as well.\n\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH\n\nWe recognize that, to feel and perform at their best, employees must be able to balance work and family responsibilities. During the pandemic, we recognized that the way we work was going to change. So, building upon our long-standing practice of flexibility, we made changes to support these trends, offering eligible employees enhanced opportunities to benefit from options like flextime, compressed work weeks, reduced schedules, job sharing and remote working. We also made changes to our U.S. vacation policy to offer employees more weeks of paid time off earlier in their careers.\n\nIn the U.S., on-site child care, discounts on external child care, and parenting and counseling services are provided. New parents are offered eight weeks\u2019 paid leave, and since 2015, we have given financial support for adoption of up to $20,000 per child.\n\nOur company-funded Employee Assistance Program (EAP) provides free expert mental health support for employees and their families through one-on-one assistance, seminars, online courses, crisis intervention services and workplace emergency response.\n\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\n\nSupporting Every Employee\n\nWe want as many of our people as possible to benefit from well-being services. In 2021, we expanded our EAP to the Czech Republic, Slovakia, South Africa and Vietnam, reaching more employees with mental health support. This builds on the more than 20 countries we introduced the EAP to in 2020 and brings the total program presence to more than 50 countries.\n\nThousands of employees participated in wellness sessions, including a webinar on reducing stress, overcoming burnout, enhancing relationships and creating work-life balance, and a live meditation session. In honor of World Mental Health Day in October, we offered employees across the world three mental health awareness webinars.\n\nIn India, the second wave of COVID-19 presented a difficult situation with the average daily case numbers peaking above 300,000. This led to a scarcity of oxygen, medicines, hospital beds, ventilators and access to doctors and a medical infrastructure stretched beyond capacity. Our team in India mobilized resources to build a regional task force and a comprehensive program for employees and their families. They delivered support to employees that included telemedicine and home COVID-19 management; robust employee communications and support; oxygen concentrators for employee usage and vaccinations for all employees.\n\nEmployee well-being matters, and we are fully committed to protecting it. We offer programs that support work-life harmony and promote good health, with many available to employees\u2019 families as well.\n\nA Globally Recognized Commitment to Our Employees\n\nWe prioritize well-being because we care about our employees. While not motivated by external recognition, we are proud to have been featured in several global indices for our efforts throughout 2021.\n\n- Great Place to Work certified (U.S., U.K., Brazil, Costa Rica)\n- Fortune Best Workplaces in Health Care and Best Big Companies to Work For\n- Seramount 100 Best Company\n- Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption Best Adoption-Friendly Workplace\n- Science magazine Top Employer\n- Certified Top Employer by Top Employers Institute in six EU and three Middle East countries\nEmployee Health and Safety\n\nThe health and safety of our employees and contract workers is paramount for Abbott. Through an integrated Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) management system and a dedicated EHS Leadership Council, we are embedding a culture of safety across every area of our business.\n\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH\n\nOur EHS Leadership Council governs the EHS organization. It comprises professionals who manage internal programs across 90 manufacturing sites, and commercial professionals who support field-based teams, offices and warehouses in more than 90 countries. The commercial EHS organization is divided across six regions, each with a dedicated manager. At each Abbott site, designated safety representatives and safety teams help ensure the successful implementation of our internal programs.\n\nWe maintain global policies and standards for managing employee health and safety. Experts regularly update these to reflect changes in regulations and global expectations. Similar standards extend to contractors working at Abbott locations. Each site must comply with robust contractor EHS management programs, including:\n\n- Training for Abbott employees responsible for contractor activities\n- An EHS approval process for contractor companies\n- Orientations for contractor employees\n- EHS plans for projects over $2 million\n- A full-time safety representative on large construction projects\n- Inspections of contractor activity\n- Contractor completion of Job Hazard Analyses or Risk Assessment and Method Statements\n- Evaluation of contractor company\u2019s EHS performance\n\nSenior leadership uses EHS scorecards to monitor performance. We communicate results across our organization, identifying necessary corrective actions and ensuring actions are completed on time. A separate Global Health Scorecard is used by site and divisional leaders to track implementation of occupational health and well-being initiatives. Each site is required to improve its score annually.\n\nOccupational Health Services\n\nOur global Occupational Health Services (OHS) team \u2014 part of the EHS organization \u2014 develops and maintains occupational health (OH) policies, procedures and guidelines, trains relevant employees and consults on regulatory compliance. Together with the EHS team, they lead our response to public health emergencies with the potential to impact our business, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis team is also responsible for implementing our global employee health and productivity strategy, tracking progress against key performance indicators (KPIs) and identifying improvement opportunities. To support this, we have developed our Occupational Health Services Standard, requiring facilities to provide adequate resources and designated healthcare professionals with site-specific knowledge. Today, over 130 OH professionals support employee health and well-being, treat illnesses and injuries, and maintain employee medical records. They conduct regular screenings and health education programs to identify and minimize occupational risks.\n\nOur Reproductive Hazard Management Standard ensures the health and safety of employees and their potential future children. We also use established external standards and certifications to drive continuous improvement. At the end of 2021, 22 Abbott sites were certified to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 45001.\nFostering a Health and Safety Culture\n\nTo build a robust health and safety culture, we must engage everyone at Abbott \u2014 something we achieve and maintain through our EHS policy and several technical and management standards, including:\n\n- **Risk Assessment and Self-Assessment Management Standard**: requirements for assessing and mitigating health and safety risks\n- **Training and Awareness Management Standard**: requirements for employees to be aware of health and safety risks and have knowledge of job-specific hazards\n- **Area-specific technical standards**: e.g., Fleet Safety, Control of Hazardous Energy, Confined Spaces, Ergonomics, Electrical Safety, Biological Safety and Working at Heights\n- **Emergency Preparedness Standard**: requirements for emergency preparedness planning and minimum requirements to ensure health and safety on-site and in surrounding communities. Includes:\n  - Detailed site descriptions and hazardous chemical lists\n  - Identifying potential emergencies and required responses\n  - Clearly marked emergency response equipment\n  - Designating an emergency coordinator and response team\n  - Procedures for reporting emergencies and site evacuations\n  - Employee and Emergency Response team training\n  - Annual procedure reviews\n\nA full list of EHS management and technical standards is available online.\n\n**OUR 2021 PERFORMANCE**\n\nThroughout 2020, we achieved a significant improvement in our lost-time case rate, partially the result of increased working at home during the pandemic. However, each division also implemented initiatives to drive improvement. These include ongoing driver safety initiatives and multiple ergonomic projects. Our 2021 lost-time case rate has remained consistent with what we achieved in 2020, even as operational activity and on-site working returned to pre-pandemic levels at certain facilities. We are also happy to report that Abbott experienced no fatalities among our employees or contractors in 2021.\n\n**Increasingly Robust Standards**\n\nOur teams have worked to increase understanding of workplace health and safety issues, updating our protocols to safeguard against occupational injuries and illness. We refreshed our internal ergonomic technical standard to more thoroughly address the leading causes of illness and injuries. Additionally, increased focus was placed on creating a global task force on lockout/tagout control of hazardous energy, a step that will help ensure enhanced safety procedures are followed when servicing machinery.\n\n**A Global Safe-Driving Program**\n\nOur safe-driving program reduces vehicle accidents across Abbott. In Latin America, a new driver risk assessment covers driver profile, driving behaviors and knowledge of local traffic regulations. This information will help us develop trainings targeted to drivers\u2019 specific risk level. In India, our commercial EHS team is developing a vehicle safety initiative focused on two-wheelers to reduce crash-related injuries.\n\n**Continuing to Keep People Healthy During COVID-19**\n\nThroughout 2021, we have maintained robust on-site cleaning procedures and continued to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) to those who require it. To keep employees healthy we offered on-site testing and vaccine clinics in certain locations.\n\nIn the U.S., we regularly test employees and contractors directly involved in manufacturing our COVID-19 tests, and have expanded this testing to other facilities and offices across the U.S. and at our facilities in other countries as well. This ambitious employee testing program has resulted in more than 3 million tests performed globally since the start of the employee and contractor testing. We have also developed guidelines on traveling, returning to work and case management to reduce transmission risks.\n\nWhile social distancing, wearing a mask, frequent hand washing, and asking that employees stay home (with pay) if they feel ill or show symptoms are all critical steps to maintaining a healthy work environment, our program of regular testing gave our employees additional peace of mind as they returned to the office. Measures have been introduced on a site-by-site basis, timed to align with country-specific regulatory developments.\n\n**OHS Performance**\n\nAbbott senior leadership regularly reviews OHS data to help ensure continuous improvement in this area.\n\n**Lost-Time Case Rate**\n\n| Year | Employee and Contractor |\n|------|-------------------------|\n| 2021 | 0.12                    |\n| 2020 | 0.13                    |\n| 2019 | 0.30                    |\n| 2018 | 0.24                    |\n\n**Vehicle Accidents per Million Miles**\n\n| Year | Employees |\n|------|-----------|\n| 2021 | 2.61      |\n| 2020 | 2.7       |\n| 2019 | 3.9       |\n| 2018 | 4.1       |\n\n**Recordable Case Rate**\n\n| Year | Employees |\n|------|-----------|\n| 2021 | 0.29      |\n| 2020 | 0.28      |\n| 2019 | 0.46      |\n| 2018 | 0.41      |\nWe are champions for health. This means developing products and technologies that change people\u2019s lives. It also means protecting the planet that supports every living thing.\n\nAs global temperatures increase, one of the most pressing issues is the growing scarcity of clean, safe water. In Spain, we completed the installation of a second reverse osmosis (RO) system to minimize water use, safeguarding potable sources for the people whose quality of life relies on them.\n\n**INITIATIVE SPOTLIGHT**\n\n- **8M GALLONS** of water saved annually\n- **12,800 kWh** less energy needed to run water wells\n- **3.7 METRIC TONS** CO\u2082e associated emission savings\nOur Approach to Environmental Protection\n\nSafeguarding the environment must be a priority for Abbott if we are to help people around the world live healthier, fuller lives. Evolving our operations to reduce our environmental footprint will also help us build a more resilient business for the long term.\n\nEnvironmental Impact Projects\n\nEvery year, our sites establish and advance projects tailored to address the unique requirements of each region to reduce environmental impacts. By developing our facilities for environmental efficiency, we can also achieve significant financial savings.\n\n- 71 projects completed\n- 38 sites across 15 countries\n- 6.6 million kWh annual energy savings and 1,700 metric tons CO2e emissions reduced annually\n- 18.7 million gallons of water saved annually\n- 457 U.S. tons of waste eliminated annually\n- $990,000 annual savings\n\nFor specific information on our 2030 goals around Environmental Protection, see page 13.\nEnvironmental Governance\n\nAbbott operations are present around the world. A clearly defined, robust governance structure ensures the environmental impact of these facilities is as positive as possible.\n\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH\n\nEnvironmental governance and management fall under our Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) approach, led by our Board of Directors and senior management. Our EHS organization reports to the Senior Vice President, Quality Assurance, Regulatory and Engineering Services who, in turn, reports to our Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The Senior Vice President is also the executive sponsor for the development of our climate and water strategy.\n\nPolicies and Management Systems\n\nOur policies and standards are updated regularly to reflect best practices, regulatory trends and requirements. A comprehensive audit program monitors compliance and identifies potential risks to our business and employees.\n\nWe evaluate EHS risk factors for each site annually, using insights to determine audit frequency. Following audits, corrective action plans are developed, implemented and monitored where needed.\n\nEnvironmental and Ecosystem Protection\n\nProtecting biodiversity and ecosystems is key to environmental management. Abbott maintains technical standards for preventing unpermitted environmental releases that facilities must comply with alongside relevant external regulations. Many sites have implemented protective measures, including processes to safeguard soil and groundwater, protect and restore wetlands and prairies, and remove invasive species.\n\nMergers and Acquisitions\n\nOur EHS policy requires that EHS liability and compliance evaluations are conducted prior to all property and business acquisitions and divestitures. Compliance with our EHS policy is also incorporated into all new acquisitions. The type of due diligence we undertake depends on the nature of the transaction:\n\n- **Real property transactions:** Environmental due diligence is conducted to evaluate potential environmental risks and liabilities associated with real property acquisitions and divestitures.\n- **Business acquisitions:** In conjunction with environmental due diligence, a company\u2019s EHS resources and programs are assessed, gaps identified and resources estimated to align with regulatory requirements and Abbott standards.\n\nAbbott develops multi-year integration plans to ensure acquisitions align with our EHS management practices and standards. This includes providing training and resources to enable implementation of our EHS policy. Progress against integration plans is monitored to help ensure their ongoing efficacy. The final step in integration plans is often an internal EHS compliance audit to ensure acquired businesses are fully aligned.\n\nEngaging Employees in Our Efforts\n\nAll EHS employees receive training on our standards and changing regulatory requirements. We maintain several employee engagement initiatives, including:\n\n- Evaluating EHS leaders against performance goals in annual reviews\n- Raising awareness of priority EHS issues through dedicated discussion forums\n- Recognizing exceptional performance through our annual EHS Awards Program\n\nAll EHS policies and standards are available online. Read more about our strategy on page 38.\nEnergy and Emissions\n\nWe are committed to safeguarding a healthier planet for everyone. One way we do this is by reducing our emissions, finding more efficient ways to use energy and limiting reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nOUR IMPACT\n\nWe realize our emissions contribute to global climate change. Our operational activities produce Scope 1 (direct) and 2 (indirect) emissions. Emissions from activities like business travel, waste disposal, raw material sourcing and processing, and product distribution, packaging and disposal \u2014 collectively known as Scope 3 emissions \u2014 also contribute to our footprint.\n\nWe\u2019re working to reduce the negative impacts of our emissions by investing in renewable energy, reducing fleet fuel consumption, increasing manufacturing efficiency and partnering with suppliers.\n\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH\n\nWe maintain a robust program for recording and reducing energy and air emissions, outlined in both our Climate Responsible Energy Policy and Internal Energy Guidelines. Along with these documents, our Global EHS Governance team provides guidance on:\n\n- Energy efficiency in manufacturing operations\n- Low-carbon energy investments\n- Transportation fleet efficiency\n- Supply chain carbon footprint\n- Public reporting of our performance\n\nWe align with international frameworks \u2014 including CDP and the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol \u2014 to measure, track, reduce and report emissions.\n\n---\n\n11 Scope 1 emissions result from owned and controlled sources. Scope 2 emissions are produced during generation of purchased electricity and energy.\nA Holistic Plan for Reductions\n\nWe are committed to supporting the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) objective. By 2030, we plan to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30%12 (vs. 2018).\n\nWe have established a comprehensive program for reducing these emissions, including measures to advance:\n\n- Operational energy efficiency, driving reductions in energy demands\n- Purchase of renewable energy\n- Electrification of industrial processes, spaces and fleets\n- Conversion to cleaner fuel options\n- Integration of sustainable engineering technologies and concepts into projects\n\nEach Abbott business sets individual annual energy efficiency targets. Manufacturing sites that produce over 25,000 metric tons of CO2e annually are required to set additional carbon reduction goals.\n\nOur Scope 3 emissions constitute around 93% of total emissions. We calculate them annually using the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard, referring to the 10 Scope 3 categories* that apply to Abbott (see Our Carbon Footprint infographic).\n\nWe\u2019re currently developing a quantitative target for Scope 3 emissions. This will include working with key carbon-intensive suppliers on emission reduction solutions. Read more about supply chain efforts on page 62.\n\nWe have our data assured every year. All Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as Scope 3 emissions related to business travel and operational waste production, are verified through a third-party assurance process. Our latest assurance statement is available on our Environmental Policy page.\n\nRegulated Air Emissions\n\nThe production of some Abbott products involves substances that are ozone-depleting or classified as hazardous or toxic air pollutants (HAPs) by local environmental protection agencies. We require all Abbott facilities using these substances to take all necessary steps to ensure the protection of human health and the environment. This includes adhering to all applicable regulations, as well as to Abbott technical standards.\n\nOur Supplier Guidelines establish that the same standards are expected of all Abbott suppliers.\n\n---\n\n12 Target expected to be validated by SBTi in 2022. 2030 targets will be measured in terms of CO2e emissions. They will include all GHG emissions covered by the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG) methodology for GHG reporting.\n\n* Transportation and Distribution includes Upstream and Downstream.\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\n\nThroughout 2021, absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions production increased by 3.3% compared to 2020. When adjusted for sales, Scope 1 and 2 emissions decreased 17% over this same time period. In 2021, as our products \u2014 including COVID-19 testing and diagnostics \u2014 became increasingly important for patients and healthcare workers globally, we expanded production, which has come with a rise in emissions. As we move forward, we continue to identify ways to reduce our carbon footprint year-on-year to achieve our 2030 goal.\n\nA More Energy-Efficient Global Operation\n\nTo reduce energy demand, we have made several operational energy-efficient improvements as retrofits to existing equipment or through active and efficient in-house energy management. Several sites use energy data and innovative methods to identify and quantify energy inefficiencies in manufacturing processes, often employing external experts. These insights then inform a list of priority energy demand reduction projects across the global business.\n\nFor example, in Indonesia, many of our motors have been upgraded with variable speed drives, reducing energy requirements while retaining performance.\n\nOur manufacturing site in Singapore achieved an 8% CO\u2082 emissions intensity reduction in 2021 even with an 11% increase in volume, through initiatives pioneered by our Utilities Excellence team. More than 200 metric tons CO\u2082e annual reduction were realized by installing a boiler oxygen management system in our three steam boilers. This increased boiler efficiency by 3%, by controlling excess oxygen and fuel ratio to increase percentage of complete combustion. Another project to upgrade cooling-tower fins, louvres and in-fills resulted in an annual reduction of about 250 metric tons CO\u2082e.\n\nTo reduce safety and supply chain risk, one of our facilities in Peru switched from using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to feed the boilers, kitchen and laboratory workstations to instead supply with natural gas. This switch also resulted in a financial saving, plus an environmental benefit of an annual GHG emission reduction of about 20 metric tons.\n\nPowering Our Facilities Renewably\n\nWe are committed to purchasing a greater proportion of electricity from renewable sources and are developing a Renewable Energy Procurement initiative to drive continuous improvement in this area. In 2021, we purchased 190 million kWh of low-carbon and renewable energy, resulting in savings of 80,000 metric tons of CO\u2082e. In addition, we also generated 1.8 million kWh from solar installations at eight of our sites.\n\nIncreasingly Green Transport\n\nWe have established a range of initiatives to manage fuel consumption in our commercial fleet as well as the fuel consumption during employee commuting. These include establishing increasingly robust requirements for vehicle fuel efficiency, providing on-site electric vehicle charging stations, promoting car-sharing and, where possible, public transportation use.\n\nBringing Greater Clarity to Scope 3 Emissions\n\nTo expand understanding of Scope 3 emissions, we partnered with an external consultant to update our calculation methodology. This included assessing our supplier-affiliated Scope 3 categories to identify priority sourcing categories for transitioning to an average-data calculation method.13 Through the exercise, we have updated the emission calculation methodology for 47% of our carbon-intensive categories, resulting in a more accurate, representative 2020 Scope 3 baseline recalculations.\n\nSee page 93 for a detailed breakdown of our emissions and energy metrics.\n\nLighting Our Facilities Sustainably\n\nUpgrading sites to LED lighting is one of the ways we are mitigating CO\u2082e emissions. In 2021, several facilities made the switch to LEDs throughout the year, most notably our site in South Carolina, where approximately 240 light fixtures were upgraded across the various production areas. Taken together, this switch will result in annual financial savings of over $16,500 and energy savings of over 187,100 kWh.\n\n5% ABSOLUTE REDUCTION\n\nin Scope 1 and 2 emissions (vs. 2018)\n\n17% REDUCTION\n\nin Scope 1 and 2 emissions (vs. 2020, normalized to sales)\n\n13 A method that estimates emissions for goods and services based on the mass or other relevant units of goods and services purchased multiplied by relevant secondary emission factors.\nProtecting Water Resources\n\nWe recognize the importance of water in sustaining life, human health, economic growth and ecosystems. Water also plays a critical role in our business continuity, manufacturing operations and product use. As such, we are committed to managing our water use efficiently and responsibly, contributing toward the goal of facilitating access to good quality water in the communities where we operate.\n\nOUR IMPACT\n\nWherever we use and discharge water we work to minimize the impact we have on the quality and quantity of local sources. We establish initiatives that address the most pressing local needs \u2014 whether that\u2019s quality, quantity or other concerns for those who rely on this precious natural resource.\n\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH\n\nOur Water Footprint\n\nWe perform an annual mapping process to understand where the water we use comes from, how it is treated and discharged, and the impacts our operations have on local basins. Most of our sites discharge water to municipal treatment plants before release to the environment. Those that treat water on-site and discharge it directly to the environment are required to meet relevant local regulations. Where possible, we reduce withdrawals by recycling and reusing water. Since 2017, we have measured how much water is recycled on-site and how it is recycled or reused.\n\n14 We define water recycling as the act of processing used water and wastewater through an additional operating cycle(s) before treatment and discharge.\n\nOUR 2021 WATER FOOTPRINT\n\n77.5% Municipal water\n0.2% Rainwater collected on-site\n17.5% Water consumed in process\n70.0% Water treated by municipality\n12.5% Water returned to environment\n22.3% Fresh surface and groundwater\n<0.01% Water from raw materials\n8.01% On-site recycled water is used for facility applications and not in product\n1.01% Water consumed in process\n17.5% Water consumed in process\n70.0% Water treated by municipality\n12.5% Water returned to environment\n22.3% Fresh surface and groundwater\n<0.01% Water from raw materials\n8.01% On-site recycled water is used for facility applications and not in product\n1.01% Water consumed in process\nTailoring Our Management Approach\n\nAs a member of the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) and with the support of World Resources Institute (WRI) resources, we have developed a comprehensive approach to water management, tailoring how we mitigate risks and ensure business continuity to local circumstances.\n\nOur process centers around four principles:\n\n- **Reduce**: continuously work to improve water use efficiency in our operations\n- **Prevent**: manage water discharges that could adversely impact human health or the environment\n- **Engage**: develop and apply key water management principles and best practices across our company\n- **Educate**: emphasize to our employees and suppliers the importance of protecting groundwater and other water resources vulnerable to overuse or contamination, and the role they play in doing so\n\nThese principles are communicated through our Position Statement on Access to Clean Water and internal Water Use Guidelines.\n\nManaging Water Risks\n\nOur water management technical standard helps monitor Abbott\u2019s impact on resources in communities where we operate. Any manufacturing or research and development (R&D) site with high water-use requirements \u2014 as well as those in water-stressed areas \u2014 must implement management plans and targets for mitigating risks.\n\nSignificant water users must also engage key local stakeholders to fully understand water-related risks.\n\nAbbott sites are evaluated annually for resilience, using WRI Aqueduct\u2122 \u2014 a global water-risk mapping tool \u2014 to analyze local water stress and evaluate against our internal water use intensity. The assessment also highlights our company-wide level of risk and, today, shows our overall exposure to chronic physical risks is limited.\n\nRead more about how we manage water risks in our CDP Water Disclosure Response.\n\n---\n\n15 Water use of over 50 million gallons per year.\nIn one of our U.S. nutrition plants, our Energy Center operators identified a solution that could save millions of gallons of soft water from being sent down the drain each year.\n\nThe operator noticed that condensate probes in our cooling systems required a constant water supply to bring temperatures down to a registerable range. In response, work is now underway to replace the probes with alternatives that can withstand higher temperatures of steam condensate, eliminating the need for cooling water.\n\nThe first phase of the project will save the site approximately 3.2 million gallons of soft water and 106,000 gallons of make-up water. We received capital project funds to complete a second phase, adding six additional high-temperature probes to our system. These new probes will allow continuous monitoring of our six largest condensate return legs, saving an estimated additional 200,000 gallons of make-up water per year with annual savings of $2,800.\n\nOverall, the improvements will save the site approximately 3.5 million gallons of water per year, a 2% reduction in water intake. The overall economic impact of both phases of the project totals $27,000 in annual savings.\n\n**OUR 2021 PERFORMANCE**\n\nFoundational elements have been set to support future water stewardship certification and management practices.\n\n**Water Stewardship Certification**\n\nWe aim to achieve water stewardship certification at all high water impact manufacturing sites in water-stressed regions. In 2021, 25 of our manufacturing sites were identified as operating in areas of water stress. Of those, 48% used less than 15 million gallons of water while nine sites were deemed high impact considering basin water stress, basin water depletion level and water usage. Aligned with our context-based approach and based on the potential for these sites to significantly impact local communities, we have targeted them for AWS water stewardship certification. Alignment with the standard is intended to achieve five main outcomes:\n\n- Good water governance\n- Sustainable water balance\n- Good water quality status\n- Important water-related areas\n- Safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)\n\nWe have established a Community of Practice for our nine High Water Impact Sites to support progress toward AWS water stewardship certification. Strategic roadmaps highlight key steps for achieving certification.\n\n**Water Stewardship Management Practices**\n\nWe will implement accredited water stewardship management practices in more than 75% of all manufacturing sites operating in water-stressed regions by 2030. In 2021, we set this in motion for 16 sites identified as being in water-stressed areas not classified as being high water impact. While these sites have less impact than our high water impact facilities, it is also important for them to adopt water stewardship practices that support achievement of the outcomes described above.\n\nDraft accredited water stewardship practices are currently under expert review. They will be finalized in 2022 alongside a supporting guidance document. The new Community of Practice will help sites stay on track through quarterly reporting and act as a resource for shared learning between facilities.\n\n**Water-Saving Solutions**\n\nTotal water intake in 2021 rose by approximately 4% versus the previous year \u2014 a result of increased production in 2021. When adjusted for sales, water intake decreased 16% compared to 2020. Nonetheless, we continually look for ways to reduce absolute withdrawals \u2014 with a particular focus on those facilities in water-stressed areas. In Minnesota, low-flow faucets and fixtures have been installed, saving the site 73,000 gallons in a single year. In Costa Rica, we are reducing reliance on groundwater by harvesting rainwater and reusing water from our cooling towers in the site toilets and irrigation system.\n\nOur efforts in Spain \u2014 where we operate in a water-stressed area \u2014 are even more substantial. We have achieved significant reductions in both water use and wastewater production by installing a second RO water purification system. By increasing capacity to recover and treat 70% of water rejected by the first RO system, across 2020 and 2021 we saved over 8 million gallons of water. Additionally, by reducing well water consumption by 11%, the site has also achieved notable energy savings of 12,800 kWh every year \u2014 and avoided approximately 3.7 metric tons of CO2e.\n\nRead more about our emission reductions on page 43.\n\n**Identifying Supply Chain Focus Points**\n\nIn addition to addressing direct water impacts, by 2030 we aim to work with 50 key suppliers in high water-stressed areas to reduce quality and quantity risks in our supply chain. In 2021, we performed an assessment to identify key suppliers to further engage on efforts. Read more about this on page 72.\n\nAdditional details of 2021 water stewardship efforts are available in our latest CDP Water response. See page 104 for a detailed breakdown of our water metrics.\nWaste Management\n\nEach stage of a product\u2019s life cycle has potential impacts on human health and the environment \u2014 from how materials are harvested to how final products and services are consumed. We believe waste management responsibility extends beyond the manufacturing phase and we are committed to staying accountable for impacts at each point of a product\u2019s journey.\n\nOUR IMPACT\n\nIf not carefully managed, raw material extraction depletes natural resources, while waste production and use of potentially hazardous chemicals present contamination risks. We maintain a robust approach to managing and reducing our waste footprint. At the same time, we ensure everyone at Abbott responsible for working with waste in manufacturing is trained in handling materials safely and mitigating negative impacts.\n\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH\n\nOur responsibility for the impact of our products and services extends throughout the entire life cycle.\n\n- **Procurement**\n  We ensure operational inputs \u2014 e.g., raw materials, processed goods and services \u2014 are procured ethically and sustainably.\n\n- **Design, Production and Distribution**\n  We consider the environmental and social impacts of how we produce and deliver our products.\n\n- **Consumption**\n  We ensure products can be consumed and disposed of in environmentally responsible ways.\n\nOur Operational Waste Footprint\n\nResponsible handling the waste we create is a central tenet of Abbott\u2019s commitment to extended waste management responsibility. Our ultimate aim is to \u201cdesign out\u201d waste and minimize consumption of raw materials. We are working to extract additional value from waste and materials through processes such as incineration for energy, recycling and beneficial use.16 Mapping our operational waste footprint brings greater clarity to what we have achieved to date and where we need to improve.\n\n---\n\n16 Abbott defines beneficial-use activities as sending material that otherwise would have been sent off-site to be used as an effective substitute for a commercial product or commodity. Beneficial-use material is used as is or in substantially the same form as it was generated.\nClosing the Loop on Operational Waste\n\nBy 2030, we plan to implement a circular economy approach to reduce waste, aiming to achieve and maintain at least a 90% waste diversion rate. In 2021, we reached an 88.5% rate by diverting 61% of materials to beneficial use, and a further 27.6% away from incineration without energy recovery and landfill.\n\nTo keep resources in use for as long as possible, we are designing for sustainability, eliminating material use and reducing how much we send to landfill every year. We are committed to finding responsible and economical ways to reduce the volume of waste we produce and ensure effective disposal practices. At the same time, we are innovating our processes to maximize resource recovery.\n\nThe standard governing of our practices applies to both hazardous and nonhazardous waste, as well as our beneficial-use activities. It specifies a range of waste management strategies, including:\n\n- Preventive maintenance and process design to eliminate waste generation\n- Process waste reduction through diagnosing and fixing problems that would otherwise result in waste generation\n- Reducing waste through product design, material input and purchasing decisions\n- Partnering across other value chains to promote beneficial use\n- Ensuring proper waste material segregation\n- Recycling and incinerating with energy recovery\n\nWorking to Close the Loop on Waste\n\nBy 2030, we plan to implement a circular economy approach to reduce waste, aiming to achieve and maintain at least a 90% waste diversion rate.

The waste management standard we follow details requirements for storing, segregating, labeling and documenting hazardous and chemical waste, and for decontaminating biohazardous waste prior to final disposal. It also requires that all Abbott employees and contract workers who work with waste complete annual training before undertaking responsibility for hazardous waste management. Manufacturing sites that produce over 1,200 kilograms of hazardous waste annually require audits of waste management firms at least every five years. This is guided by our Waste Vendor Assessment program.\n\nWe are committed to developing and tracking waste diversion initiatives for key suppliers too. Read more about this on page 73.\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\n\nWaste production did increase in 2021 due to increased production, as well as a rise in construction waste from expansion projects to allow for production growth. When adjusted for sales, waste production decreased 8.6% versus 2020. We continue to identify opportunities to divert materials from landfill, and advance the Zero Waste-to-Landfill initiative we launched in 2012. In 2021, seven manufacturing facilities and one non-manufacturing facility received Zero Waste-to-Landfill certification, bringing our total number of facilities certified through this program to 38 manufacturing and eight non-manufacturing facilities.\n\nOne of our facilities in Norway developed a great cross-functional Waste Management team that is very active. The site demonstrated the following key elements of a successful waste management program:\n\n- Senior Leadership buy-in and site-level support of the program\n- Clear lines of responsibility for waste management, including ongoing communications on waste management performance\n- Initial and ongoing training and supporting Standard Operating Procedure for waste management\n- Excellent recordkeeping and interaction with current vendor to allow for higher levels of waste management\n- Ongoing site-wide communications on waste management performance\n- Proactive program that continues to focus on capturing more value from waste\n- At the time of audit, the site was maintaining a diversion rate of 100% (no waste sent to landfill or incineration without energy) thus effectively capturing value from waste\n\nEach facility tailors waste management initiatives to address its most pressing issues, following the principles of reduce, reuse and recycle.\n\nReduce\nAt both the Abbott Park corporate headquarters and Core Diagnostics operations in Illinois, we started an initiative in March 2021 to reduce waste generation from these sites by sending baled corrugated cardboard to a third party for beneficial use. The cardboard is used as cellulose insulation for homes and commercial buildings. While pushing the management of this material further up the waste hierarchy increased our overall costs rather than providing cost savings, it resulted in a waste reduction of nearly 200 U.S. tons (193.5 U.S. tons) for these locations in 2021. We are continuing this initiative after 2021 and project over 200 U.S. tons of baled corrugated cardboard will be sent to the third party for beneficial use every year going forward.\n\nReuse\nIn Costa Rica, our team is finding ways to reuse Gaylord shipping containers, cutting both waste production and costs associated with product distribution. For health and safety purposes, containers have historically been used once. However, our studies found that, with proper sterilization methods, each container could be used twice before being disposed of. The team is now in the process of transitioning to multi-use, updating procedures for handling the shipping containers and assessing their condition prior to reuse.\n\nRecycle\nIn one of our U.S. nutrition plants, prior to COVID-19, fiber drums were sent to an external partner for beneficial reuse (resale). During the pandemic, these vendor activities slowed, resulting in the accumulation of fiber drums at our on-site Recycle Center. In response, we invested in a dechimer machine to break drums down into their cardboard and metal components so each can be recycled. In 2021, about 13.7 U.S. tons of fiber drums were processed by the dechimer, and this investment prevented surplus drums from being sent for incineration. In addition, now that fiber drums are back to being sent to an external partner for beneficial use, we are still using the dechimer to break down lower-quality drums that the vendor cannot take, which will result in an estimated 4.8 U.S. tons per year increase in recycling, and corresponding decrease in incineration, of fiber drums.\n\nSee page 107 for a detailed breakdown of our waste metrics.\nPackaging\n\nPackaging is key to ensuring our life-saving solutions are delivered safely to those who need them. To achieve our 2030 goals, we continually assess our design and manufacturing processes, identifying novel ways to develop packaging solutions that protect both their contents and the planet.\n\nOUR IMPACT\n\nWe recognize the impact our packaging has on the environment in the form of resource use, related emissions and waste production. We are rethinking how we design packaging to optimize material use and keep materials in circulation for as long as possible. To reduce our raw material burden, we are optimizing efficiency by minimizing the volume and weight of our packaging. We are also employing circularity principles to incorporate increased quantities of recycled content and designing for recyclability, reusability and increasingly positive impact.\n\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH\n\nWe want to design our packaging with sustainability in mind. Many Abbott functions collaborate to help ensure sustainability considerations are prioritized during product and packaging design and manufacture. Each division has provided projections for the next decade of packaging projects. Our Sustainable Packaging Council has designed a database for reporting progress against these projections, supporting more efficient tracking of our target.\n\nGuiding Principles of Sustainable Packaging\n\nTo address 50 million pounds of packaging through high-impact sustainable design programs, we need a plan of action. Our Sustainable Packaging Guiding Principles \u2014 recently created by the Sustainable Packaging Council \u2014 inform changes to existing packaging and target new designs that integrate sustainability from the very beginning.\n\nThe Sustainable Packaging Guiding Principles are:\n\n- **Optimize Material Efficiency**\n  - Eliminate unnecessary components\n  - Reduce packaging materials\n\n- **Employ Circularity Principles**\n  - Replace problematic materials\n  - Design for disassembly\n  - Design for recyclability\n  - Design for reuse\n  - Utilize renewable materials\n  - Integrate recycled content\n\n- **Balance All Aspects of Packaging Systems Holistically**\n  - Optimize cube efficiency\n  - Provide consumer direction\n  - Improve carbon footprint\n\nWorking With Suppliers\n\nWe\u2019re working with suppliers to create lower impact packaging that supports our circular economy approach. Together, we identify solutions that either eliminate packaging materials supplied to us or ensure those we do receive can be reused in manufacturing processes. This includes optimizing design to reduce material use \u2014 particularly plastics \u2014 improving shipping efficiencies, increasing fiber-based packaging sustainability and introducing reusable options. We are also working to develop packaging take-back initiatives. Read more about supplier partnerships on page 72.\n\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\n\nThrough adoption and socialization of the 2030 packaging goal, a list of high-impact packaging projects was developed and prioritized, and the projected benefits quantified. Implementation of these projects will contribute to achieving our goal on time.\n\nSame Packaging, Fewer Materials\n\nOne way we\u2019re reducing our packaging footprint is by finding solutions to do more with less. We recently launched the first phase of a project to reduce plastic use in blister packaging for our acetaminophen product.\n\nThrough the project, we are reducing packaging specifications from a starting thickness of 250 micron of plastic to 220 micron. The result is a 16.2 metric ton reduction in material use with associated savings of $93,000 annually.\n\nNEARLY 300,000 pounds of packaging reduced in 2021 through optimizing material efficiency\n\nNEARLY 15,000 pounds impacted in 2021 through employing circularity principles\nOptimizing Materials Use\n\nIn 2021, several projects were implemented to reduce packaging size while retaining the same level of protection.\n\nTo increase the efficiency of our Core Diagnostics Alinity platform, engineers identified an opportunity to improve packaging design through carton size reductions for Alinity I and Alinity C products. Based on the portfolio conversion, these changes are predicted to have a 2022 sustainability impact of:\n\n- 170 fewer truckloads from Abbott manufacturing sites to the distribution center\n- 240,000 pound reduction in total carton weight\n- 56,000 pound reduction in total shipper weight\n- 270 loaded shipping containers removed from the global distribution network\n\nA similar initiative was identified for our Sigma Strong ARCHITECT Clinical Chemistry product line. By implementing more appropriately sized packaging options for assays, we have significantly increased efficiency for material use, and product transportation and storage. In 2021 alone, 3,000 pounds of packaging materials were eliminated while transport requirements were cut by 30%.\nResponsible Sourcing and Product Stewardship\n\nFor Abbott to be truly sustainable, we must consider the wider effects of our products. This is why we work with key value chain partners to address product stewardship at every step of the product life cycle.\n\nOUR IMPACT\n\nSome of our products and packaging may contain hazardous chemicals and/or conflict minerals. We continuously monitor these materials in our supply chain and operations to ensure we are complying with relevant regulations and minimizing negative outcomes. Other supply chain activities \u2014 including how raw materials are produced and transported \u2014 contribute to global emissions, waste production and animal welfare issues. We partner closely with key suppliers to identify alternative, more responsible approaches.\n\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH\n\nTo identify and mitigate the environmental impacts of our packaging and products throughout their life cycles \u2014 and at every stage of the value chain \u2014 relevant teams must work together. Our Product Stewardship, Supply Chain, R&D, Engineering and EHS groups partner closely to analyze how and what we source.\n\nStrategic sourcing initiatives are described in the Supply Chain section of this report on page 70.\n\nProduct Stewardship\n\nProduct stewardship focuses on minimizing use of hazardous chemicals and substances of concern, and carefully managing critical materials in products, packaging and manufacturing processes to ensure compliance with applicable regulations. It stretches from design through end of life, promoting a circular economy approach to our products.\n\nEach business conducts assessments of new and changed products for substances of concern, or restricted and critical materials. Risk assessments are prepared whenever these substances are identified. We then evaluate:\n\n- Whether continued use can be justified\n- The value of use versus reformulation\n- Any potential compliance issues\n\nThe evaluation also serves as an opportunity to research suitable alternatives and how they could impact product performance and cost. Recommendations for next steps contain justification for substance use, product support strategies and a business risk monitoring plan. These are all reviewed by business management.\n\nWe continuously monitor the regulatory landscape and any change to hazardous chemical requirements. Our Corporate Product Stewardship organization holds regular forums for informing all areas of our company about the potential business impacts these changes could have. Our enhanced regulatory intelligence process helps ensure potential impacts are identified in a timely manner. It also follows actions taken at the business level to confirm we remain compliant.\n\nOur product stewardship program tracks and addresses hazardous chemical legislation and supports the implementation of due diligence on conflict minerals. We offer product stewardship training on hazardous chemical legislation and conflict minerals to all relevant teams, including R&D, Supply Chain, Procurement and EHS.\n\nHazardous Chemicals and Conflict Minerals\n\nHazardous chemicals are those that pose a risk to human health and the environment. Responding to regulations on them is key to our product stewardship program and impacts how our products can be used, recycled and disposed of. We ensure the marketing and sale of our products comply with current regulations, not just those in place at the time of product development.\n\nConflict minerals include tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold \u2014 also known as 3TG minerals. We have a robust due diligence process for understanding sourcing and use of them in our products and supply chain. We file an annual Form SD18 and Conflict Minerals report each year with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (available on our website). We are a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative and use its Reporting Template to survey suppliers on conflict materials. This is supported by an automated analysis tool that assesses risk in our supply chain.\n\n---\n\n18 A Form SD is an Exchange Act Form used to satisfy special disclosure requirements implemented under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\nEnvironmental Investment and Compliance\n\nOur right to operate relies on compliance with relevant laws and regulations. This includes those related to environmental impacts. We work diligently to ensure we operate in accordance with requirements.\n\nALIGNING WITH REGULATIONS\n\nRegulations under federal and state environmental laws impose strict limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. We believe our operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations covering areas of environmental protection. All relevant employees receive training in our standards and changing regulatory requirements while a comprehensive audit program monitors compliance and helps identify potential risks to our business and employees.\n\nEstablished external standards are a useful tool in guiding our efforts and we pursue certification where relevant. We consider Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification when building new facilities, and have certified 19 projects under the LEED standards, including one platinum, six gold and six silver certifications. We also consider external certification \u2014 like International Organization for Standardization (ISO) \u2014 where it adds business value. By the end of 2021, 52% of manufacturing sites under Abbott\u2019s operational control have been certified under ISO 14001 \u2013 Environmental Management and/or ISO 50001 \u2013 Energy Management standards. These sites represent 68% of our manufacturing site square footage.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES\n\nAbbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal, state and various other countries\u2019 environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations.\n\nAbbott\u2019s capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2021 were not material and are not expected to be material in 2022. We compile data on capital and operating expenditures related to environmental matters from all sites where this spending is over $1 million. In 2021, these sites reported operating expenditures for pollution control of approximately $40 million and capital expenditures for the same purpose of approximately $10 million.\n\nAbbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the U.S., including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other sites, some of which are owned by Abbott, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar agencies.\n\nWhile it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities, Abbott believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott\u2019s financial position, cash flows or results of operations.\n\n2021 Environmental Certifications\n\n| Certification | Total Sites Certified |\n|---------------|-----------------------|\n| Total ISO 50001: 2018 AND/OR 14001:2015 | 66 |\n| Total ISO 14001: 2015 | 49 |\n| Total ISO 14001: 2015 Manufacturing Sites | 41 |\n| Total ISO 14001: 2015 Nonmanufacturing Sites | 8 |\n| Total ISO 50001: 2018 | 29 |\n| Total ISO 50001: 2018 Manufacturing Sites | 17 |\n| Total ISO 50001: 2018 Nonmanufacturing Sites | 12 |\nQUALITY MANAGEMENT\n\nOUR CUSTOMER PLEDGE\nAt Abbott, we all put the people we serve at the center of everything we do. We make our products and services as if they are for our own families. We live Abbott\u2019s purpose of creating a healthier world where everyone can have better, fuller lives. We know that every one of us plays a vital role in bringing our life-changing solutions around the globe to people who need them.\n\nABBOTT PEOPLE PLEDGE TO:\n\nLISTEN TO\nlearn from and deeply understand those we serve better than anyone else, ensuring we always meet their needs\n\nALWAYS ANTICIPATE\nand adapt what we do \u2014 and how we do it \u2014 to continuously exceed our customers\u2019 expectations and stay relevant to their lives\n\nHOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE\nto our values and the highest standards in everything we do \u2014 because that\u2019s what we would expect for our own families\nProduct Quality\n\nPeople depend on Abbott products to improve their lives; we must build and retain their trust, so delivering high-quality, safe products is always our number one priority.\n\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH\n\nAbbott manufactures products at 90 sites globally, crossing many jurisdictions and involving oversight from over 100 quality and regulatory agencies. Product quality and safety are paramount for Abbott; we embed considerations from the highest levels of governance and throughout our entire business. Global oversight sits with our Senior Vice President, Quality Assurance, Regulatory and Engineering Services, who reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chairman of the Board. In each Abbott business, quality and regulatory leaders are responsible for the quality systems specific to their business and update each Abbott business president on progress. The Board\u2019s Public Policy Committee regularly reviews quality metrics, inspection findings, industry progress and emerging issues.\n\nSenior quality, regulatory and operations leaders meet at least quarterly to maintain quality systems with quality performance indicators, global industry standards and key market regulations. Our systems are agile to respond to and maintain compliance with changing regulations, such as:\n\n- EU Medical Devices Regulation (effective May 26, 2021)\n- EU In Vitro Diagnostics Regulation (effective May 26, 2022)\n- Swiss Medical Devices Ordinance (MedDO) (effective May 26, 2021)\n- China Order 739 (effective June 1, 2021)\n\nOur quality framework helps ensure compliance with regulatory requirements in every country where we operate.\n\nOUR 3R APPROACH TO ANIMAL RESEARCH\n\nAbbott is committed to minimizing use of animals in research and maintaining the highest humane care standards while meeting regulatory requirements. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulators require animal safety and efficacy data for many Abbott products, and we have an ethical obligation to explore potential health benefits and risks before they\u2019re used by patients.\n\nWe are developing testing to eliminate the need for animal models where feasible. When animal tests are required, we strive to reduce their number and frequency. We follow the 3Rs approach to adopting alternatives:\n\n- Replace the need for animal testing through non-animal research methods\n- Reduce the number of animals used to the minimum necessary for valid results\n- Refine experimental procedures to avoid or minimize pain and distress\n\nOur laboratory-animal research programs and facilities meet or exceed relevant regulations in countries where we operate.\n\nWhen human clinical studies commence, we conduct them in line with all relevant laws and regulations. Explore how we conduct clinical trials in our SASB Index.\nRobust Post-Market Surveillance\n\nOur Global Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) system helps ensure the highest quality and safety in marketed device and diagnostic products. It sets a global standard while supporting product-by-product monitoring. While we already maintain best-in-class, on-time medical device reporting (MDR), in 2021, our Quality and Regulatory team established a Human Error and Reliability Optimization project to target continual progress. The project introduces measures to address behaviors that can contribute to human error, including:\n\n- Examining current factors to assure on-time reporting\n- Categorizing these identified factors\n- Developing in-depth investigation tools based on these categories\n- Establishing a solution matrix to proactively address issues\n- Implementing a Case Reference Catalog to record learnings and support development of corrective and preventative actions\n\nThrough this process, we will strive to achieve 100% on-time MDR across Abbott, ensuring regulatory compliance.\n\nAdditionally, our Pharmaceuticals business uses a single pharmacovigilance (PV) system for marketed products to monitor worldwide safety reports and ensure disclosures to relevant authorities. This system is regularly reviewed by senior management while training is provided to support understanding among branded generic medicine division employees.\n\nQuality management decisions are made following product-specific safety surveillance based on predefined, risk-based criteria and applicable local legislation.\n\nQuality Management System\n\nAbbott has implemented a Quality System Manual, based on established regulations and industry standards, which governs the specific quality framework for each Abbott business and division. The system is implemented at a global level and incorporated into each division and site. The Quality System elements encompass the entire product life cycle \u2014 from research and development, clinical studies and product design through risk management, material, production and process controls and right up to distribution and post-market surveillance.\n\nThe Quality Management System model and metrics are continuously reviewed to track performance at site, business and company levels. Key learnings and best practices, including those from external intelligence, are captured and applied elsewhere in our organization. Where performance changes are identified, we analyze root causes and take necessary corrective action. In targeted use cases, we apply machine learning to enhance predictions of potential risks.\n\nEach operating business maintains Quality Management Systems and performs audits in line with governing regulations. Audits from the corporate level are also conducted. The results of all quality surveillance activities, which are well documented, feed into continuous improvement initiatives.\n\nEngaging Suppliers on Quality\n\nOur suppliers play a key role in our product quality and safety. A comprehensive, risk-based program ensures those that impact our regulated products and/or Quality Management System conform to predefined quality requirements.\n\nWe require suppliers to have a documented Quality Management System that is commensurate with the products and services that they provide to Abbott. Continuous monitoring measures suppliers against minimum performance criteria. Suppliers are classified according to risk level of potential impacts; evaluation frequency is determined based on this, ranging between every two (high-risk) and four (low-risk) years. Read about how we categorize suppliers for sustainability risks on page 67.\n\nEvaluations provide evidence that suppliers can deliver to our requirements, maintain adequate Quality Management System elements and conform business and process capabilities to relevant regulations and Abbott standards. On-site audits and additional agreements for high-risk partners confirm operational capabilities and Quality Management System requirements.\n\nWe collaborate and partner with key suppliers to continuously improve product quality and safety.\n\nAssuring Commercial Quality\n\nCommercial quality assurance (QA) ensures supply chain processes maintain product quality and compliance. Suppliers are expected to maintain management systems, training and competency programs, facilitating continual improvement and ensuring compliance with our guidelines. We require that suppliers provide evidence of any employee training performed.\n\nThe One Abbott QA initiative establishes common management procedures for:\n\n- Organization and professional development\n- Operational excellence\n- Customer satisfaction\n- Supply chain assurance\n\nThrough our One Abbott approach, we have aligned our systems for managing suppliers, documentation, warehouse controls, distribution controls, nonconformance and corrective and preventive action (CAPA).\nDeveloping Employees\n\nNew employees are trained on Quality Management System elements, while existing employees are systemically retrained. Topics include data analytics, cleanroom qualification, risk management and documentation controls. Annually, a Quality Management System Refresher course is updated and deployed to all existing and part-time personnel. In 2021, new trainings were available on:\n\n- Human Reliability and Human Reliability Tools for Corrective and Preventive Action\n- Product Risk Management\n- Laboratory Testing and Controls\n\nAdditionally, all employees with product quality responsibilities benefit from:\n\n- Good Manufacturing Training offerings at the business level\n- Corporate-level quality courses, many in multiple languages, on topics including:\n  - Complaint Handling\n  - Clinical Practices\n  - Data Integrity\n  - Document and Change Control\n  - Product Design and Development\n\nEach business offers division- and site-specific trainings, tailored through a review of our current offering, inspection outcomes, training requirements and emerging industry issues. In 2021, 42 employees were newly qualified through the American Society for Quality (ASQ) and Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society (RAPS) for certifications including Quality Engineer, Quality Auditor, Manager of Quality/Organizational Excellence, Six Sigma Black Belt and Regulatory Affairs. This brings the total number of certified employees to 1,000 across the business to date.\n\nIndependent Quality Certification\n\nWe embrace independent quality certification as an opportunity to drive continuous improvement and operational excellence across Global Commercial Manufacturing, R&D and Commercial operations. Manufacturing operations hold Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification such as International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certification for quality management. Nutrition manufacturing maintains food and safety standards certification as well.\n\n19 This list represents a sample of the certifications our sites maintain and that are frequently used as indicators of product quality.\nAbbott is committed to upholding the highest standards for manufacturing of all nutrition products and has been implementing corrective actions and enhancements at the facility to give parents and customers renewed confidence in the quality of manufacturing at this plant. Our efforts have included increasing our finished product testing; confirming process consistency; enhancing our environmental monitoring program; installing non-porous, easily cleanable sanitary floors; and implementing revised traffic control patterns to further protect the manufacturing environment.\n\nWe know that our decision to recall product worsened the industry-wide formula shortage in the U.S., and prior to restarting production we worked to get as much product as we could into the hands of parents by increasing supply at our other FDA registered facilities, including bringing in Similac from our site in Cootehill, Ireland, by air and producing more Similac and Alimentum. We also began releasing metabolic formulas that were previously on hold, to those who need these unique formulas.\n\nThrough support from Abbott, Patient Advocate Foundation established a $5 million Pediatric Amino Acid Formula Emergency Assistance Fund to help families of patients on amino acid-based formulas who\u2019ve been hospitalized or encountered emergency room visits as a result of the formula shortage. The fund will provide grants to help these families with medical and related living expenses.\n\nIn addition, we\u2019ve offered an increased number and value of coupons available for all our infant formula products, including Similac ready-to-feed, to enable customers to purchase formulas, either free or deeply discounted. And we are working with the USDA and state Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) agencies and paying rebates on competitive products in states where Abbott holds the WIC contract, when Similac is not available. Abbott will continue to pay rebates for competitive products through August 31. This means program participants will continue to be able to obtain formula, free of charge whether it is Similac or formula from another manufacturer.\n\nFinally, we are making significant investments to help ensure this never happens again. We plan to expand both capacity and redundancy. And we will similarly invest in upgrading our safety and quality processes and equipment.\n\nPre-Market Product Submission Review\nThroughout 2021, we established a team of technical and regulatory experts whose job it is to collaborate with the diagnostic business on driving better product approval outcomes. This includes targeting:\n\n- Consistency and technical robustness of submissions; complete, well written and consistent with regulations, guidance, expectations and current industry technical standards\n- Broad knowledge-sharing and training across divisions to drive awareness and adoption of FDA feedback and internal findings\n- Improvements to the design and development processes\n\n### Quality Inspections and Audits\n\n| Quality/Regulatory Inspections by Global Health Authorities | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| % resulting in zero observations                           | 81%  | 80%  |\n| FDA Site Inspections                                       | 4    | 12   |\n| % resulting in zero observations                           | 75%  | 92%  |\n| Average Number of Observations per Inspection              | 0.25 | 0.42 |\n| Internal Independent Corporate-Level Audits to Ensure Compliance with Abbott Quality Standards | 96   | 145  |\n\n### US FDA Class I and Class II\n\n| Business          | Class I | Class II |\n|-------------------|---------|----------|\n| Med Device        | 1       | 3        |\n| Diagnostics       | 1       | 6        |\n| Pharmaceutical(2) | N/A     | N/A      |\n| Nutrition         | 0       | 0        |\n\n### Total US FDA Warning Letters Issued\n\n| Business          | 2020 | 2021 |\n|-------------------|------|------|\n| Med Device        | 0    | 0    |\n| Diagnostics       | 0    | 0    |\n| Pharmaceutical(2) | 0    | 0    |\n| Nutrition         | 0    | 0    |\n\n---\n\n(2) Abbott does not distribute pharmaceutical products in the U.S.\n(2) As of 2021, Abbott has no open warning letters.\nProtecting Our Brand Through Third-Party Management\n\nThird-party manufacturers (TPMs) are some of our most critical suppliers. They create our finished products, often under the Abbott brand. To guarantee product quality and safety are always prioritized, we engage TPMs in aligning with our standards.\n\nOur TPM management process helps ensure effective quality management systems, procedures, certifications and controls. Several tools help safeguard our brand, including:\n\n- Global TPMs list\n- Corporate dashboard\n- Maturity assessments\n- Risk evaluation tools\n- Quality expectations\n- Quality agreement templates\n- Audits and evaluations\n- Corrective and preventive action feedback\n\nMatt Jones is a manufacturing process engineering lead tasked with developing and commissioning new fully automated production lines for FreeStyle Libre.\nCREATE A RESILIENT, DIVERSE AND RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nAbbott\u2019s global supply chain has proven its strength, resilience and ability to amplify our positive impact on the world. When we nurture a supplier network that\u2019s strong and ethical, we multiply our ability to touch people\u2019s lives and reduce shared sustainability impacts. And, by focusing on spend with diverse companies, we\u2019re creating a supplier base as varied as those we serve.\n\nINITIATIVE SPOTLIGHT\n\nIn 2021, we established a partnership with the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), a nonprofit committed to connecting private resources with under-invested people and places. Starting in 2022, we will provide financial assistance to select diverse suppliers. For more information, see page 71.\n\n$37.5M joint investment to support tailored solutions, talent development and growth resources\n\n$25M in financial assistance provided by Abbott\n\n$12.5M loan capital matching from LISC\nOur Approach to Supply Chain Management\n\nA healthy supply chain is one that is resilient, diverse and responsible. To build the sourcing network we envision, we are evolving our approach to how materials and services are procured, packaged and transported.\n\nOur Supply Chain Is Multi-Faceted\n\nOur intricate global network enables the company to get its life-changing technologies into the hands of the millions of people around the world.\n\nApproximately 76,000 suppliers\n\nAcross 154 countries\n\nIn 2021, we spent approximately $20.3 billion with these suppliers\n\nMore information on how we are working with suppliers to improve our environmental impacts can be found from page 40.\n\nOur 2030 Goals Progress\n\nEstablished language to incorporate our social responsibility requirements into direct material spend contracts\n\n31% AND 15% GROWTH in spend with Black- and women-owned businesses* respectively (2021 vs. 2020)\n\n48.6% SPEND increase with small businesses**\n\n100% OF SUPPLIERS assessed for sustainability risk\n\n3 PACKAGING INITIATIVES funded that will impact 8 million pounds of packaging materials\n\nIdentified a representative sample of suppliers with potential high-risk sustainability factors to pilot 2030 audit programming\n\nFor specific information on our 2030 goals around Supply Chain Management, see page 11.\n\n* Includes data from U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico suppliers.\n** Includes data from U.S. only.\nSupply Chain Governance\n\nWe are constantly evolving how we manage supplier relationships to minimize our shared sustainability impacts.\n\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH\n\nWith a global footprint, we have an opportunity to leverage our supply chain for positive social and environmental change. We maintain a robust, multi-layered governance structure that provides oversight of all supply chain-related activities, helping minimize risks and maximize opportunities to address shared impacts.\n\nOur management approach places particular importance on supply chain sustainability and resilience. Each business is responsible for their respective supply chain, with enterprise efforts coordinated through Abbott\u2019s Global Operations Council (GOC). The GOC collaborates across the enterprise to set the framework for our supply chain, encompassing manufacturing, procurement and logistics.\n\nThe evolution and execution of our global supply chain strategy is overseen by the Supply Chain Council (SCC), which meets quarterly and reports regularly to the GOC. Among other responsibilities, several additional groups assist the SCC in our efforts to improve supply chain adaptability, resilience and flexibility.\n\nA Targeted Strategy\n\nOur supply chain and procurement strategy embeds sustainability considerations into supplier selection and management processes. It is managed by our Corporate Procurement team, a group that spans geographies, organizations and business functions.\n\nOur strategy is designed to ensure the products we make \u2014 and what others make for us \u2014 are sourced and produced ethically while mitigating negative sustainability impacts. It centers around five objectives:\n\n- Ensure our supply network aligns with, protects and elevates our brand\n- Create relationships that deliver shared value by conducting business with transparency and trust\n- Enhance margins and elevate financial performance by optimizing total cost, balancing risk with return and certainty\n- Expedite growth and drive innovation through proprietary and exclusive opportunities\n- Design a flexible, dynamic supply network, driving service with value and quality while mitigating supply risk\n\nGLOBAL OPERATIONS COUNCIL\n\nOversees operations strategy across manufacturing, supply chain, engineering and EHS\n\nSupply Chain Council\n- Composed of senior leaders with responsibility for the supply chain of each Abbott business\n- Makes recommendations for achieving a sustainable, resilient supply chain\n- Leads development of a consistent global approach to identifying and managing sustainability opportunities and risks\n\nSupplier Diversity Governance Council\n- Responsible for growing a strong, diverse supplier base\n- Appoints Supplier Diversity Champions in each business and major spending category\n\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Leadership Council\n- Responsible for governing EHS-related topics\n- Composed of EHS leaders from all business divisions\n- Provides expertise to advise supply chain assessments and engagements\n\nPackaging Community of Practice\n- Responsible for leading packaging development efforts at corporate and divisional levels\n- Drives implementation of Abbott\u2019s 2030 sustainable packaging goal\n\nExecutive Crisis Management Team\n- Responsible for managing supply chain risks for business continuity\n- Supported by Global Security organization and 32 country-specific crisis action teams\nGuiding Responsible Suppliers\n\nWe are committed to upholding the fundamental principles of human rights, labor, environmental protection and anti-corruption to ensure long-term business success for Abbott and our suppliers, and to improve lives around the world. Our Supplier Guidelines establish our expectations of any supplier we enter a business relationship with. The Guidelines align with the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact and the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) Principles for Responsible Supply Chain Management.\n\nThrough the Guidelines, we detail minimum conditions to help ensure that our suppliers conduct their business in an ethical manner, with integrity and in compliance with all relevant legal requirements and industry codes. In 2020, we updated our Guidelines to strengthen our focus in five key areas.\n\nSuppliers must be able to demonstrate compliance with our Guidelines at the request and to the satisfaction of Abbott through our Supplier Social Responsibility program. It is Abbott\u2019s expectation that our suppliers fully support the Guidelines and drive sustainability principles across their own supply chains, systems and employee benefits. This helps ensure materials and services from Tier 2 suppliers, and deeper, also meet our requirements.\n\nWe embed a social responsibility clause in our direct material procurement contracts. The clause details Abbott\u2019s values and sets the expectation that vendors will comply with the focus areas of our Supplier Guidelines. It enables assessment of this compliance and requires our vendors to remediate any issues identified.\n\nAbbott\u2019s Procurement professionals are required to complete training on the Guidelines and contract language to ensure these expectations are understood internally and cascaded to our suppliers. Likewise, our suppliers are responsible for training their employees to meet the expectations detailed in the Guidelines.\n\nIn combination with our Supplier Guidelines, several additional policies and guidelines further our supply chain sustainability strategies:\n\n- **Green Procurement Guidelines**: support our Sourcing team to identify environmentally preferable goods and services and request them from suppliers\n- **Global Environmental, Health and Safety Policy**: guides engagement with strategic stakeholders, suppliers and contractors to help ensure compliance with regulations and applicable Abbott standards to reduce EHS impacts\n- **Supplier Diversity Guidelines**: commit Abbott to equal opportunities for small businesses and those owned or operated by members of underrepresented groups\n- **Water Policy**: sets supplier requirements for transparency on water management practices\n- **Climate Responsible Energy Guidelines**: encourage suppliers to reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency\n- **Animal Welfare Policy**: guides our work with animal-related suppliers and contract laboratories, including expectations that animal use in any testing or process should occur only after alternatives have been fully explored and rejected\n- **Position Statement on Conflict Minerals**: details a process for understanding conflict mineral sourcing and use, including identification of in-scope products and suppliers, supplier engagement and requirements to disclose the presence and source of conflict minerals in their supply chains\n\nRead more about how we ensure Abbott\u2019s standards are upheld throughout the supply chain on page 82.\nEvolving Social Responsibility Language\n\nIn 2021, we updated the language in our social responsibility clause that will be included in direct material contracts. Implementing this clause contributes to our goal of having 80% of newly contracted direct material spend incorporate social responsibility requirements. In support of this initiative, teams with contracting authority or oversight in our Divisional, Procurement and Legal functions were trained on the new language and how to engage with suppliers to implement it.\n\nProduct Traceability and Critical Materials\n\nAbbott maintains product traceability throughout manufacturing and distribution by leveraging tracking and tracing technologies and enterprise resource planning solutions. This way, we can help ensure compliance with regulatory, quality and control requirements. Critical material use is managed through our product stewardship program (see page 54).\n\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\n\nGrowing Our Team\n\nIn 2021, we expanded the Supply Chain Sustainability team within our Global Procurement organization, and continued partnering with Operations, Supply Chain and EHS functions to manage our supply chain sustainability strategy, governance and programming. We also established a network of Sustainability Liaisons to act as representatives for each business division in support of our 2030 goals and supply chain initiatives.\nSupplier Risk Assessment and Engagement\n\nWe want to work with suppliers that share our commitment to sustainability. We maintain a formal process for assessing suppliers to minimize reputational and continuity risks, and to help ensure compliance with our Supplier Guidelines.\n\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH\n\nChoosing the Right Suppliers\n\nWhen selecting suppliers, we consider applicable environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors alongside business capabilities and capacities, financial health and alignment with our vision. Using classification models, we measure the risk levels and shared sustainability impacts of the applicable relationship.\n\nAll suppliers on our Approved Suppliers List are categorized as high (critical), medium or low risk. Critical suppliers are those identified as:\n\n- Supplying materials, components or services that influence the safety or performance of our products\n- Our only approved source of materials, components or services\n- Integral to our business continuity\n\nSuppliers are also evaluated based on supply chain transparency and complexity, alignment with certification schemes, how close they are to our customers and whether they\u2019ve demonstrated commitment to product security.\n\nOur process for confirming suppliers meet our quality standards is detailed on page 58.\n\nDirect and Indirect Suppliers\n\n- Annual high-level ESG risk assessments of supply base\n- 150\u2013300 potential high sustainability risk suppliers surveyed to understand management systems, programs and performance\n- Auditing of highest sustainability risk suppliers completed every 1\u20135 years depending on industry and prior performance\n- Post-audit actions determined by program and stakeholders (see individual program descriptions for details)\n\nStrategic Sourcing Category Initiatives\n\n- Targeted initiatives to assess and engage suppliers operating in sourcing categories with significant sustainability risks and/or opportunities\n\nIndustry Organizations\n\n- Industry standard and practice alignment\n- Knowledge sharing and best practices\n- Supplier training opportunities to address shared risks\n- Shared supplier assessments to minimize reporting burden on suppliers\n\nNongovernmental Organizations (NGOs) and Charitable Organizations\n\n- Collaboration on initiatives\nRisk-Based Monitoring and Evaluation\n\nWe have global policies and procedures for evaluating suppliers for potential sustainability issues, including those related to ethics, human rights and labor, health and safety, environment and management systems. Our supplier assessment programs take a risk-based approach to determine assessment, monitoring and audit requirements. They consider supplier size, maturity, industry, sourcing regions, ESG performance and Abbott spend. This is particularly relevant to our critical suppliers, but we also assess non-critical suppliers that operate in high sustainability risk industries or regions with potential risk exposure.\n\nAbbott utilizes a third-party risk monitoring tool to perform real-time analysis of critical supplier sourcing locations, tracking potential geopolitical, security, sustainability, environmental and infrastructure risks. Sustainability risk scores consider performance in employee autonomy, workers\u2019 rights, child labor and environmental factors. We also use the tool to monitor supply chain disruptions and to identify suppliers and locations that pose potential business continuity risk. These insights then inform our sourcing strategy and contingency plans.\n\nAdditional risk-specific analyses are performed for strategic sourcing categories and regions when potential risks are identified.\n\nSupplier Survey and Audit Program\n\nAbbott\u2019s Supplier Sustainability Survey and Audit Program is an ongoing effort that enables global supply chain assessment and engagement on a broad range of sustainability topics. Through a two-year cycle, we identify and engage potential high sustainability risk suppliers, as well as those with the greatest opportunities to address shared sustainability impacts, to evaluate their sustainability risks and ensure business continuity.\n\nFirst, our global supply base is assessed, considering overall sustainability impacts, as well as topic-specific impacts such as human rights and labor, EHS risk, waste diversion opportunities, climate impacts and carbon management. Then 150\u2013300 potentially high sustainability risk suppliers are identified by our Procurement and Business teams for participation in Abbott\u2019s annual Supplier Sustainability Survey. The survey helps us understand supplier sustainability maturity and opportunities to improve supply chain sustainability and resilience, covering:\n\n- Management systems\n- Compliance and reporting\n- Ethics\n- Human rights and labor practices\n- Health and safety\n- Environmental performance\n- Supply chain management\n\nSuppliers are determined to be \u201chigh sustainability risk\u201d when responses are not aligned with the expectations outlined in our Supplier Guidelines.\n\nAfter reviewing the survey results, suppliers selected for audit are notified and audited by an external third-party auditor using Workplace Conditions Assessment (WCA) \u2014 or other globally recognized \u2014 standards. These standards assess a supplier\u2019s social and labor conditions, health and safety, environment and business practices at the facility level. Depending on supplier industry and survey/audit results, audit frequency can range from one to three years.\n\nPositive Results on Engagement\n\nTo assess how companies engage suppliers on climate issues, the CDP provides a Supplier Engagement Rating (SER). In 2021, we were proud to receive an SER of A-, placing us in the Leadership band.\nWhere major issues are noted, suppliers must submit corrective and preventive action (CAPA) plans within 30\u201360 days of receiving audit results. Abbott\u2019s supplier relationship manager and subject matter experts will then monitor the supplier\u2019s CAPA implementation and determine if a reaudit or other action, such as contract termination, is required. We also encourage suppliers to report concerns via our Speak Up tool, which is covered in more detail on page 79.\n\nIn addition to our Supplier Sustainability Survey and Audit program, we maintain category- and region-specific supplier assessment and audit programs where specific sustainability risks have been identified. They include our Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) Program, Waste Vendor Assessment Program, Animal Welfare Program and Conflict Minerals Program. These programs are detailed on pages 70\u201373.\n\nInsights collected through these supplier assessment and engagement programs support better supplier engagement and inform development of sustainability initiatives for implementation at the supplier, sourcing and/or business level.\n\n**OUR 2021 PERFORMANCE**\n\n**Engaging the Right Global Suppliers**\n\nIn 2021, 210 suppliers covering 25% of spend were engaged through Abbott\u2019s Supplier Sustainability Survey. We also updated the survey to better understand risks and opportunities in line with current and emerging sustainability-related issues and our 2030 goals.\n\nIn addition to survey respondents, 51 high sustainability risk suppliers were audited with overall findings indicating Abbott is limited to minimal sustainability risk based on the suppliers assessed.22\n\n**Safeguarding Business Continuity and Supply Chain Risk Mitigation**\n\nRisk profiling, global event monitoring and an alert system support identification of potential supply disruptions and inform proactive responses. In 2021, our risk profiling exercise more than doubled the number of supply chain areas monitored.\n\nTo further safeguard our business and supply chain against unforeseen events, we created a Supply Chain Resilience program to develop people, processes and tools to evaluate and engage with suppliers on identified topics. 2021 actions included an end-to-end risk assessment for products identified as critical or constituting the top 80% of revenue for each business, and establishment of standard metrics for measuring internal and external risks. In total, over 50 products were profiled; this included more than 2,500 unique supply chain points, such as suppliers, plants and distribution centers.\n\nThroughout 2021, COVID-19 remained a challenge to supply chain resilience. In response, we maintained precautions put in place the previous year, including building an inventory of raw materials and finished goods to help ensure supply continuity. We continued to monitor performance at manufacturing sites in known COVID-19 hotspots to inform contingency plans. Where labor shortages caused by the pandemic threatened to impact key raw materials suppliers, we provided BinaxNOW COVID-19 tests to enable increased employee testing.\n\n---\n\n22 Includes unique count of suppliers audited in 2021 through Abbott\u2019s Global Social Responsibility, Waste Vendor Assessment, and Chemicals of Environmental Concern and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Supplier Assessment programs.\nStrategic Supply Chain Initiatives\n\nWith a global business and supply chain as complex as ours, the opportunity to partner with suppliers on addressing social and environmental impacts is significant. We collaborate across businesses and functions to partner with various supply chain stakeholders on reducing shared sustainability impacts \u2014 like worker health and safety, climate change, natural disasters, resource scarcity, cybersecurity and disease outbreaks.\n\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH\n\nPartnering Across the Supply Chain\n\nBy connecting with external stakeholders and global leaders in sustainability, we can nurture a responsible supply chain management approach that continuously improves the sustainability of our supply chain. Organizations we partner with include:\n\n- **Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI):** promotes collaboration to improve sustainability programming and provide suppliers with capability training through online and in-person learning opportunities\n- **National Association for EHS&S Management (NAEM):** encourages advanced environmental stewardship, safe and healthy workplaces, and global sustainability\n\nWe also engage suppliers on sustainability risks and opportunities affiliated with products and services they supply to Abbott. Outcomes of these partnerships include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Supplier education and mentoring to improve sustainability awareness and management performance\n- Connecting to explore business continuity solutions and opportunities to source, design, produce and distribute products in ways that respect environment, society and human health impacts\n- Solutions to reduce shared sustainability impacts across Abbott and our suppliers\u2019 value chains\n\nStrategic Supply Chain Initiatives\n\nOur supply chain initiatives aim to reduce shared impacts, particularly in priority areas such as labor, human rights, environment and anti-corruption. The SCC has developed two types of initiatives:\n\n- **Issue-specific initiatives:** cover the whole supply chain and address targeted topics, such as supplier diversity and management of emissions, water and inbound materials\n- **Sourcing category-specific initiatives:** cover multiple sustainability risks and opportunities in high sustainability risk sourcing categories\n\nSourcing Categories With High Sustainability Impact\n\n- Agriculture\n- Dairy\n- Energy\n- Packaging\n- Chemicals of Environmental Concern and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients\n- Transportation and Distribution\n- Waste Management\nIn 2021, more than 5,600 suppliers were engaged on sustainability risks and opportunities, influencing over 47% of our supply chain spend.\n\nA Recognized Commitment to Supplier Diversity\n\nSupply chain diversity is a cornerstone of our sustainability plan. It encourages innovation, opens new procurement channels and supports community prosperity through economic growth and inclusion. With our Supplier Diversity Program, we are creating opportunities for diverse and historically underrepresented suppliers. And under our Tier 2 program, we partner with key suppliers to increase spend with their diverse suppliers.\n\nWe have remained steadfast in our commitment, prioritizing increased spending with small, women-, minority- and veteran-owned businesses. This includes incorporating diversity goals into all procurement sourcing categories and appointing 14 Supplier Diversity Champions across Abbott\u2019s four business segments. Through these efforts, we leverage diverse supplier relationships to support their development and growth.\n\nWith Abbott contributing $25 million and LISC a further $12.5 million, funding will help businesses in three ways:\n\n- Growth capital grants\n- Business loans\n- Technical assistance\n\nEligible businesses include those owned by people of color, women, veterans, people with disabilities, people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) and other historically underrepresented groups. And, to help ensure the initiative supports a more equitable healthcare industry, funding will go to businesses focused on manufacturing or business-to-business products for diagnostics, nutrition products, medical devices and other key health technologies.\n\nOur memberships in the following organizations open other doors to working with diverse groups:\n\n- National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC)\n- Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC)\n- National LGBT Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC)\n- Diversity Alliance for Science\n- Diverse Manufacturing Supply Chain Alliance (DMSCA)\n- Chicago United\n\nRead more about how we\u2019re promoting supply chain diversity on page 19 of our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Report.\n\nPromoting Diverse Healthcare Supply Chains\n\nWhile a driving force for change, 50% of diverse small business owners in the U.S. face challenges like restricted access to loans for business growth. To address this gap, we partnered with the LISC on a $37.5 million initiative to provide diverse small businesses with the financial support they need to succeed.\nAddressing Supply Chain Water Risks\nBy 2030, we aim to work with 50 key suppliers in high water-stressed areas to reduce risks to water quality and quantity. In 2021, we conducted a water risk assessment to identify key suppliers. Using the World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct\u2122 Global Water Tool, this assessment considered supplier industries, sourcing locations and level of water stress. Of those identified, 26 suppliers representing 4% of total 2021 spend were engaged through our Supplier Sustainability Survey to better understand existing water risk mitigation efforts and opportunities.\n\nAgriculture and Addressing Deforestation\nAbbott is a leader in sustainability, with an internal surveillance program that tests above industry requirements. Our Food and Safety Council (including representatives from Supply Chain, Regulatory, and Research and Development) meets on a quarterly basis to address concerns related to our agriculture supply chain, including sustainability issues. In part, this involves due diligence of our sourcing practices and those of our agricultural suppliers to better understand environmental, social and deforestation risks, particularly for soy- and palm-derived products.\n\nWe do not use palm oil in our products. However, we use sustainably sourced soy- and palm-derived ingredients (such as palm nuts and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) oil), which can be affiliated with deforestation. In 2021, 0.3% of total spend was with these ingredients, and 0.1% was from deforestation affiliated regions.\n\nAnimal Welfare in Dairy\nWe are committed to improving conditions for animals producing dairy ingredients for our products, by supporting the World Organisation for Animal Health\u2019s Five Domains of Animal Welfare. In 2021, 95% of the milk we procured (by spend) was certified to animal welfare standards.\n\nChemicals of Environmental Concern and Antimicrobial Resistance\nAbbott\u2019s branded generic medicines business assesses suppliers operating in at-risk regions that handle and/or manufacture chemicals of environmental concern and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs). Abbott is a small player in the global anti-infectives market, but recognizes our role in limiting antimicrobial resistance.\n\nThis assessment evaluates suppliers based on supply chain criticality and environmental, health and safety risk. Suppliers are evaluated via a questionnaire depending on the level of risk assigned.\n\nAn on-site visit may be triggered if a supplier is determined high-risk from questionnaire review, if it\u2019s had a significant incident, received notice of violation or negative media reporting, or is identified by one of our internal stakeholders. Upon completion of the on-site assessment, suppliers are assigned a risk status and follow-up actions are determined, including CAPA execution by the supplier, continuation of business activities, identification of back-up suppliers and/or implementation of an exit strategy. By assessing suppliers this way, we aim to minimize environmental risks and ensure business continuity.\n\nIn 2021, 48 self-assessments were completed by suppliers. On-site visits of 39 suppliers \u2014 16 of which were desk-based as a result of COVID \u2014 were completed by Abbott or third-party subject matter experts. Of the on-site assessments completed, six were shared with industry partners through the PSCI data-sharing platform.\n\nEmissions Management in Our Supply Chain\nScope 3 emissions account for about 93% of Abbott\u2019s carbon footprint. As such, a cross-functional team \u2014 including corporate and divisional EHS, Procurement and Supply Chain functions \u2014 has partnered to identify our most carbon-intensive suppliers and sourcing categories with the greatest opportunities for emission reductions.\n\nIn 2021, we completed a maturity assessment to understand key suppliers\u2019 existing carbon management efforts and their impact on our Scope 3 emissions. A representative supplier sample of 115 suppliers, covering 23% of supplier spend, was then engaged through Abbott\u2019s Supplier Sustainability Survey to identify opportunities for carbon reductions.\n\nRead more about emissions on page 43.\n\nRenewable Energy Procurement\nWe are always on the lookout for renewable energy sourcing options, increasingly purchasing electricity from utility providers that include above average renewable generation in their energy mix. We estimate that 80,000 metric tons of CO2e were avoided through the purchase of low-carbon and renewable energy in 2021.\n\nBusiness Travel\nAs a result of the ongoing pandemic, we continue to avoid nonessential business travel where possible. This has resulted in a 55% decrease in business travel-associated Scope 3 carbon emissions compared to pre-pandemic levels (2019) and a 9% increase from 2020 to 2021.\nTransportation and Distribution\nWe are reducing the impact of transportation and distribution activities, and balancing emission savings with the need for timely delivery of lifesaving products. Our U.S. businesses follow the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) SmartWay\u00ae program to advance supply chain sustainability through measuring, benchmarking and improving freight transportation efficiency.\n\nIn 2021, Abbott moved freight 45.9 million miles across North America using multiple modes of transport. This included 1.2 million miles and 605 shipments through intermodal transport, and 44.7 million miles and 71,999 truckloads sent by road.\n\nPackaging\nThoughtful packaging design is the surest way to employ circularity characteristics \u2014 like recyclability and material efficiency \u2014 are incorporated into our products. We are utilizing our newly created Sustainable Packaging Guiding Principles to tailor how we work with material and technology suppliers on innovative, sustainable solutions.\n\nPartnering With Inbound Materials Suppliers on Waste Diversion\nForming robust supplier partnerships is critical to achieving our operational waste diversion targets. Abbott\u2019s EHS, Procurement and Supply Chain teams are committed to developing and tracking waste diversion initiatives in collaboration with our key suppliers.\n\nIn 2021, we established a process and criteria for identifying suppliers with the greatest potential to influence the environmental impacts of Abbott\u2019s inbound materials that become waste from our operations. Our approach included engaging Abbott manufacturing sites with significant waste production to identify the suppliers contributing the greatest impacts to our waste footprint. We also broadened our scope to include our largest suppliers in strategic sourcing categories.\n\nThrough this process, we identified over 60 suppliers with potential inbound waste partnership opportunities; a representative sample of almost 40 was engaged through Abbott\u2019s Supplier Sustainability Survey to identify future opportunities to collaborate.\n\nPartnering With Suppliers for Reuse and Responsible Waste Management\nWe partner with waste management suppliers to ensure our waste is responsibly handled and disposed of, where feasible, divert it from landfill and incineration without energy recovery. This includes seeking opportunities to reuse and recycle materials and targeting beneficial-use activities, where waste is sent to off-site partners for use as a substitute to commercial products and commodities.\n\nOur technical standard for evaluating and approving vendors mandates ethical, responsible approaches to waste management and aims to minimize risks associated with what we dispose of. For manufacturing sites that produce more than 1,200 kilograms of hazardous waste annually, our Waste Vendor Assessment program requires on-site audits of waste management firms at least every five years. This program has assessed 717 waste vendors within the last five years and 139 in 2021. In addition, we completed 24 hazardous waste vendor on-site audits and 13 desktop audits under the 2020 COVID-19 protocol in 2021.\n\nWe maintain an IT standard specifically for evaluating and approving vendors for electronic waste, ensuring responsible recycling and, where viable, resale of IT waste. In 2021, we partnered with two primary waste vendors to recycle 212 U.S. tons and resell an additional 67 U.S. tons of electronic equipment.\n\nCutting the Distance Between Abbott and Our Suppliers\nFor many years, our facility in the Netherlands has relied on a Germany-based bottle supplier. However, when a packaging supplier built a new state-of-the-art manufacturing factory close to our own manufacturing facility in 2020, we took the initiative to source packaging more locally.\n\nNot only has this switch reduced manufacturing lead times; it has drastically cut shipping distances by 217 miles for each shipment \u2014 annual savings of 528,000 miles. This, in turn, translates into emission savings of roughly 754 metric tons of CO2e and brings us another step closer to achieving our emission goals.\n\nTransportation Modes (% of Global Spend)\n\n| Mode                  | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|-----------------------|------|------|------|\n| Air                   | 20%  | 22%  | 26%  |\n| Over the Road         | 33%  | 31%  | 25%  |\n| Parcel                | 28%  | 22%  | 29%  |\n| Multi-modal and Rail  | 9%   | 12%  | 6%   |\n| Ocean                 | 10%  | 13%  | 14%  |\n\nTotal Global Spend in Scope 100% 100% 100%\nGOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY FOUNDATIONS\n\nOur 2030 Sustainability Plan sets a clear course for how we innovate for access and affordability, embed sustainability in everything we do and transform lives. Robust governance helps ensure we have the leadership, policies and structures in place to succeed.\n\nINITIATIVE SPOTLIGHT\n\nTo create a business that improves people\u2019s lives, we must engage everyone at Abbott. From seeking guidance from a diverse Board of Directors to developing training that reinforces our shared responsibility for ethical business practices, our approach puts sustainability front and center.\n\n>104,000 employees trained through our Legal and Ethical Resource Network program\n\n7 YEARS is the average tenure of Abbott Board Members\nCorporate Governance and Board Oversight\n\nAbbott is committed to strong corporate governance that aligns with stakeholder interests. Our Board of Directors spends significant time with senior management to understand global dynamics, challenges and opportunities. Directors provide insight and ask questions that guide management decision-making.\n\nOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nAbbott\u2019s Board of Directors consists of our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Robert B. Ford, a Lead Independent Director and 10 other independent directors.\n\nThe Lead Independent Director \u2014 currently Chair of the Nominations and Governance Committee, William A. Osborn \u2014 is selected by and from the independent directors and has significant responsibilities. These include:\n\n- Acting as a liaison between the Chairman and independent directors\n- Communicating with the Chairman on agenda topics and Board-related matters\n- Reviewing and approving meeting topics and schedules\n- Conferring with the Nominations and Governance Committee and CEO on management succession planning\n- Leading annual performance reviews of the Board and its committees\n- Overseeing director candidate identification and evaluation process\n- Working with management on corporate governance developments\n- Authority to call meetings of the independent directors\n- Engaging directly with major shareholders\n\nEach year, Abbott\u2019s directors evaluate the effectiveness of the Board and its committees in performing its governance and risk oversight responsibilities. Directors assess the performance of their peers, as well as the full Board of Directors and each of the committees on which they serve, as follows:\n\n1. Written evaluations solicit feedback on performance of:\n   - Individual directors, including:\n     - Independent thinking and action\n     - Discussion and decision contributions\n     - Ethical standards and values\n     - Professional competence in oversight and governance\n   - The full Board and committees, including:\n     - Structure and composition\n     - Effectiveness of oversight and other responsibilities\n     - Encouragement of open communication and differing viewpoints\n\n2. Results Collection and Review\n   - To ensure candid feedback, directors submit evaluation responses to an independent third party that anonymizes and compiles them into reports.\n   - The Nomination and Governance Committee reviews peer and Board reports. Each committee reviews its respective report.\n   - All responses are shared with the full Board.\n\n3. Feedback Incorporation\n   - Feedback requiring additional consideration is addressed at Board and committee meetings. Enhancement opportunities are identified and implemented as appropriate.\n   - The Chair of the Nominations and Governance Committee discusses peer evaluation results with individual directors as needed.\nBoard Composition and Diversity\nAbbott\u2019s Board of Directors is composed of people who bring diversity of experience, expertise, ethnicity, gender and geography to the table. When identifying nominees to serve as candidates, our Nominations and Governance Committee considers these areas and assesses the effectiveness of our selection process.\n\nBOARD COMMITTEES\nThe Board has four key, fully independent committees:\n\n1.

The Board of Directors has determined that Nancy McKinstry is an \u201caudit committee financial expert.\u201d\nA DEFINED APPROACH TO RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT\n\nOur Office of Ethics and Compliance (OEC) oversees regular compliance risk assessments. It follows changes in the external risk environment, including evolving industry codes and best practices, government guidance and enforcement actions taken against other companies. Our Anti-Corruption Compliance Enhancement (ACE) program evaluates specific commercial practices to identify potential compliance risks. Corruption risks are also included in enterprise-wide risk assessments conducted at least annually by our corporate audit group.\n\nEnterprise risk management (ERM) focuses on risks that have the potential to impact business performance. It continuously evaluates likelihood, impact and velocity to ensure our management team focuses efforts in the most relevant areas. Our ERM Network team \u2014 14 functional experts led by Abbott\u2019s Vice President, Internal Audit \u2014 brings consistency and structure to risk evaluation and integrates ERM throughout our business. The Vice President, Internal Audit presents annual updates to the Audit Committee and completes detailed reviews of specific enterprise risks. The Board and its committees review enterprise risks throughout the year.\n\nMitigating Acquisition Risks\n\nAcquiring businesses and products is key to evolving our offering. We maintain a clear process for assessing risk when integrating new acquisitions and ensuring they align with our quality, safety and environmental requirements. A cross-functional team identifies and prioritizes risks to develop integration action plans, focusing on ensuring compliance with country requirements and our own internal standards. Employees from the acquired company receive training to enable a smooth transition.\n\nRead more about how we ensure acquisitions comply with our environmental standards on page 42.\n\nEmerging Risks and Opportunities\n\nAs well as addressing existing risks, we analyze emerging situations that represent potential risks and opportunities for Abbott.\n\nEmerging Risks and Opportunities Response\n\nDisruptive technologies\n\nTechnology is increasingly important in healthcare. As requirements for connected solutions grow, we face increasing industry competition and from technology companies branching out into healthcare. The impact of the pandemic has accelerated the need for products that converge technology and healthcare at an unprecedented speed. This presents a challenge where we face competitors not only in our own industry but technology players who are currently making strides into the healthcare sector. We view these challenges as an accelerator to our innovation and as an opportunity to develop products that can address health needs through meaningful innovation that is guided by patient needs. We see this as an opportunity to advance Abbott solutions, partnering across industries on increasingly effective solutions.\n\nThe changing landscape poses new opportunities at the intersection of healthcare and technology. The convergence of healthcare and technology has shifted the spectrum of care from hospitals and healthcare institutions to digital solutions and remote therapy, from reacting to disease management to preventative care and wellness, and from general diagnosis to customization of care. To remain competitive, our technologies must be science-driven, consumer-friendly, accessible, affordable and relevant. Abbott is creating solutions that enable self-diagnosis, offering devices and digital platforms that connect patients and doctors and enable quicker, better-informed decisions. Our 2030 Sustainability Plan focuses on designing access and affordability into our life-changing technologies and products. This plan requires us to design our technologies and products for broader access and affordability at every step \u2014 from every phase of our R&D process, to the materials we use, to manufacturing, to the ways we reach the people who need them.\n\nFrom pandemic to endemic \u2014 the new normal\n\nAs COVID-19 continues to create significant impacts and uncertainties for the global economy, we have executed proactive and reactive risk mitigation strategies specifically focused on COVID-19 and novel viruses to keep history from repeating itself. Increased likelihood of pandemics represents an opportunity to advance research capabilities. Through the formation of the Abbott Pandemic Defense Coalition \u2014 the first of its kind \u2014 we are able to detect threats sooner and respond quicker. In addition, we have developed a suite of COVID-19 testing platforms that supports multiple different diagnostic solutions for the different stages of infection and recovery.\n\nWhile we continue to remain alert on the pandemic front, we must also have the foresight to prepare to move from pandemic to endemic. Our efforts in meeting the world\u2019s COVID-19 testing demands have not detracted our investments and ability to deliver strong growths in our Medical Devices, Nutrition, Established Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics businesses. As highlighted in our annual reports and press releases for the past two years, we have delivered a continued stream of new products and initiatives around the world, signifying progress and balanced strength in all four business segments.\nEthics and Integrity\n\nActing ethically and with integrity is of the utmost importance to Abbott. It\u2019s how we care for people and the planet and how we show the world we are a company that can be trusted.\n\nGOVERNING ETHICAL PROCESSES\n\nAbbott\u2019s Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer (CECO) is the Corporate Officer responsible for leading our global ethics and compliance program and managing our OEC. The CECO provides regular briefings to our CEO, executive leaders, to Abbott\u2019s Board of Directors and the Public Policy Committee.\n\nThe CECO chairs Abbott\u2019s Business Conduct Committee (BCC), which includes our CEO and is composed of executive-level leaders. The BCC meets regularly to discuss legal and regulatory changes, monitor best practices and the ongoing operation of our compliance program, and discuss planned actions designed to continuously improve the program.\n\nA SHARED COMMITMENT TO INTEGRITY\n\nWe want to build a culture of integrity and compliance, engaging every employee in upholding ethical behaviors. Our global online Legal and Ethical Resource Network (LERN) training program is run in 91 countries and 32 languages. It informs employees of all aspects of our Code of Business Conduct, with practical guidance on recognizing and responding to legal and ethical issues.\n\nFull- and part-time employees are assigned LERN courses based on their role and responsibilities. In 2021, over 104,000 employees completed lessons. The LERN curriculum also includes certifications on the code and conflicts of interest, with a key focus on interactions with healthcare professionals. All Abbott employees are expected to review and sign these annually.\n\nIn 2021, we launched Ethics and Compliance Week to drive awareness and engage with employees on compliance-related topics through global and region-specific initiatives. Ethics and Compliance Week kicked off with a company-wide email titled \u201cAre You on the Right Path When it Comes to Ethics and Compliance?\u201d that was viewed by over 55,000 employees. This was followed by a message from Abbott\u2019s CECO and select executive vice presidents on the importance of integrity and upholding Abbott values, which was available in 24 languages and viewed by over 57,000 employees. Highlighting Ethics and Compliance Week activities in the U.S., additional compliance messages were viewed by over 23,000 employees, inviting them to nominate Compliance Heroes who live our commitment to integrity every day. The OEC received 420 nominations, and ultimately recognized 27 employees as Compliance Heroes. In Latin America, Ethics and Compliance Week activities included an Olympics of Ethics and Compliance challenge that attracted more than 4,000 participants. Other regions engaged in similar activities, ranging from communications to interactive sessions designed to reinforce compliance policies and programs.\n\nOn December 9, recognized as International Anti-Corruption Day, Abbott\u2019s CECO sent a company-wide email available in 25 languages, raising awareness of corruption and highlighting Abbott\u2019s commitment to combat and prevent bribery and corruption. The communication included links to Abbott\u2019s Anti-Corruption Overview as well as other tools such as LERN training modules, our Third Party Compliance program and our Speak Up reporting tool.\n\nInteracting With Healthcare Professionals\n\nCertain countries require additional transparency and restrict how businesses can interact with healthcare professionals. We comply fully, providing additional certification and reporting payments and transfers of value. Interactions are monitored and audited periodically.\n\nOur commitment to ethical interactions with healthcare professionals, patients and consumers includes communicating responsibly \u2014 and in compliance with regulations \u2014 about our products and services.\nCompliance\n\nTo be trusted as a responsible business, we ensure that ethical practices are constantly upheld and that we are working in compliance with relevant regulations.\n\nSEVEN STEPS TO COMPLIANCE\n\nThe voluntary Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers outlines seven fundamental elements for effective compliance programs; we have created our own global ethics and compliance program with reference to these points. The program is regularly reviewed by an external party.\n\nDetails of our compliance leadership, training and communication can be found on page 78. Our risk assessment process is outlined on page 77.\n\nWRITTEN STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nOur Code of Business Conduct is available in 29 languages and lays the groundwork for ethical conduct at Abbott. It outlines our company values and the expectation for our employees to live them every day. Every employee is required to read and certify adherence to the code annually.\n\nOur code and other policies align with guidelines issued by medical technology trade associations such as AdvaMed, APACMed, MedTech Europe and Mecomed. Additionally, our policies and procedures align with regulatory licenses and approvals we obtain to promote, sell and import medical devices, diagnostics, nutrition products and medicines.\n\nOur Nutrition business is committed to developing science-based products for all ages and to marketing these products ethically and in compliance with all local laws and regulations. We maintain robust systems for ensuring conduct at every business level aligns with our Global Infant Formula Marketing Policy and laws in the countries where we operate.\n\nEthics and compliance policies are updated regularly to reflect regulatory and industry changes.\n\nProcesses for Reporting Concerns\n\nOur code emphasizes employees\u2019 responsibility to report concerns of noncompliance, including those related to workplace discrimination or harassment. To promote this, we strive to create an environment where they feel safe to do so without fear of retaliation. We have defined avenues and processes for asking questions and reporting suspected or actual violations of our code, policies or procedures. This includes our Speak Up tool, through which employees and external parties, including suppliers, can confidentially and \u2014 where permitted \u2014 anonymously raise concerns of potential misconduct. Speak Up can be accessed by telephone, email or internet 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Live Speak Up telephone support includes operators who speak multiple languages for non-English speakers. Employees may also contact the OEC, Legal or the CECO directly.\n\nEach report is entered into a database by the Ethics and Compliance Officer or delegated vendor or personnel. These are then investigated by the appropriate function so the OEC can determine if any action is needed. Periodic audits of this process help ensure we are conducting investigations as quickly and thoroughly as possible.\n\nOur Employee Problem Solving policy provides a system for openly exchanging information and resolving concerns. It applies to all Abbott employees worldwide, except where local laws or collective bargaining agreements dictate otherwise.\nRigorous Auditing and Monitoring\n\nOur international audit and monitoring process assesses compliance with our code, policies and procedures. Assessments determine the frequency and scope of audits. We maintain a tracking system for all action items identified to ensure business leaders are held accountable for making any necessary improvements to processes in a timely manner.\n\nThe OEC monitors business activities throughout the year. OEC personnel supporting each Abbott business unit and country perform an annual risk assessment to identify areas of potential compliance risk. Based on assessment outcomes, they then establish monitoring plans for the year.\n\nOur monitoring includes selecting a risk-based sampling of interactions with healthcare providers (HCPs) (such as educational events, engagements with HCPs for services, and provision of sample or evaluation product) and reviewing supporting documentation to assess compliance with Abbott\u2019s policies.\n\nThe OEC also conducts \u201clive monitoring\u201d programs through which personnel directly observe HCP interactions. Issues detected through monitoring are analyzed, investigated if necessary and reported to management. Monitoring data are analyzed and trended over time to identify potential patterns requiring further evaluation. The OEC assigns and tracks to completion remedial actions, addressing the root causes of monitoring findings.\n\nProcesses for Investigations and Corrective Actions\n\nAll reports of potential code violations \u2014 including those related to discrimination and harassment \u2014 by employees and third parties that perform certain services on our behalf are thoroughly investigated. Where necessary, corrective actions are taken. Any employee who violates our code, policies or procedures is subject to appropriate disciplinary action, which may include termination. Employees refusing to cooperate in an investigation \u2014 or anyone who knowingly reports a false concern, or one intended to threaten, intimidate or retaliate \u2014 may also be subject to disciplinary action.\n\nAbbott does not tolerate retaliation against those who report concerns. In addition, Abbott encourages employees to report any instances of retaliation, separately investigates those reports and disciplines employees who have engaged in retaliation. Corrective action related to Code violations, including retaliation, may involve disciplinary action up to and including termination.\nCorruption and Anti-Bribery\n\nAs a global healthcare company, we work and interact with thousands of people every day. We maintain strict protocols to safeguard our business against activities that could be viewed as corruption or bribery.\n\nPROTECTING OUR RIGHT TO OPERATE\n\nEssential to protecting our reputation and right to operate is ensuring we never provide or accept anything of value to gain an improper advantage or inappropriately influence business decisions. Our Global Anti-Corruption Policy, available in 29 languages, prohibits bribery and corruption in any form. Employees complete annual training on this and other related policies and procedures.\n\nAs a publicly traded company, we are subject to audits by external auditors. The results of these are reported periodically to the Board\u2019s Audit Committee. Abbott is committed to adherence to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act and all other applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. We expect that every third-party company we do business with or that performs work on our behalf will act in accordance with these same laws.\n\nPREVENTING ANTI-COMPETITIVE PRACTICES\n\nWe commit to complying with competition laws in every country where we do business. These laws prohibit agreements and practices that eliminate or discourage competition. They apply to various facets of our business, including competitor relationships, prices and terms of sale, and marketing and trade practices.\n\nWe maintain a compliance program to ensure our operations comply with all relevant competition laws. We have established an in-house Competition Law Practice Group, composed of members of our Legal team and the OEC. The group meets regularly to identify risks and the best course of action to address them. It also monitors legal developments that may impact our global operations and assists in providing ongoing competition law training to employees.\n\nEmployees are encouraged to contact our Legal team or the OEC directly for legal guidance regarding interactions with competitors and to report any inappropriate conversations. Reports can also be made through our Ethics and Compliance helpline.\n\nInternal Controls to Prevent Bribery and Corruption\n\n- Risk assessments to identify and monitor potential risks or areas for more robust processes.\n- Policies and procedures with guidelines and approval requirements for business interactions and activities.\n- Independent Internal Audit team that reports directly to the Audit Committee and verifies policy and procedure compliance.\n- A platform for employees and external parties to raise concerns of potential misconduct.\n- OEC approval of all procedures regarding items that could be characterized as gifts, including brand reminders, cultural courtesies and items of medical utility.\n- Investigations of all reports of potential violations.\nTHIRD-PARTY COMPLIANCE\n\nAll third parties that Abbott works with are expected to hold themselves to the same standards of ethical and legal compliance as we do ourselves. Third-Party Guidelines detail the requirements we expect partners to meet. They are available through our website in 18 languages. We provide training on these guidelines and anti-corruption issues to third parties, with a training deck developed for our OEC to guide country-specific training, particularly with companies that promote our products to healthcare providers on our behalf.\n\nA new e-learning platform, which we are in the process of launching, will provide and track online training for each third party that undergoes due diligence.\n\nA Third-Party Compliance Process identifies and addresses corruption and bribery risks that arise when interacting with government officials or healthcare providers on our behalf outside of the U.S. It requires Abbott businesses, subsidiaries and affiliates outside the U.S. to complete due diligence before engaging third-party companies. This includes screening companies, identifying high-risk partners, and monitoring and mitigating any potential risks.\n\nPotential partners are required to answer detailed questionnaires, while an external vendor engaged by Abbott performs due diligence background checks.\n\nThe check covers risks including:\n- Corruption\n- Fraud\n- Organized crime\n- Regulatory breaches\n- Human rights and labor abuses\n- Social accountability\n- Arms trafficking and war crimes\n- Violations of government-imposed sanctions\n- Terrorism\n- Money laundering\n- Anti-competitive behavior\n\nWhere risks are identified, appropriate remedial action is developed and implemented by the OEC and our Legal team, including additional contract terms, auditing, monitoring, training or termination/rejection of the third party. We routinely update our Third-Party Compliance Process to mitigate risks and better protect our business against bribery and corruption.\nProtecting Our People, Products and Brands\n\nEnsuring the authenticity of our products is critical for maintaining trust in Abbott and our products. We maintain strict protocols for eliminating counterfeit products and protecting against security risks.\n\nPROTECTING PRODUCT AUTHENTICITY\n\nWe are continuously innovating to mitigate counterfeiting and illegal diversion risks. This is driven by our Global Security, Legal, Trademark, Regulatory, Public Affairs and Business Unit (BU) teams.\n\nOur enforcement program removes thousands of fraudulent online marketplace listings for counterfeit and diverted products every month. The Global Security team uses state-of-the-art analytics to identify and eliminate unauthorized sales. In 2021, we removed 16,692 marketplaces, apps, websites and social media sites selling counterfeit, diverted, outdated and stolen products, and 218,128 individual product listings.\n\nThroughout 2021, we continued to harness a virtual Security Quality Review (vSQR) process we developed in 2020, completing around 70 reviews of cross-business risks. Our Global Security team launched training for all core businesses, addressing topics related to Interconnected Security Services (ISS) while a new Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM) program is enhancing security measures for key sites.\n\nPROTECTING OUR EMPLOYEES\n\nGlobal Communications Center (GCC) analysts monitor world events, providing advance warning of emerging threats and ensuring employees are safe and accounted for. Situational Awareness For Everyone Everywhere (SAFEE) training bolsters security awareness. In 2021, our Global Security team provided training, including SAFEE, to 17,000 employees.\n\nRegional security experts and our Travel Safety program protect employees traveling for work. In 2021, the program supported 28,000 travelers.\n\nSECURING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nWe are committed to eliminating criminal activities, including drug trafficking, terrorism, human trafficking, forced child labor, cyber threats and illegal contraband from our supply chain. We comply with all international customs laws, and carefully choose our partners to prevent unethical practices and security threats.\n\nOur efforts exceed U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) enhanced Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) Minimum Security Criteria (MSC). We partner with CBP and an external vendor on a surveillance system that mitigates theft, counterfeiting and illegal diversion risks. Additionally, we remain a Tier 3 CTPAT partner, enabling movement of products in and out of the U.S. with expedited processing and 80% fewer customs exams. Many Abbott businesses also participate in the Authorized Economic Operator program.\n\nA Strategic Approach to Product and Brand Protection\n\nOur enforcement program is built on industry best practices and ensures we address the most significant risks. Enforcement tactics include:\n\n- Covert market surveys\n- Removing counterfeit products and sites\n- Halting sale of unauthorized products\n- Providing contract security language and enforcing policies with authorized resellers\n- Identifying and removing illicit actors via paid searches\n- Reporting fake social media accounts\n- Eliminating illegitimate and cybersquatted sites that could harm the Abbott brand\nSecuring Our BinaxNOW Supply Chain\n\nEnsuring customers always receive legitimate Abbott goods requires that we track our products at every step of the value chain.\n\nThroughout 2021, we performed robust supply chain risk management processes for our BinaxNOW tests. This included securing over 8,000 shipments to successfully deliver almost 1 billion tests. To prevent fraudulent sales, we removed 70,000 listings selling illicit tests on e-commerce sites. We also partnered with eBay to ensure all test kits were automatically detected and taken down.\n\nThese steps helped guarantee that the products customers received were legitimate, safe and effective, and prevented $4.6 million in losses for Abbott.\nPublic Policy Engagement\n\nPublic policy can be a great enabler of societal health. Abbott\u2019s diverse businesses help us have a substantial positive impact, but they also increase the complexity of our interactions with policymakers, trade associations and thought leaders as we work to encourage policies that support access to our innovations.\n\nENGAGING ON POLICY SOLUTIONS\n\nWe connect with various organizations to identify solutions to complex healthcare issues. Three internal principles ensure engagement on policy developments complies with our own standards as well as relevant laws:\n\n\u2022 We commit to ethical behavior and transparency, guided by our Code of Business Conduct in all our activities, including public policy engagement. Public policy activities comply with all applicable laws and regulations and adhere to Abbott policies. Abbott, relevant Abbott employees, and external lobbyists and firms register as lobbyists and file lobbying and contribution disclosures as required by applicable law.\n\n\u2022 We pursue activities to shape policies that impact our company and benefit the people who need our products, with a focus on improving access to new medical advances and helping people live fuller, healthier lives. The Board of Directors\u2019 Public Policy Committee has lead oversight of our Government Affairs function and public policy issues that could impact our business, performance and public image. This includes reviewing and evaluating our governmental affairs and political participation, including advocacy priorities, political contributions, lobbying activities and trade association memberships.\n\nPARTICIPATION IN POLITICAL ACTIVITY\n\nWe contribute to U.S. state and local candidates and political organizations through our Abbott Employee Political Action Committee (AEPAC). We support those that we believe understand the impact of government actions on medical access, and those that will promote environments that foster continued medical progress.\n\nAbbott\u2019s Government Affairs function reviews and approves all U.S. political contributions and advocacy activities. It covers direct advocacy at the federal, state and local levels as well as managing Abbott\u2019s relationships with trade associations and similar groups. Further oversight of advocacy at the state level is provided by our State Government Affairs function while activities with the U.S. Congress and the federal government fall under our Federal Government Affairs office.\n\nIn the U.S., in compliance with the Lobbying Disclosure Act, Abbott files a quarterly report that includes the following:\n\n\u2022 Total federal lobbying expenditures\n\u2022 The name of the specific legislation or subject that was the topic of communication\n\u2022 Disclosure of Abbott individuals who lobbied on our behalf\n\u2022 Identification of the legislative body or executive branch that was contacted\n\nIn 2021, Abbott reported $4,210,000 in U.S. federal lobbying.\n\nRead more about public policy engagement on the Corporate Political Participation page of our website.\n\nU.S. TRADE ORGANIZATIONS\n\nWe are a member of various U.S. trade organizations that engage in lobbying and other political activity to champion our needs, those of our industry and those of the people who rely on Abbott solutions. Our participation in these trade associations, and other tax-exempt organizations that write and endorse model legislation, is assessed annually by the Government Affairs function.\nWe began reporting on our sustainability efforts in the early 1970s, with our first reports focusing on community engagement and environmental impacts. As our business has grown so too has our approach to reporting.\n\nWe align our annual reporting with the requirements of ESG ratings and sustainability indices, as well as providing an analysis of our performance. We refer to external standards, such as the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP). In this appendix you will find the following Abbott sustainability indices:\n\n- GRI from page 115\n- SASB from page 124\n- TCFD from page 130\n- Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) from page 132\n\nAdditional sustainability reports and performance updates, including country reports for key markets, can be found on the Sustainability Reporting page of our website.\n\nSCOPE OF THIS REPORT\n\n- All financial information is stated in U.S. dollars.\n- All data reflect Abbott\u2019s activities, with a focus on 2021 results.\n- Neither this report nor our website contains performance information on joint ventures, unless otherwise noted.\n- Select information and data calculations from prior years have been adjusted to reflect our separation from AbbVie in January 2013.\n- All Abbott trademarks appear in italics throughout this report.\n\nREPORTING FEEDBACK\n\nDevelopment of our sustainability strategy was informed by the expertise of several external sources. These experts also guide stakeholder engagements, the development of our Responsibility website and the production of this report. We gratefully acknowledge the counsel we receive from Corporate Citizenship, Flag and WBCSD, among others. Working with these groups better informs our reporting approach, keeps us abreast of external expectations and helps us identify areas of opportunity for strengthening stakeholder engagement.\n\nWe welcome feedback on our report. Please send us an email at responsibility@abbott.com to share yours.\n\nEXTERNAL ASSURANCE\n\nWe engaged Apex Companies, an independent assurance provider, to conduct assurance of selected 2021 environmental and safety data. Our website includes a PDF of the Apex Assurance Statement.\n\nABBOTT\u2019S POLICIES\n\nOur policies help Abbott meet or exceed national and international standards in all countries where we operate. The following critical policies are published on our website:\n\n- Code of Business Conduct\n- Supplier Guidelines\n- Position Statement on Conflict Minerals\n- Environmental Policy\n- Energy Policy\n- Water Policy\n- Environmental Procurement Guidelines\n- Global Environmental, Health and Safety Policy\n- Anti-Corruption Training Guide for Companies Doing Business With Abbott\n- Clinical Trial Registrations and Results Disclosures\n- Financial Reports for Healthcare-Related Organizations\n- Stakeholder Engagement Policy\n- Position Statement on Tax\n- Our Commitment to Cybersecurity\n- Position Statement on Human Rights\n- Global Infant Formula Marketing Policy\n- Global Animal Welfare Policies\nWhen developing our 2030 Sustainability Plan, we conducted an in-depth materiality analysis of the environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues that are most important for our business.\n\nA FIVE-STEP APPROACH\n\nWorking with external consultants Corporate Citizenship, we developed and applied a comprehensive process for identifying and ranking our material issues.\n\n1. Conduct extensive research on potential issues: included benchmarking efforts against peers and competitors; tracking emerging issues; working with customers and rating and rankings organizations; and identifying best practices. This rigorous process involved detailed analysis of over 200 sustainability topics.\n\n2. Stakeholder interviews: conducted interviews with over 100 internal and external stakeholders, including customers, suppliers, investors, healthcare providers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), sustainability experts and employees.\n\n3. Issue ranking: using feedback from the interview process, our Executive Leadership team prioritized topics according to importance to stakeholders and importance to the future success of our business. Considerations included the relationship of each issue to our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process. The information supported development of our materiality matrix and ESG topics that will drive our strategy over the next 5\u201310 years.\n\n4. Working groups: created working groups to address each priority issue. Our Finance and Corporate Audit teams were engaged to help ensure Abbott\u2019s targets are integrated into our business strategy and financial plan.\n\n5. Sustainability Plan summit: to define our 2030 Sustainability Plan goals, targets and key performance indicators (KPIs), we held a day-long summit with more than 100 cross-company leaders. Leaders offered cross-business and cross-function representation to ensure alignment across the global business. Outcomes of the summit guide our progress, drive improvement and ensure Abbott\u2019s future competitiveness.\nStakeholder Engagement\n\nWe understand listening to stakeholders is vital to our success. That\u2019s why Abbott is an active participant in global dialogs on the role of business in ensuring better health. It helps us to stay adaptable, creating local solutions that meet people\u2019s changing needs and tackle the world\u2019s most important health challenges. And it informed our 10-year strategy to build a stronger, more sustainable Abbott that better serves those who depend on us.\n\nWe conduct stakeholder engagement formally through the associations and partnerships we are a member of. Informally, we also connect with stakeholders through a range of networks and organizations we participate in.\n\nOur local country businesses are key to preserving strong stakeholder relationships. Teams regularly review stakeholder engagement strategies, ensuring they align with our wider stakeholder engagement methodology. The outcomes of local engagements are reported in country-level citizenship reports, or at local forums. This way, we can keep informed of major areas of stakeholder concern in the regions where we operate.\n\nCUSTOMER SATISFACTION\n\nOur Net Promoter Score\u00ae (NPS) is an externally recognized metric for customer satisfaction. Internally, we see it as a key indicator of our ability to continuously meet customers\u2019 needs. As an example of our performance, the NPS for our diagnostics business increased from 32.1 in 2010 to 58 in 2021.\n\nGLOBAL STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT\n\nInvestors\n- Investor calls\n- In-person meetings\n- Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meetings, quarterly earnings calls and conferences (full investor calendar webpage)\n- Investor newsletter\n- Annual Report\n- Global Sustainability Report\n- Investor section of Abbott.com\n- Social media (Twitter\u00ae, Facebook\u00ae, Instagram\u00ae, YouTube\u00ae and LinkedIn\u00ae)\n- Email alerts\n\nCustomers\n- Customer meetings\n- Customer call centers\n- Sales ambassadors and customer relationship managers\n- Field service representatives\n- Business and country representatives (Global Locations & Contacts webpage)\n- For Consumer and Healthcare Professionals sections of Abbott.com\n- Brand websites\n- Social media (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and LinkedIn)\n- Focus groups\n- Clinical trials\n\nSuppliers\n- Strategic partnerships\n- Procurement specialists\n- Supplier Guidelines published in multiple languages\n- Supplier Diversity Policy and Program\n- Supplier Social Responsibility Program, including surveys\n- Supplier audit programs\n- Supplier scorecards\n- Active leadership in the Diverse Manufacturing Supply Chain Alliance (DMSCA)\n- Suppliers section of Abbott.com\n\nFor more details, see the Supply Chain section (page 62).\n\nEmployees\n- Employee surveys\n- Annual All-Employee Meeting with our Chairman and CEO\n- All-employee emails from our Chairman and CEO\n- Business and functional town hall meetings\n- Employee networks\n- Abbott World intranet\n- Abbott World Today daily email articles\n- aLIVE smartphone app\n- Yammer\u00ae groups\n- Employee Giving Campaign\n- Internal employee volunteering website\n\nFor more details, see our Workforce section (page 29).\n\nGovernments\n- Government affairs liaison\n- Trade associations/organizations\n- Abbott Employee Political Action Committee\n- Global Citizenship and Abbott Fund programs\n- Corporate Political Participation webpage\n\nFor more details, see the Governance section (page 74).\n## Key Financial Metrics\n\n### Sales Worldwide\n\n| Year | Dollars in Millions |\n|------|---------------------|\n| 2021 | $43,075             |\n| 2020 | $34,608             |\n| 2019 | $31,904             |\n| 2018 | $30,578             |\n\n### R&D Investment\n\n| Year | Dollars in Millions |\n|------|---------------------|\n| 2021 | $2,700              |\n| 2020 | $2,420              |\n| 2019 | $2,440              |\n| 2018 | $2,300              |\n\n### Dividends Paid\n\n| Year | Dollars in Millions |\n|------|---------------------|\n| 2021 | $3,202              |\n| 2020 | $2,560              |\n| 2019 | $2,270              |\n| 2018 | $1,974              |\n\n### Social Investing<sup>a</sup>\n\n| Year | Dollars in Millions |\n|------|---------------------|\n| 2021 | $90.1               |\n| 2020 | $75.7               |\n| 2019 | $70.6               |\n| 2018 | $62.7               |\n\n### U.S. Employee Giving Campaign Results\n\n| Year | Dollars in Millions |\n|------|---------------------|\n| 2021<sup>b</sup> | $15.00              |\n| 2020 | $7.58               |\n| 2019 | $6.71               |\n| 2018 | $6.58               |\n\n---\n\n<sup>a</sup> Totals and percentage changes may differ from listed metrics due to rounding.

Refer to page 114 for endnotes.\nMetrics Endnotes\n\nAll environmental data has been adjusted to account for acquisitions and divestitures, in accordance with the methodology prescribed in the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP). We report data from acquisitions as soon as is practical. To that end, this data includes the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical, Glomed and Alere Inc. Furthermore, this data reflects the divestiture of Abbott Medical Optics.\n\n(a) Abbott Fund\n(b) 2021 marked the first year of our enhanced employee giving program. See page 35.\n(c) These percentages are as of December 31, 2020. Percentages represent a count of U.S. employees, excluding the rapid diagnostics business.\n(d) This includes Alere employees.\n(e) Legacy Alere is included in Health and Safety and Scope 3 metrics beginning in 2019. 2018 metrics do not include legacy Alere.\n(f) Annual incident rates are calculated per 100 employees, assuming the average employee works 40 hours per week and 50 weeks per year. This is equivalent to 200,000 hours worked.\n(g) This change represents 2021 progress toward our 2030 Goal of 30% reduction from 2018.\n(h) This is the percentage change from 2020 to 2021.\n(i) This is the baseline year.\n(j) Progress toward 2030 carbon goal is reported using the GHGP Scope 2 market-based methodology.\n(k) Scope 2 emissions are calculated using the GHGP market-based methodology. Per the GHGP, where market-based information is not available, location-based results have been used as proxy.\n(l) Reported Purchased Fuels Scope 1 sources consist of fuel consumed by manufacturing, R&D and warehouse facilities under Abbott\u2019s control; sales fleet; and Abbott-owned aviation.\n(m) Per the GHGP, Scope 1 Refrigerant CO2e emissions include only those covered in the Kyoto Protocol.\n(n) Reported Scope 2 sources consist of energy directly purchased by Abbott, such as electricity, steam, and hot and chilled water, as well as emissions from leased locations. Unless specified otherwise, emissions are calculated according to the GHGP Scope 2 location-based method.\n\n(o) Abbott\u2019s nonenergy-consumption greenhouse gas emissions, such as refrigerant releases and process air emissions, are omitted. The total CO2 equivalents from nonenergy sources are noted in the Total Emissions (Scope 1 and 2) table.\n(p) All Scope 3 calculations are adjusted to account for updated spend metrics. Sourcing category spend allocations are subject to change year over year in alignment with business strategy. Legacy Alere included in metrics beginning in 2019. 2018 metrics do not include legacy Alere.\n(q) This reflects emissions from fuel combusted by manufacturing, R&D and warehouse facilities under Abbott\u2019s control.\n(r) Water-stressed locations have been determined using the WRI Aqueduct\u2122 global water risk mapping tool. Sites rated as having high or extremely high baseline water stress in the tool are classified as being water stressed.\n(s) Water withdrawal is equivalent to water intake.\n(t) Abbott\u2019s diversion rate is calculated as follows: (Total Waste + Beneficial Use - Landfilled and Incineration without Energy Recovery)/Total Waste + Beneficial Use. Commercial and other building activities, specific to beneficial use, are included in this rate starting in 2019.\n(u) In 2018, data represents manufacturing, R&D and warehouse facilities under Abbott\u2019s control. Nonmanufacturing data was not collected prior to 2019.\n(v) Waste-generation data does not include materials that are reused beneficially.\n(w) Abbott defines beneficial-use activities as sending material that otherwise would have been wasted off site to be used as an effective substitute for a commercial product or commodity. Beneficial-use material is used as is or in substantially the same form as it was generated.\n(x) The definition of \u201cgovernment agency inspection\u201d was updated in 2017 by Abbott to include routine visits and sample collection from regulatory agencies or designated representatives.\nWe sought to prepare this report in reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards.

The following index provides content aligning with disclosures related to the Medical Equipment & Supplies Standard; Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals Standard; and Processed Foods Standard. Unless otherwise noted, all data disclosed is as of December 31, 2021.\n\n### Affordability and Pricing\n\n**HC-MS-240a.1:** Ratio of weighted average rate of net price increases (for all products) to the annual increase in the U.S. Consumer Price Index.\n\n| Year | Total Abbott Net Sales Price Change (year-on-year %) | Global Consumer Price Index (year-on-year %) |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| 2021 | -1.5                                                | +3.9                                        |\n| 2020 | -0.4                                                | +1.7                                        |\n| 2019 | +0.2                                                | +2.4                                        |\n| 2018 | -1.0                                                | +2.6                                        |\n\nAffordability and access are priorities for Abbott as we strive to help people live fully through our life-changing products and technologies. We aim to reach as many people as possible who need these healthcare solutions. As part of our 2030 Sustainability Plan, we have an intentional focus on designing sustainable access and affordability into our new life-changing technologies so that we can make them widely available at affordable prices to people who need them. Pricing, however, is only one of the factors that determine affordability. Abbott also is advocating for systems and approaches that broaden access while minimizing additional costs for consumers and payers.\n\nIn 2021, Abbott\u2019s product pricing reflected the company\u2019s approach, with an annual global net sales price change of -1.5%, which compares to a Global Consumer Price Index (CPI) of +3.9% for 2021. This metric is modified from the metric provided by SASB by substituting a global CPI for the U.S. CPI. Sales outside of the U.S. in 2021 comprised approximately 61% of Abbott\u2019s revenue. Abbott believes that disclosing product pricing relative to the Global CPI is an appropriate way for investors and other stakeholders to best understand pricing for products across our diversified, global businesses. The global CPI is the total headline CPI for each country weighted by Abbott\u2019s geographic revenue exposure. For more on Abbott pricing, see Abbott\u2019s 10-K filing for 2021.\n\n### Product Safety\n\n**HC-MS-250a.1:** Number of recalls issued, total units recalled.\n\n| Business | FDA Class I and Class II |\n|----------|--------------------------|\n| Med Device | Class I | Class II |\n| Diagnostics | 1 | 6 |\n| Pharmaceutical | N/A | N/A |\n| Nutrition | 0 | 0 |\n\nAbbott Laboratories sells diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. (For more details, see page 20 in our Innovate for Access and Affordability section in this report.) Given the breadth of our product offerings, each Abbott division sells products using a variety of contracting methodologies. Divisions use a variety of price concessions in their sales contracting, including point-of-sale discounts, rebates and wholesaler chargebacks. These price concessions can be for single or multi-product sales and may include products from multiple business units or divisions (such as all medical device business units or rapid and molecular diagnostics). Price concessions may be based upon factors such as volume, market share and purchase commitments, or result from competitive bidding processes, and are generally documented in executed contracts, purchase orders and term sheets. Point-of-sale discounts are reflected in invoices that show the discounted prices, and rebates are documented in written agreements, with rebate calculations provided at the time rebate payments are made.\n\nOur customers span the globe and include federal, state and local governments, hospitals, group purchasing organizations, wholesalers, individual healthcare providers and consumers. We maintain pricing flexibility to meet the needs of our diverse customers, large and small, and to ensure that our essential healthcare products are available and affordable across the globe.\nSUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (SASB) INDEX CONTINUED\n\n**Metric** | **2021 Disclosure**\n--- | ---\nHC-MS-250a.2: List of products listed in the FDA's MedWatch Safety Alerts for Human Medical Products database. | See the FDA's MedWatch safety alerts for human medical products database.\n\n- Potential for False Positive Results with Abbott Molecular Inc.

If a healthcare professional asks about uses for Abbott products that are beyond the scope of approved labeling (sometimes referred to as \u201coff-label\u201d uses), the inquiry should be directed to the designated function for such inquiries in each Abbott division, which normally resides in Medical Affairs.\n\n**Product Design and Life Cycle Management**\n\nHC-MS-410a.1: Discussion of process to assess and manage environmental and human health considerations associated with chemicals in products, and meet demand for sustainable products. | To identify and mitigate the environmental impacts of our packaging and products throughout their life cycles \u2014 and at every stage of the value chain \u2014 relevant teams must work together. Our Product Stewardship, Supply Chain, R&D, Engineering and EHS groups partner closely to analyze how and where we source. We continuously monitor the regulatory landscape and any change to hazardous chemical requirements. Our Corporate Product Stewardship organization holds regular forums for informing all areas of our company about the potential business impacts these changes could have. Our enhanced regulatory intelligence process ensures potential impacts are identified in a timely manner. It also follows actions taken at the business level to confirm we remain compliant.\n\nOur product stewardship program tracks and addresses hazardous chemical legislation and supports the implementation of due diligence on conflict minerals. We offer product stewardship training on hazardous chemical legislation and conflict minerals to all relevant teams, including R&D, Supply Chain, Procurement and EHS.\n\nHC-MS-410a.2: Total amount of products accepted for takeback and reused, recycled or donated, broken down by (1) devices and equipment and (2) supplies. | See page 73 of the Our 2021 Performance section in the Create a Resilient, Diverse and Responsible Supply Chain section of this report.\n\nWe look for opportunities to reduce waste going to landfills by collecting our diagnostic products for recycling, refurbishing and energy recovery. In one of our various takeback programs, we collected and refurbished over 350 instruments and diverted approximately 350,000 lbs. of product waste from landfill in 2021. Some of Abbott\u2019s takeback programs are driven by government regulations; however, others are proactive initiatives.\nSupply Chain Management\n\nHC-MS-430a.1: Percentage of (1) entity\u2019s facilities and (2) Tier 1 suppliers participating in third-party audit programs for manufacturing and product quality.\n\n| Quality Inspections and Audits | 2020 | 2021 |\n|--------------------------------|------|------|\n| Quality/regulatory inspections by global health authorities | 490  | 559  |\n| % resulting in zero observations | 81%  | 80%  |\n| FDA site inspections | 4    | 12   |\n| % resulting in zero observations | 75%  | 92%  |\n| Average number of observations per inspection | 0.25 | 0.42 |\n| Internal independent audits to ensure compliance with Abbott quality standards | 96   | 145  |\n\nApproximately 61% of Tier 1 suppliers participate in third-party auditing programs. Suppliers are classified according to risk level of potential impacts; evaluation frequency is determined based on this, ranging between every two (high-risk) and four (low-risk) years.\n\nHC-MS-430a.2: Description of efforts to maintain traceability within the distribution chain.\n\nAbbott ensures product traceability throughout manufacturing and distribution by leveraging identification technologies and enterprise resource planning solutions. Through these systems, we guarantee compliance with regulatory, quality and control requirements.\n\nHC-MS-430a.3: Description of the management of risks associated with the use of critical materials.\n\nAbbott maintains product traceability throughout manufacturing and distribution by leveraging identification technologies and enterprise resource planning solutions. Through these systems, we ensure compliance with regulatory, quality and control requirements. Critical materials used in our products are managed through our product stewardship program. We have developed a product stewardship program to minimize the impact of our products and their packaging throughout the product life cycle. The program tracks and addresses regulations regarding restricted chemicals and ensures due diligence regarding conflict minerals. We carefully monitor and document regulatory changes, and we inform all areas of our company about the potential business impacts of these changes through regular product stewardship business meetings.\n\nEach business conducts assessments of new and changed products for substances of concern or restricted and critical materials. Risk assessments are prepared whenever these substances are identified. We then evaluate:\n\n- Whether continued use can be justified\n- The value of use versus reformulation\n- Any potential compliance issues\n\nThe evaluation also serves as an opportunity to research suitable alternatives and how they could impact product performance and cost. Recommendations for next steps contain justification for substance use, product support strategies and a business risk monitoring plan. These are all reviewed by business management.\n\nBusiness Ethics\n\nHC-MS-510a.1: Total amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with bribery or corruption.\n\nWhen public disclosure criteria are met, the total amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with bribery or corruption is included in our 2021 Annual Report.\n\nHC-MS-510a.2: Description of code of ethics governing interactions with healthcare professionals.\n\nWe respect the expertise of healthcare professionals, who provide guidance about healthcare treatment options and healthy living. Healthcare professionals, such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses, researchers or laboratory staff, must use their independent judgment to decide the best course of care for their patients based on their training and expertise. We are committed to working with healthcare professionals to provide them with timely and accurate information to assist them in making decisions and providing advice to their patients. We can achieve our mission of supporting health only through a truly collaborative approach.\n\nWe want to build a culture of integrity and compliance, engaging every employee in upholding ethical behaviors. Our global online Legal and Ethical Resource Network (LERN) training program is run in 91 countries and 36 languages. It informs employees of all aspects of our Code of Business Conduct, with practical guidance on recognizing and responding to legal and ethical issues, with a key focus on interactions with healthcare professionals.\n\nActivity Metric\n\nHC-MS-000.A: Number of units sold by product category\n\nNot disclosed.\nAbbott follows all applicable regulations in the countries where we conduct clinical studies or register products. We also follow nationally and internationally accepted standards, such as the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Good Clinical Practices (ICH GCP), the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Organization for Standardization\u2019s ISO 14155, ISO 20916 and other standards. We train employees and clinical sites on the proper conduct of clinical studies and employ both external and internal oversight of studies.\n\nWhen planning our clinical studies, Abbott identifies and reduces controllable risks to patients. Either our Institutional Review Board (IRB) or our Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) reviews any proposed research prior to commencement to assure patient protections. The informed consent procedures and consent form documents for any clinical study must conform to all relevant legal statutes and governmental regulations. During the course of a study, patients can report any concerns to the IRB. We monitor our studies on an ongoing basis to ensure compliance with Abbott standards and identify any unforeseen risks to patient safety. This includes audits of contract research organizations (CROs) that conduct or manage studies on behalf of Abbott. If Abbott becomes aware of study misconduct, we report it to the appropriate authorities. No GCP inspections by regulatory agencies of the company or clinical trial investigators led to fines, penalties, warning letters or product seizures in 2021.\n\nAbbott registers all applicable and/or covered clinical trials, regardless of outcome, in a publicly accessible clinical trials registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. For branded generic pharmaceuticals, this means that we register interventional clinical studies in patients as designated by national laws and regulations. For medical devices and diagnostics, this means we register interventional clinical studies of health outcomes and pediatric post-marketing surveillance studies, as designated by national laws and regulations.\n\nAbbott is committed to transparency and sharing important information about the clinical trials we sponsor. We recognize that there are important public health benefits to making clinical trial information available to healthcare providers, patients and the public. Our registrations and results disclosures adhere to all applicable national laws and regulations in countries where we operate.\n\nAbbott discloses the results of all applicable or covered clinical trials as described above, regardless of outcome, in a publicly accessible clinical trials results database, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. We also report the results of any exploratory pharmaceutical clinical studies if the findings have significant medical importance, such as with important safety findings.\n\nThe regulatory environment around sharing clinical trial data for research purposes is evolving. We continually engage with stakeholders\u2019 different approaches for sharing clinical trial data with scientific and medical researchers to advance medical science, while protecting confidential information.\nTalent management is overseen by our Executive Vice President, Human Resources \u2014 who reports directly to our President and CEO \u2014 and corporate officers, all of whom carry talent management goals. We engage organizations such as Advancing Minorities\u2019 Interest in Engineering and the Society of Women Engineers to identify diverse talent. Partnerships with academic institutions like Howard University and North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University also support our future employee pipeline.\n\nOur career site employs artificial intelligence to enhance the application process, streamlining user experiences with tailored content and a personalized chatbot to help identify roles. In 2021, Abbott hired 26,184 new employees. We strive to increase the number of women in our leadership ranks and across our many STEM roles. The annual Society of Women Engineers conference offers an opportunity to connect with the brightest female minds in the industry. At the 2021 event, we successfully recruited a number of excellent new hires.\n\nAs well as supporting those who already work for Abbott, we want to give the next generation opportunities to get a foot on the industry ladder. Through our STEM internship program, we offer high school students \u2014 particularly female and minority applicants \u2014 an opportunity to kick-start a career in healthcare.\n\nHC-BP-330a.2: (1) Voluntary and (2) involuntary turnover rate for (a) executives/senior managers, (b) midlevel managers, (c) professionals and (d) all others.\n\nSee page 91 in the Key Social Metrics of the Appendix.\n\nThe total energy consumption (Scope 1 and 2) in 2021 was 14,126,000 gigajoules. The total electricity purchased was 4,538,000 gigajoules. Abbott\u2019s total energy consumption that is sourced from the grid totals 27%.\n\n| 2021 Electricity Purchased | % of grid-sourced electricity | 85% |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------|-----|\n| % of renewable energy purchased | 15% |\n\nIn 2021, each of Abbott\u2019s 22 NOVs were related to wastewater discharges from one of our manufacturing plants. To address the issue, Abbott has a comprehensive action plan in place and is expediting long-term sustainable controls.\n\nNo inherent water-related risks with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on the business have been identified. To address water-related risks and ensure our business\u2019 resilience, Abbott\u2019s Business Continuity and Crisis Management, EHS, Engineering and Supply Chain organizations work to implement measures which allow us to ensure business continuity and minimize the financial impacts from physical water-related risks. Likewise, a core part of Abbott\u2019s business strategy includes reducing our water footprint in our operations and engaging our value chain in strategic sourcing categories.\nAbbott is committed to packaging optimization through sustainable design. In order to better understand opportunities for more sustainable packaging, teams in our Nutrition business unit conducted an analysis of their packaging portfolio to establish a baseline. Abbott looks to expand this effort in our other business units in the coming years. In 2021, our Nutrition business (1) utilized 138,000 U.S. tons of material to place 3.7 billion packages on market, (2) made 19% of packaging from recycled and/or renewable materials and (3) estimated that 65% of its packaging is recyclable, reusable and/or compostable.\n\nWe recognize the impact our packaging has on the environment today in the form of resource use, related emissions and waste production. We are rethinking how we design packaging to optimize material use and keep materials in circulation for as long as possible. To reduce raw material burden, we are optimizing efficiency by minimizing the volume and weight of our packaging. We are also employing circularity principles to incorporate increased quantities of recycled content and designing for recyclability, reusability and increasingly positive impact.\n\nTo address 50 million pounds of packaging through high-impact sustainable design programs, we need a plan of action. Our Sustainable Packaging Guiding Principles \u2014 recently created by the Sustainable Packaging Council \u2014 inform changes to assisting packaging and target new designs that integrate sustainability from the very beginning.\n\n| Our Guiding Principles | Optimize Material Efficiency |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Eliminate unnecessary components | Reduce packaging materials |\n\n| Employ Circularity Principles |\n|-----------------------------|\n| Replace problematic materials | Design for disassembly |\n| Design for recyclability | Design for reuse |\n| Utilize renewable materials | Integrate recycled content |\n\n| Balance All Aspects of Packaging Systems Holistically |\n|-----------------------------|\n| Optimize cube efficiency | Provide consumer direction |\n| Improve carbon footprint |\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Response\n\nMANAGING RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nWe committed to identifying and mitigating climate-related risks with potential to impact our operations, supply chain and distribution network. We maintain an identification process for opportunities to address emerging climate change-related healthcare needs and increase operating efficiencies by reducing climate-related impacts. We have determined that climate-related risks and opportunities exist at site and regional levels but are limited at a global scale.\n\nRISKS\n\nWe analyze physical and transitional risks resulting from emerging regulation and new supplier/customer expectations of our businesses and risk exposure. We assess and manage them through our integrated company-wide risk management process, which identifies opportunities to build resilience in both our operations and our business model. We regularly update risk management policies, standards and programs to align with global best practices and regulatory requirements, and aim to anticipate emerging risks and upcoming regulatory changes. Our enterprise risk management (ERM) process identifies and evaluates the most critical business risks and provides guidance to our Board of Directors and management team.\n\nThe EHS Governance team monitors emerging climate-related trends and regulations to analyze potential impacts and risk exposure, and develop appropriate management strategies. Our EHS, Economics, Business Continuity and Supply Chain organizations use scenario-sensitivity risk modeling to understand the financial implications of climate-related risks. Abbott\u2019s Business Continuity and Crisis Management organizations implement measures to ensure business continuity and minimize the financial impacts of physical climate-related risks. These physical risks fall into two categories: acute and chronic.\n\n- Acute physical risks associated with climate change include unforeseen extreme weather events for which we cannot develop preventative strategies. We have developed strategies for mitigating and responding to them across our value chain. Our Business Continuity and Crisis Management organization works with our EHS, Engineering and Supply Chains groups to strengthen business resiliency against weather events and other forms of extreme disruption. During the COVID-19 pandemic and strict travel restrictions, our processes enabled us to quickly produce millions of COVID-19 tests while continuing to provide our other essential products to people globally.\n\n- Our Engineering and EHS policies and management standards consider chronic physical risks, such as water scarcity, and require sites to conduct regular risk and opportunity evaluations and implement mitigation strategies. Climate-related risk analyses conclude that Abbott is not exposed to physical risks that could generate a substantive change in business operations, revenue or expenditure at a corporate level. While limited physical risks exist at site and regional operation levels and throughout our supply chain, our diverse geographical distribution significantly mitigates the potential for substantive business impact.\n\nOur most significant climate-related risks are transition risks that relate to emerging expectations and regulations around GHG emission management. These include carbon limits and taxes, enhanced reporting obligations, costs to transition to lower-emissions technologies, and increased costs of goods and services. We have identified the need to manage and mitigate environmental impacts as a potential enterprise risk. In response to this, our business strategy includes reducing operational energy and carbon footprint, and engaging our value chain in strategic sourcing categories.\n\nOPPORTUNITIES\n\nAs part of our product research and development (R&D) and climate risk management processes, we consider climate change-related opportunities. These fall into two main categories:\n\n- Increased operating efficiencies through achieving carbon reduction targets\n\n- The opportunity to advance our mission to help people live their best lives by meeting changing healthcare and nutrition needs\nCompared with many industries, Abbott\u2019s carbon footprint is relatively small, reducing opportunities to achieve significant improvements in operating efficiencies and cost savings. Although opportunities exist and are incorporated into our 2030 Sustainability Plan, they are unlikely to have a substantive financial impact on our business.\n\nClimate changes have the potential to influence disease burden and result in increased need for the diagnostics, medical devices, nutrition products and pharmaceuticals that Abbott makes. Our 2030 Sustainability Plan commits us to continually respond to increased humanitarian needs due to severe weather events, new disease threats and changes in the spread of disease. We will do so in line with our priority of innovating for access and affordability, which has characterized our company\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We do not anticipate that changes to the disease burden resulting from climate change will have a substantive financial or strategic impact on our business beyond this. We will continue to respond to these in line with our caring value and primarily through our philanthropic organization and product donations.\n\n**Disclosure 2021 Response**\n\n**a) Describe the Board\u2019s oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities.**\n\nAbbott is committed to strong corporate governance that aligns with shareholder interests. Our Board of Directors has an integral role in leading our sustainability activities. For more details on its oversight of climate risks and opportunities, see page 42 of the Environment section and Abbott\u2019s CDP Climate Change 2021 Response: CDP C.1.b.\n\n**b) Describe management\u2019s role in assessing/managing climate-related risks and opportunities.**\n\nAbbott\u2019s commitment to sustainable business starts at the top and is integrated across our organization. The management team leads our sustainability activities alongside the Board. See page 77 of the Governance section and CDP C.12, C.2.1, C.3, C.3.1a for more information.\n\n**Strategy**\n\n**a) Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium, and long term.**\n\nThrough Abbott\u2019s risk management processes, we have identified that climate-related risks and opportunities exist at site and regional operation levels and in our supply chain. However, Abbott is not exposed to any material climate-related risks or opportunities. Through Abbott\u2019s diversified geographical distribution and the various initiatives that we have implemented to reduce our carbon emissions and improve operational efficiency, the potential impact for climate change-related physical and regulatory risks to be material to our business is significantly lessened. Regarding the products that we supply, changes to the climate have the potential to influence the disease burden and result in increased need for the pharmaceutical, diagnostics, medical device and nutrition products that Abbott makes. However, we do not anticipate that this will have a material financial or strategic impact on our business. For more information, see CDP C.2.1a, C.2.1b, C.2.2, C.2.2a, C.2.3b and C.3.4b.\n\n**Risk Management**\n\n**a) Describe the organization\u2019s process for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.**\n\nAbbott is committed to mitigating climate-related risks that have the potential to impact our operations, supply chain and distribution network. These include potential physical risks, as well as emerging transition risks. We have a multi-disciplinary company-wide risk management process, which assesses climate-related risks across the organization to ensure that our businesses and operations are resilient. For more details on our process for identifying and assessing risks, see CDP C.2.1a, C.2.1b, C.2.2 and C.2.2a.\n\n**b) Describe the organization\u2019s processes for managing climate-related risks.**\n\nAbbott has a robust process for managing the potential physical and transition risks identified in our assessment process. We have several tools, committees and organizations that identify and manage these risks. See CDP C.2.1a, C.2.1b and C.2.2 for more details.\n\n**Metrics and Targets**\n\n**a) Describe the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process.**\n\nWe track a number of climate-related metrics, in addition to our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions for our carbon footprint. For these metrics, see CDP C.4.2b and C.9.1, page 93 of the Energy and Emissions section and page 93 of the Appendix.\n\n**b) Describe Scope 1, Scope 2 and, if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the related risks.**\n\nUnder our 2030 Sustainability Plan, we have set new targets to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and are developing a target for Scope 3 emissions. To track these, we disclose our carbon footprint for all three scopes annually. For these metrics and related risks, see CDP C.6.1, C.6.3 and C.6.5, page 44 of the Energy and Emissions section, and page 93 of the Appendix.\n\n**c) Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets.**\n\nWe have set several targets to track our performance and assess and manage our risks and opportunities, including for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, with a forthcoming Scope 3 target. See page 43 of the Energy and Emissions section and page 93 of the Appendix for more information.\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG) Index\n\nIn assessing what sustainability means to Abbott, we monitor how our priorities and material issues align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) published by the United Nations. The following examples represent some of the many ways in which our work to help people live better and healthier lives intersects with the SDGs.\n\n**TARGET 1.1 / 1.5**\n\n**WHY IT MATTERS**\n\nWe are committed to developing accessible products that are affordable for the people who need them. Even as we invest in innovation, we are finding ways to prevent passing costs on to customers.

We believe waste management responsibility extends beyond the manufacturing phase, and are committed to staying accountable for impacts at each point of a product\u2019s journey.\n\n2030 ABBOTT GOAL\n\u2022 Address 50 million pounds of packaging through high-impact sustainable design programs that: employ circularity principles through smart design and material selection; eliminate and reduce materials; improve the energy efficiency of Abbott\u2019s products; optimize packaging, pallet and truckload efficiency.\n\u2022 Reduce waste impacts using a circular economy approach to achieve and maintain at least a 90% waste diversion rate.\n\u2022 Engage with key suppliers to reduce the environmental impact of materials supplied to Abbott that become waste in our operations.\n\nPROGRESS AND 2021 STORIES\nResponsibility in Procurement\nIn 2021, we expanded the Supply Chain Sustainability team within our Global Procurement organization, and continued partnering with Operations, Supply Chain and EHS functions to manage our supply chain sustainability strategy, governance and programming. We also established a network of Sustainability Liaisons to act as representatives for each of our businesses in support of our 2030 targets and supply chain initiatives.\n\nWaste Management Progress\nWhile waste production did increase in 2021 due to increased production, as well as an increase in construction waste from expansion projects to allow for production growth, seven manufacturing facilities and one non-manufacturing facility received Zero Waste-to-Landfill certification, bringing our total number of facilities certified through this program to 38 manufacturing and eight non-manufacturing facilities.\n\nWe follow the principles of reduce, reuse, recycle.\n\u2022 Reduce: At both the Abbott Park corporate headquarters and our Core Diagnostics operations in Illinois, we started an initiative in March of 2021 to reduce the generation of waste from these sites by sending baled corrugated cardboard to a third party for beneficial use.\n\u2022 Reuse: In Costa Rica, we have updated procedures to allow for the reuse of shipping containers.\n\u2022 Recycle: In one of our U.S. nutrition plants, we have invested in machinery to enable on-site breaking down of fiber drums to support better recycling of each component.\n\nSee page 49 of Abbott\u2019s Environment section for more information.\nWHY IT MATTERS\n\nWe are committed to safeguarding a healthier planet for everyone. One way we do this is by reducing our emissions, finding more efficient ways to use energy and limiting reliance on fossil fuels.\n\n2030 ABBOTT GOAL\n\n\u2022 Reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% compared to our 2018 baseline. This aligns our sustainability plan with the objectives of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n\u2022 We are developing a 2030 target for Scope 3 emissions and will work with our key carbon-intensive suppliers to implement sustainable programs to reduce these emissions.\n\nPROGRESS AND 2021 STORIES\n\nEmission Reductions\nThroughout 2021, absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions increased by 3.3% compared to 2020. When adjusted for sales, Scope 1 and 2 emissions decreased 17% over this same time period. In 2021, as our products \u2014 including COVID testing and diagnostics \u2014 became increasingly important for patients and healthcare workers globally, we expanded production, which has come with a rise in emissions.\n\nEnergy Efficiency\nTo reduce energy demand, we have made several energy-efficient improvements as retrofits to existing equipment or through active in-house energy management. Several sites use energy data and innovative methods to identify and quantify energy inefficiencies in manufacturing processes, often employing external experts. These insights then inform a list of priority energy demand reduction projects across the global business. For example, in Indonesia, many of our motors have been upgraded with variable speed drives, reducing energy requirements while retaining performance.\n\nRenewable Energy\nWe are committed to purchasing a greater proportion of electricity from renewable sources and are developing a Renewable Energy Procurement initiative to drive continuous improvement in this area. In 2021, we purchased 190 million kWh of low-carbon and renewable energy, resulting in savings of 80,000 metric tons of CO\u2082e. In addition, we also generated 1.8 million kWh from solar installations at eight of our sites.\n\nSee page 45 of Abbott\u2019s Environment section for more information on our 2021 progress for climate action and our latest CDP Climate Change response.\nPARTNERSHIPS FOR THE GOALS\nSTRENGTHEN THE MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION\nAND REVITALIZE THE GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP\nFOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT\n\nTARGET\n17.6 / 17.17\n\nWHY IT MATTERS\nCollaboration is key to mitigating shared impacts. We work side by side with those we serve, governments and other stakeholders to address health disparities and barriers to equitable healthcare access. By nurturing partnerships that are resilient and responsible, and that leave lasting positive impact, we multiply our ability to touch people\u2019s lives while safeguarding the planet.\n\n2030 ABBOTT GOAL\n\u2022 Advance health equity through partnership.\n\u2022 Partner with stakeholders to improve health outcomes by advancing standards and building access to affordable, integrated solutions.\n\nPROGRESS AND 2021 STORIES\nSupply Chain Partnerships\nIn 2021, 210 suppliers covering 25% spend were engaged through Abbott\u2019s Supplier Sustainability Survey. We also updated the survey to better understand risks and opportunities in line with current and emerging sustainability-related issues and our 2030 goals.\n\nAccess and Affordability Partnerships\nThe Health Equity Bill of Rights \u2014 established by the American Diabetes Association\u00ae (ADA) \u2014 posits ten basic rights for people with diabetes and prediabetes. We have sponsored a pilot initiative designed by the ADA to address right #9: The right to the latest medical advances.\n\nToday, Black Americans are 60% more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes, yet much less likely to have their condition well managed. The goal of our three-year, $5 million effort is to reduce health inequities by removing barriers to tools and technology for diabetes management regardless of income level or insurance status. The pilot seeks to better understand and address the healthcare disparities for Black people living with diabetes. Focusing initial efforts in Columbus, Ohio, we will help by sponsoring campaigns to enhance awareness, access to, and adoption of these tools. In collaboration with the National Center for Urban Solutions (NCUS), 150 Black residents living with diabetes will have access to health education, physical training, nutritional support and Abbott\u2019s FreeStyle Libre flash glucose monitoring technology.\n\nSee page 18 of Abbott\u2019s Access and Affordability section for more information.\n", "source": "abbott_laboratories_2021", "added": "2025-04-27", "created": "2025-04-27", "metadata": {"Source-File": "climate_reports/tp_reports/abbott_laboratories_2021.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.1.59", "pdf-total-pages": 142, "total-input-tokens": 325747, "total-output-tokens": 93925, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 2722, 2], [2722, 6329, 3], [6329, 7614, 4], [7614, 9498, 5], [9498, 12645, 6], [12645, 15066, 7], [15066, 17156, 8], [17156, 17693, 9], [17693, 20980, 10], [20980, 24957, 11], [24957, 28106, 12], [28106, 30964, 13], [30964, 32785, 14], [32785, 34047, 15], [34047, 35731, 16], [35731, 38674, 17], [38674, 44038, 18], [44038, 47265, 19], [47265, 50044, 20], [50044, 54012, 21], [54012, 55104, 22], [55104, 58761, 23], [58761, 59793, 24], [59793, 61408, 25], [61408, 65253, 26], [65253, 68981, 27], [68981, 71245, 28], [71245, 72536, 29], [72536, 73837, 30], [73837, 78757, 31], [78757, 82395, 32], [82395, 85778, 33], [85778, 88678, 34], [88678, 92509, 35], [92509, 96573, 36], [96573, 100102, 37], [100102, 103502, 38], [103502, 108419, 39], [108419, 109069, 40], [109069, 110018, 41], [110018, 113295, 42], [113295, 114854, 43], [114854, 117333, 44], [117333, 121714, 45], [121714, 123869, 46], [123869, 125748, 47], [125748, 130745, 48], [130745, 132883, 49], [132883, 136485, 50], [136485, 140453, 51], [140453, 144229, 52], [144229, 145321, 53], [145321, 149498, 54], [149498, 153157, 55], [153157, 154014, 56], [154014, 156823, 57], [156823, 161683, 58], [161683, 163791, 59], [163791, 168077, 60], [168077, 168917, 61], [168917, 169872, 62], [169872, 171289, 63], [171289, 174678, 64], [174678, 178141, 65], [178141, 179529, 66], [179529, 181808, 67], [181808, 185215, 68], [185215, 188545, 69], [188545, 191057, 70], [191057, 193594, 71], [193594, 198379, 72], [198379, 202912, 73], [202912, 203667, 74], [203667, 206515, 75], [206515, 209302, 76], [209302, 214571, 77], [214571, 218390, 78], [218390, 221605, 79], [221605, 224036, 80], [224036, 226917, 81], [226917, 228905, 82], [228905, 232201, 83], [232201, 232906, 84], [232906, 236340, 85], [236340, 236340, 86], [236340, 239473, 87], [239473, 241473, 88], [241473, 244825, 89], [244825, 246129, 90], [246129, 247274, 91], [247274, 249332, 92], [249332, 252198, 93], [252198, 254651, 94], [254651, 256159, 95], [256159, 258728, 96], [258728, 261979, 97], [261979, 264950, 98], [264950, 267721, 99], [267721, 270949, 100], [270949, 274174, 101], [274174, 277420, 102], [277420, 278503, 103], [278503, 279654, 104], [279654, 280761, 105], [280761, 283297, 106], [283297, 284853, 107], [284853, 286876, 108], [286876, 287925, 109], [287925, 290955, 110], [290955, 292611, 111], [292611, 294296, 112], [294296, 295258, 113], [295258, 299282, 114], [299282, 303738, 115], [303738, 306374, 116], [306374, 310943, 117], [310943, 314804, 118], [314804, 318333, 119], [318333, 324558, 120], [324558, 325522, 121], [325522, 328706, 122], [328706, 336035, 123], [336035, 340537, 124], [340537, 345538, 125], [345538, 350010, 126], [350010, 353230, 127], [353230, 356055, 128], [356055, 358162, 129], [358162, 362347, 130], [362347, 367829, 131], [367829, 369764, 132], [369764, 371094, 133], [371094, 373063, 134], [373063, 375355, 135], [375355, 378277, 136], [378277, 380142, 137], [380142, 383183, 138], [383183, 385826, 139], [385826, 388033, 140], [388033, 390335, 141], [390335, 390335, 142]]}}
