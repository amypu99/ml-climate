We demonstrate our commitment in many ways, including through significant progress in reducing GHG emissions from our operations. We are helping our customers achieve their climate-related goals by continuing to invest in new products, technologies and services that facilitate fuel flexibility, increased operational efficiency and reduced emissions. We updated our enterprise strategy to include sustainability as a strategic focus area, together with operational excellence, expanded offerings and services \u2014 given the opportunities presented by the energy transition and our work to help our customers achieve their climate-related objectives.\n\n2022 Highlights\n\n- 25+ years of mining autonomously with over 5 billion tonnes of material moved and about 30% improvement in productivity\n- 19% increase in sales and revenues from remanufactured products from 2018\n- Transforming Tucson Proving Ground into a working mine site of the future\nOUR ROLE IN THE ENERGY TRANSITION\n\nThe energy transition is one of the world\u2019s challenges, but one that presents numerous opportunities. This is especially true for Caterpillar, as we develop products and services designed to support the energy transition and growing energy demand.\n\nBuilding Infrastructure\nOur construction equipment helps build the infrastructure for the energy transition. Our mining equipment supports the increased demand in critical materials, such as copper, lithium, nickel and cobalt, required for electric vehicles, battery storage, wind and solar power, and grid modernization and stability.\n\nOptimizing Natural Gas\nNatural gas is expected to play an important role in the transition to renewable energy. Our reciprocating engines and gas turbines are widely used across the globe in upstream natural gas production and transmission.\n\nEnhancing Energy Reliability\nIncreasing renewable power in electric grids creates opportunities for distributed power generation. Customers utilize our reciprocating engine generator sets and gas turbines to support electric grid stability.\n\nIncreasing Alternative Fuels\nWe offer machines and engines that are capable of operating on alternative fuels such as hydrogen, biogas, hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and biodiesel, while continuing to develop technologies for the future.\n\nRead our CLIMATE & ENERGY STATEMENT\nHELPING OUR CUSTOMERS BUILD A BETTER, MORE SUSTAINABLE WORLD\n\nNow more than ever, our customers rely on us to provide diverse products, services and technology that help lower GHG emissions, improve efficiency and productivity and deliver energy flexibility. We are here to support our customers\u2019 needs in their sustainability journey.\n\nOver the past 20 years, we have invested more than $30 billion in R&D to deliver best-in-class innovation, including autonomy, alternative fuels, connectivity and digital, and electrification (AACE) technologies. We integrate the energy technologies developed by our Energy & Transportation (E&T) segment into machines manufactured by our Resource Industries (RI) and Construction Industries (CI) segments, providing an advantage to our customers as we help them achieve their objectives. Going forward, we will continue to invest in these areas as we work with customers to help further their sustainability objectives.\n\nAutonomous Technology\nCaterpillar leads the industry in autonomy. We have the largest autonomous truck fleet in the world, with over 580 machines and more launching every year. Autonomy drives operations consistency for our customers \u2014 resulting in zero reported lost-time injuries, productivity improvement of up to 30% over staffed fleets, enhancing fuel efficiency, and reducing associated GHG emissions. Today, our autonomous portfolio goes beyond haul trucks to include water trucks, drills, dozers, wheel loaders and underground loaders \u2014 all of which can be operated remotely from thousands of miles away.\n\nUsing expertise gained from Caterpillar\u2019s collaboration with customer Rio Tinto to develop the Cat 789 at its Gudai-Darri iron ore mine in Western Australia, Caterpillar introduced the fully autonomous Cat 777G water solutions truck in 2022. The 777G integrates a truck, tank and water delivery system with Cat technology to help manage the site with enhanced safety and productivity while using less water to control dust at mining and quarry sites.\n\nAlternative Fuels\nFuel choice is one way that customers can reduce lifecycle GHG emissions today. Many Caterpillar products operate on lower-carbon intensity fuels, including biodiesel, renewable diesel and biogas. These fuels reduce lifecycle GHG emissions in the fuel value chain; GHG emissions at the tailpipe are essentially the same as traditional fuels.\n\nFor example, all Caterpillar diesel engines can operate on 100% HVO. This includes the Cat C-Series engines a Swedish commercial and industrial equipment supplier uses to power its mining and construction equipment. In 2022, the supplier completed testing its range of machines to confirm they can operate with HVO without modifications to the engines or the fuel tanks.\nIn addition, Caterpillar engines operating on natural gas blended with up to 100% hydrogen are being demonstrated in power generation projects today; turbines can operate on up to 100% hydrogen. These and other projects are helping to demonstrate the viability of potential fuel sources like hydrogen while the infrastructure to support availability of renewable hydrogen is being developed.\n\nIn the maritime industry, we\u2019re committed to supporting our customers\u2019 climate-related objectives through methanol-powered solutions, which are efficient, cost-effective, and meet Caterpillar fuel standards.\n\nAccordingly, Caterpillar Marine joined the Green Maritime Methanol consortium in 2022, teaming up with other companies to streamline the adoption of methanol as a maritime transport fuel. Green methanol, an important candidate as a future fuel for the shipping industry, is easily stored aboard ships and can provide lower carbon intensity.\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s investment in lean burn natural gas technology, microgrid controls, and energy storage has provided our customers flexibility to utilize alternative energy technologies and the opportunity for customers to reduce their carbon footprint. Exploration drilling has historically been powered by diesel or dynamic gas blending (DGB) technology, which consumes diesel and natural gas. Now with a fully integrated solution, Caterpillar can provide customers with a 100% natural gas solution, combining the best from its lean burn engines and microgrid technologies. Drilling rigs powered by Cat natural gas generators, such as the G3512, paired with an energy storage system provide customers with the same industry leading responsiveness experienced with Cat diesel engines. The benefits include a reduction of up to 80% nitric oxide, 11% CO2, and up to 30% engine runtime. With the ability to run on field gas, this gas hybrid solution can reduce the need for flaring while creating a fuel cost savings of up to 85% and reducing operational GHG emissions.\n\nConnectivity\nFor more than 20 years, Caterpillar has been connecting machines and using telematics to create machine insights. The data from 1.4 million connected assets helps customers operate their fleets more efficiently to optimize productivity and conserve resources such as fuel.\n\nWhen in search of ways to sustainably provide seafood in the future, it makes sense to do so in a manner that minimizes the operation\u2019s environmental footprint. This is why California-based Pacific6 Enterprises has turned to Caterpillar Marine to pilot a parallel battery hybrid propulsion system for a first-of-its-kind aquaculture farming vessel. Powered by a Cat C18 engine, this next-generation hybrid architecture boat will leverage proven electrical systems and integrated components from Caterpillar\u2019s construction and mining product lines.\n\nThe vessel will be equipped with 961 kWh of battery capacity, supplied by Caterpillar to help enable zero-exhaust emissions when operating solely on battery power in both farming operations and port departure and entry. Caterpillar Marine also will provide the complete integration of the hybrid propulsion system, reducing the number of installed diesel engines from two to one.\nCaterpillar designed batteries can power a variety of industrial applications. Numerous products using electrification are currently in development, including 48V, 300V, and 600V batteries and four battery electric machine prototypes \u2014 the 301.9 mini excavator, 320 medium excavator, 950 GC medium wheel loader and 906 compact wheel loader. The machines are powered by Cat battery prototypes and include an onboard AC charger. The lithium-ion battery range features a modular design that offers flexible configurations across multiple applications. The batteries are engineered to be scalable to industry and customer performance needs and maximize sustainability throughout their lifecycle, including recycle and reuse at the end of life.\n\n**Regulatory Compliance**\n\nIn addition to investments in new technologies to support the energy transition, we\u2019re committed to ensuring traditionally powered machines and equipment are as efficient as possible and compliant with stringent emissions regulations. Caterpillar provides U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Tier 4 Final, European Union (EU) Stage V or equivalent products in North America, Europe, and select regions around the world. These products provide up to a 90% reduction in emissions (nitrogen oxides and particulate matter) compared to U.S. EPA Tier 3 or EU Stage IIIA emission standards. Product improvements in each segment provide customers with cost-saving benefits of improved fuel efficiency and fuel flexibility. Modular offerings allow customization of products to optimize technology.\n\n**Electrification**\n\nCaterpillar is committed to delivering robust electrified products and solutions for our customers. We are gaining valuable experience from our initial introductions of battery-powered equipment and the additional battery-powered machines and chargers under development will help our customers achieve their climate-related objectives. Electric drivetrains and hybrid powertrains employ an electric drive transmission with power components to improve energy efficiency and productivity. The Cat D11 XE4 dozer, for example, harnesses the power and efficiency of an electric drive. Now in full production, the dozer\u2019s electric drive system provides constant power to the ground with continuous pushing and greater maneuverability, leading to faster cycle times and improved fuel efficiency compared to previous models.\n\nFor mining customers, the electric Cat R1700 XE LHD offers 100% battery electric propulsion, producing zero-exhaust emissions and significantly less heat than a reciprocating engine powered model for underground mining operations. The new underground LHD supports customers seeking reduced-carbon opportunities.\n\n**BIG PROJECT, BIG BENEFITS**\n\nA large-scale project high in the Austrian Alps demonstrates the role of Cat construction machines in supporting the energy transition. The Kuhtai Dam project is Europe\u2019s largest current construction site, carries a $1 billion price tag and spans two 3,000-meter-high mountains. When complete in 2026, the dam will store more than 33 million cubic meters of water that will power a hydroelectric plant to provide a significant amount of renewable energy for the region.\n\nIt\u2019s a job for which Cat machines are uniquely suited, based on prior deployments at high altitudes and in even colder mining conditions. Caterpillar and Cat dealer Zeppelin worked closely with the customer to cover every detail and special need: from ensuring that all 16 new machines arrived at the site in a timely manner to modifying the equipment to accommodate the mountainous terrain to deploying fast fueling technology.\n\nWe added to our software portfolio in 2022 with the acquisition of Tangent Energy Solutions, which provides customers turnkey solutions for reducing energy costs, monetizing electric grid support, and providing resiliency for customer operations. Tangent Energy\u2019s proprietary software solutions monitor patterns from grid and client facilities, analyze opportunities in energy markets, and dispatch resources to maximize returns without disrupting normal business operations.\n\nTo learn about more product highlights and recent announcements, see our sustainability news.\nWHERE THE FUTURE OF MINING IS NOW\n\nIn support of the energy transition, Caterpillar is investing to transform our Tucson Proving Ground, located in Green Valley, Arizona, into a working, sustainable \u201cmine site of the future\u201d by installing and utilizing a variety of renewable energy sources. The objective is to implement the same sustainability solutions that mining companies will use at their own operations and learn firsthand what it takes to run an electrified mine site and effectively support customers through the energy transition.\n\nThe transformation of the Tucson Proving Ground allows us to better demonstrate our energy transition commitments and serve as an advisor to customers as we navigate the integration of new technologies together. The site will leverage a variety of renewable power sources, including wind and solar, capable of powering the facility and its products as they become electrified. In addition, the transformation of the facility will serve as a learning platform for optimizing charging and energy management integration.\n\nBATTERY ELECTRIC MINING TRUCK ACCELERATED DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY\n\nCaterpillar demonstrated its first battery electric 793 large mining truck prototype in 2022 as part of a growing portfolio of innovative electrified solutions with support from key mining customers participating in Caterpillar\u2019s Early Learner program. The program focuses on accelerating the development and validation of Cat battery electric trucks at participating customers\u2019 sites. This approach supports the climate-related objectives of the program\u2019s participants, including BHP, Freeport-McMoRan, Newmont Corporation, Rio Tinto and Teck Resources Limited. A primary objective of the program is for Caterpillar to collaborate more closely with customers as the industry undergoes transformational change through the energy transition.\n\n| PROTOTYPE | EARLY LEARNER | PILOT | PRODUCTION |\n|-----------|---------------|-------|------------|\n| 2022      | 2024          | 2025  | 2027+      |\n| \u2022 Machine technical feasibility | \u2022 Product and technology validation | \u2022 Fleet optimization | \u2022 Full production capabilities |\n| \u2022 Validate technical assumptions | \u2022 Refine requirements | \u2022 Validate production intent | \u2022 Site Integration |\n|           | \u2022 Process development | \u2022 Infrastructure learnings |           |\nSUPPORTING A CIRCULAR ECONOMY\n\nCaterpillar products are built to be rebuilt. They are designed to withstand heavy-duty operating conditions and to be restored and used for multiple lifecycles, reducing the need for raw materials and associated GHG emissions. Designing products and components to be used throughout multiple service lifecycles is the essence of our remanufacturing approach across multiple products and brands.\n\nRemanufacturing Goal\n\nIncrease sales and revenues from remanufacturing offerings by 25% from 2018 to 2030.\n\n19% increase in sales and revenues from remanufactured products from 2018\n\nData includes remanufacturing offerings provided by Cat Reman, Progress Rail, Solar Turbines, Caterpillar Energy Solutions and Caterpillar Defense.\n\n*It is recommended to replace before failure. Replacements after failure may result in partial credit.\nIn March 1973, Caterpillar established itself as the first company in the United States (U.S.) with its own diesel truck engine remanufacturing plant and released the first direct injection truck engine from its assembly line. Prior to that, an aging diesel truck engine in the United States was usually replaced with a new one after it passed the 120,000-mile mark. That changed, thanks to Caterpillar. In the years following, the Cat Reman product line expanded to encompass most of the industries Caterpillar serves today. Less energy and material are needed because we don\u2019t have to harvest and assemble all the raw material required for new. We\u2019re starting with core parts that can be reused \u2014 not manufacturing a completely new part. Rather, the remanufacturing process uses the existing resource to build it back to like-new condition.\n\nThrough Cat Reman:\n\n- **140M** pounds of material taken back in 2022\n- **89%** end-of-life eligible returns collected\n\nSustainability Benefits of Remanufacturing:\n\n- **65-87%** less greenhouse gas process emissions\n- **80-90%** less new materials used\n- **65-87%** less process energy use\n\n---\n\n1.

By weight.\nSolar Turbines\nSolar Turbines remanufactures turbine components to support the overhaul business. Through advanced remanufacturing processes, components are returned to like-new condition. Once components have been certified, they are used in major assemblies and integrated into the overhaul engine exchange fleet. This allows customers to exchange their engines in days rather than months of downtime. A similar process is used to remanufacture our gas compressor components.\n\nThe exchange equipment is tested and certified to the same performance and emission specifications as new equipment and may receive the latest enhancements and design improvements, as required. Solar continues to expand remanufacturing capabilities and invest in condition-based engineering, which allows for more finite determination of remaining useful life. Condition-based engineering improves remanufactured content and extends overhaul cycles while ensuring quality at every step.\n\nThe company has made significant investments in internal repair and remanufacturing capability. Additionally, Solar partners with its suppliers to remanufacture and extend the life of various turbomachinery components. As a result, Solar\u2019s remanufactured content has grown steadily over the years and provides significant support to overhauled turbomachinery equipment worldwide. The company also continues to invest in facilities around the world to expand capabilities with the goal of reducing transportation and providing a faster customer response.\n\nCat Reman\nCat equipment is built to last. It is designed to withstand heavy-duty operating conditions and to be restored and used for multiple lifecycles. Cat Reman gives materials a new life, delivers sustainability benefits to our customers and helps Caterpillar contribute to the circular economy. Caterpillar has been remanufacturing for 50 years of our nearly 100 years in business. Today, remanufacturing is at the heart of our strategy to help customers build a better, more sustainable world.\n\nWhen a component reaches the end of its initial serviceable life, a dealer can return the used component, or core, to Caterpillar. That core is cleaned, inspected, salvaged and remanufactured to original factory quality and performance specifications. This includes any relevant engineering updates. Cat Reman uses state-of-the-art salvage techniques, strict reuse guidelines, and advanced remanufacturing processes and quality controls to ensure that remanufactured products provide like-new performance, coupled with a same-as-new warranty. That means when a customer purchases a Cat Reman product, they\u2019re getting an affordable, accessible product that performs like new \u2014 and one they can say supports a circular economy. Their total cost of ownership can be lower, too, after a qualifying core return and core deposit refund.1\n\nWe work together throughout our primary segments \u2014 CI, RI and E&T \u2014 to expand the enterprise\u2019s offerings to our customers, lower their costs and provide quick turnarounds. Remanufacturing is a true \u201cwin-win\u201d for both our customers and the company.\n\nProgress Rail\nProgress Rail extends the use of existing locomotives by providing rebuild, overhaul and repower options. These modernization programs upgrade electrical and mechanical systems and other components to extend locomotive life by 10 years or more with appropriate maintenance. We also offer reconditioning or repair services for freight cars and a wide range of components, ensuring value-added returns are available for customers and reducing annual maintenance costs. When locomotives and railcars finally reach the end of their usable lives, they can be recycled for other uses through Progress Rail\u2019s scrap management services. We also provide rail take-up and inspection services, including grading of previously used rail that is then recycled, repurposed for other non-rail uses, or relayed into track. In 2022, Progress Rail processed about 70,000 gross tons of material from its scrap management services.\n\n1. Terms and core acceptance criteria apply.\nCat Certified Rebuild\nIn the same spirit as Cat Reman, Cat Certified Rebuild programs increase the lifespan of equipment by providing customers with product updates at a fraction of the cost of buying a new machine, enabling us to extend the life of materials. A complete Cat Certified Rebuild includes more than 350 tests and inspections, automatic replacement or reconditioning of approximately 7,000 parts, and a like-new machine warranty. Trained dealer service professionals perform rebuild work using genuine parts while incorporating the latest engineering updates. Caterpillar provides information, data, training and service tools to help dealers decide which parts to reuse to achieve the expected longevity of rebuilt components. Since 1985, Caterpillar and Cat dealers have rebuilt more than 43,000 machines, powertrains and components.\n\nCaterpillar Energy Solutions X-Change\nThe X-Change program is a parts replacement program for medium and large MWM and Cat branded engines and a great example of circular economy principles. By remanufacturing and selling X-Change parts, engines and gensets, customers benefit from quick and cost-effective overhauls and repair services, maximizing uptime. The replaced parts that reached the initial serviceable lifetime are returned to Caterpillar Energy Solutions where they are cleaned, disassembled, inspected and remanufactured to like-new condition. Technology updates that could potentially reduce emissions and increase efficiency and reliability are included.\n\nCaterpillar Defense\nSupporting U.S. and allied military forces and governmental agencies worldwide, Caterpillar Defense responds to each operation\u2019s individual needs for machines, engines, power generation, services and support, offering solutions that extend the lifecycle of products. Through the U.S. Military Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), Cat dealers give machines a complete second lifecycle at a fraction of new replacement cost. Caterpillar trained and qualified technicians conduct repairs on military bases and customize replacement parts for local needs.\nUNDERSTANDING OUR SCOPE 3 EMISSIONS\n\nCaterpillar is contributing to a reduced-carbon future by investing in new products, technologies and solutions to help our customers meet their climate-related objectives. We have committed that 100% of our new products through 2030 will be more sustainable than the previous generation. Caterpillar will continue to support our diverse range of global customers while executing our strategy for long-term profitable growth.\n\nCaterpillar is represented by durable, reliable and innovative products. Many of our products are built to be rebuilt and our remanufacturing options deliver multiple sustainability benefits. By returning components at the end of their initial serviceable lives to like-new condition, we reduce waste and minimize the need for the raw material, energy and water to produce new parts.\n\nCaterpillar utilizes guidance from the GHG Protocol to calculate Scope 3 GHG emissions. Our Scope 3 emissions are estimated to be more than 95% of the company\u2019s total Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions inventory. Given the company\u2019s large, global customer base covering a diverse set of industries, including construction and mining equipment, off-highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, diesel-electric locomotives, and others, Category 11 \u2014 use of sold products \u2014 is our largest Scope 3 category. The remaining fourteen categories of estimated Scope 3 emissions are either not relevant or are immaterial, representing collectively less than 5% of our total Scope 3 emissions.\n\nThe five-year trend of Caterpillar\u2019s estimated Scope 3 use of sold products emissions illustrates annual emissions at the enterprise level and by primary business segment \u2014 CI, RI and E&T \u2014 as well as the enterprise sales and revenues trend and emissions intensity (MT CO2e divided by enterprise sales and revenues). Most of Caterpillar\u2019s emissions come from products with high-power output, high fuel consumption, high runtime and long product life. In some cases, product life extends decades through service life extension activities including rebuilds, remanufacturing and overhauls.\n\n1. Statement has been assured by ERM CVS, see data assurance statement.\n2. The annual estimates for lifetime use of sold products GHG emissions are calculated from the GHG Protocol expression: \\( \\text{Emissions} = \\text{total lifetime expected uses of product} \\times \\text{number of products sold in reporting period} \\times \\text{fuel consumed per use (kWh)} \\times \\text{emission factor for fuel (kg CO2e/kWh)} \\). The inputs to this equation are specific to construction machines, mining machines, off-highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and diesel-electric locomotives, applied at the product-level to calculate lifetime emissions then aggregated across the full enterprise portfolio. Included in the calculation are GHG emissions from combustion of fuels in our products until the estimated point of final disposal covering rebuild, remanufacturing and overhaul events that extend the service life of the product. Excluded from this calculation are emissions from upstream production of fuel consumed in Caterpillar products, fuel efficiency and emission factor changes through the life of the product, refrigerant emissions, and others considered insignificant to Caterpillar\u2019s enterprise number. The inputs to perform this calculation were integrated from many data sources including but not limited to: Operation and Maintenance Manuals (OMM), product design data, telemetry data, public data sources (U.S. EPA, industry data), and internal engineering, product, marketing, and other subject matter expertise. Our company\u2019s total enterprise Scope 3 use of sold products emissions calculation was verified by a third-party assurance firm (ERM CVS); see the data assurance statement.\nThe impact of macroeconomic conditions on global markets, including the COVID-19 pandemic, had an effect on enterprise emissions due to product mix changes and lower unit volume shipped in 2020 and 2021. Caterpillar\u2019s sales and revenues reflect strong growth from 2020 through 2022, however, emissions remained essentially flat during this period, primarily due to product mix and volume changes across our portfolio. The resulting product mix change is dependent on market and customer trends, especially in certain emissions-intensive industries that changed significantly since 2019. As of the date of this report, Scope 3 use of sold products emissions are expected to increase in 2023 based on customer demand, as well as anticipated shifts in product mix and customer and business trends.\n\nCaterpillar has been a technology leader for nearly a century. We have significant experience developing innovative technologies through consistent R&D investments intended to allow us to maintain technology leadership. Caterpillar remains committed to helping our customers achieve their climate-related objectives and providing long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. Today, for example, all gas turbines offered by Caterpillar can operate on hydrogen blends and some of these turbines can operate on 100% hydrogen. We also offer reciprocating generator sets capable of operating on hydrogen blends and the Cat G3516H gas generator set can be configured to use 100% hydrogen. Our products can use an increasingly wide range of fuels, including renewable fuels, biodiesels, biogas, hydrogen blends and HVO. We also continue to invest in power sources that offer lower emissions without sacrificing performance. To support our customers\u2019 climate-related objectives, Caterpillar offers modern engines and drive trains equipped with the latest technologies that improve fuel efficiency, reduce emissions and translate into cost savings for our customers.\n\nCaterpillar demonstrated our first battery electric 793 large mining truck prototype, operated fully loaded at its rated capacity in a live demonstration with key mining customers in November 2022. Our electric Cat R1700 XE LHD offers 100% battery electric propulsion, producing zero-exhaust emissions for underground mining operations. Our CI segment is expanding its product portfolio and displayed four battery-powered electric machines in October 2022. Our E&T segment has initiated numerous sustainability innovations covering a range of technologies through both organic and inorganic growth and development, including the acquisition of CarbonPoint Solutions, which provides customers access to carbon capture solutions. Caterpillar also offers Cat Energy Storage System, or ESS, a rapidly deployable electric power solution to help customers integrate multiple power sources on a worksite. Cat ESS can provide grid stabilization, transient assist and renewable energy storage. Learn more about Caterpillar\u2019s sustainability-related product innovations and solutions.\n\nNow more than ever, our customers rely on us to provide diverse products, services and technology that help lower GHG emissions, improve efficiency and productivity and deliver energy flexibility. The opportunities presented by the energy transition and our work to help our customers achieve their climate-related objectives led us to add sustainability as a focus area of Caterpillar\u2019s enterprise strategy. We have committed that 100% of our new products through 2030 will be more sustainable than the previous generation. Caterpillar will continue to support our diverse range of global customers while executing our strategy for long-term profitable growth.\nREDUCING CARBON IN OUR OPERATIONS\n\nWe work to reduce GHG emissions in our operations while also minimizing water use and waste generation. Environmentally efficient operations align with our strategy for operational excellence across the enterprise. Guided by our enterprise sustainability goals, we have demonstrated progress and are committed to reaching our targets.\n\nCaterpillar manages hundreds of facilities worldwide and some of these operations, especially our manufacturing sites, are energy intensive. To reduce our energy consumption and our GHG emissions, we are improving energy efficiency, investing in renewable power generation technologies, and considering new solutions. Likewise, we are making other environmental improvements to conserve water by implementing best management practices, notably at facilities located in water-stressed regions, and managing waste through improved recycling and waste minimization activities.\n\nOur enterprise energy management team builds awareness, encourages action and develops improvements in energy efficiency and renewable power generation. These solutions include installing renewable energy technologies, such as photovoltaics (PV) or microgrid installations that combine PV with battery storage to supplement and offset electricity generated with diesel fuel at off-grid locations. One significant contribution to alternative energy consumption is the operation of combined heat and power (CHP) systems to power several manufacturing facilities. The energy management team evaluates opportunities for replication of CHP, PV and microgrids at other locations. We continue to assess new ways to upgrade systems and make facilities more efficient.\n\nAn example of energy innovation can be found at our facility in Lafayette, Indiana, which conducts endurance testing for many Cat products. Testing runs 24 hours a day to provide valuable data insights to improve our products, and the process produces large amounts of energy. Rather than waste this energy, our team at the facility has utilized Cat gensets to harness the energy and use it for supplemental facility power. This change is estimated to have resulted in more than 114,000 metric tons of CO2e emissions avoided over the last five years. In addition to contributing to Caterpillar\u2019s goal to reduce absolute GHG emissions from our operations by 30% from 2018 to 2030, this change has saved the facility more than $8.5 million.\n\nEHS Management System\nWe maintain high standards for environmental, health and safety (EHS) throughout the company. Caterpillar\u2019s EHS Management System, documented in our EHS assurance manual, establishes foundational requirements and best management practices for all workplaces globally, including majority-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned joint ventures. Our facilities assess compliance with our requirements annually, and our EHS assessment team reviews those assessments while conducting more in-depth audits of select facilities each year.\n\nBeyond meeting standard expectations, facilities implement initiatives to enhance safety, decrease energy use and increase productivity. As facilities evaluate potential environmental initiatives, they also consider annual investment required, total anticipated cost savings and average pay-back period. We invite facilities to report emissions reduction activities through internal awards and recognition processes.\n\nOperations\n\nWe have set a science-based Scope 1 and 2 goal to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions from our operations by 30% from 2018 to 2030.\n\n33% reduction in absolute GHG emissions from 2018\n\nImplement water management strategies at 100% of facilities located in water high-risk areas by 2030.\n\n14% facilities achieved the goal of water strategy implementation\n\nReduce landfill intensity by 50% from 2018 to 2030.\n\n36% reduction in landfill intensity from 2018\nReturning People Home Safely\n\nThe safety and well-being of those who work in our facilities and those who work in, on and around our Caterpillar products is of the utmost importance for Caterpillar and one of the hallmarks of our operational excellence.\n\n2022 Highlights\n\n- 17% improvement in recordable injury frequency from 2018\n- Strengthening Caterpillar\u2019s safety-focused culture\n- Supporting customers, dealers and suppliers in their journey toward safety excellence\nEMPLOYEE SAFETY\n\nWe relentlessly strive to ensure our workforce returns home safely every day. We contribute toward a global environment where people can live safe, healthy and productive lives. Safety is forefront in our strategic goals and metrics, with visible commitment and support of leadership. We believe the best way to drive a culture of safety excellence is to create an environment where each person and team is accountable for their own safety and the safety of those around them. Additionally, we nurture a culture of learning in which we continually enhance safety through training and experiences.\n\nCreating Accountability for Everyone\nWe believe safety is both management and employee led. From practical expertise, our employees can create and champion their own safety improvements. We provide every employee, especially newly hired employees, with knowledge to perform their job safely, and leaders regularly receive training on safety compliance and setting an example for a strong safety culture. These actions help us manage risk while creating a culture focused on learning, speaking up and protecting those around us.\n\nWe track enterprise metrics and targets as well as individual business unit goals. Common enterprise targets create structure and accountability, while business unit strategies focus on safety culture to create opportunities for innovation. We drive clear accountability with our EHS management system, that establishes expectations worldwide.\n\nSafety Performance\nWe improved our recordable injury frequency (RIF) rate by 17% from our 2018 base year, although our performance declined by 7% in 2022 from 2021. This performance came on the heels of the pandemic and during a period of rapid growth in our operations that included hiring a significant number of new employees. While we are proud of our progress, we are also deeply saddened that an employee suffered a fatal workplace injury at one of our facilities during the year. This incident highlights that safety must always remain our focus and further strengthens our safety resolve.\n\nSetting the Bar Higher\nAs we pursue our 2030 goal, business unit leaders are engaged in our safety vision. We are strengthening Caterpillar\u2019s safety focused culture, further enhanced by encouraging employee involvement in partnering with leaders to develop safety solutions. Feedback, problem solving dialogue and initiatives foster increased trust and collective ownership. Providing safety learning opportunities for our leaders, safety professionals and employees enhances our efforts. Our goal is challenging but is vitally important as we focus on the safety of our employees.\n\nIMPROVING ERGONOMICS IN INDIA\nAt our Caterpillar India Private Limited facility in Thiruvallur, a team including engineering, safety and management worked alongside our shop floor employees to improve ergonomics throughout the assembly processes. Through a variety of lifting tables and devices, we eliminated high-risk lifting activities. We also developed a governance dashboard to confirm the improvements are sustained. As a result, ergonomic risk decreased, efficiency improved and employees were engaged in enhancing the safety of their area.\n\nMAKING ELECTRIC DRIVES, SAFELY\nIntroducing electric drives to construction machinery brings challenges in fire control, storage and emergency response. To support safe implementation, a cross-functional team from safety, purchasing, quality, logistics, operations and engineering developed a safety manual to guide the manufacturing process. The manual was developed using industry best practices, and the team conducted a pilot to enhance its effectiveness.\n\nGoal\nWe aspire to prevent all injuries and will further our industry-leading safety results by reducing RIF by 50% from 2018 to 2030.\n\n17% improvement in recordable injury frequency from 2018\nCUSTOMER SAFETY\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s commitment to safety goes beyond our employees and facilities. Caterpillar Safety Services provides coaching to customers at every stage in their journey toward safety excellence and change enablement. This team supports our dealers, suppliers and customers using cultural assessment tools, continuous improvement processes, risk management technology and a wealth of industry-focused safety resources.\n\nHuman-Centered Change Management\nCompanies across the globe recognize the need for change management, and integrating it into their operating philosophies. A successful, people-centered change management process results in more engagement of the workforce, increased commitment to the cause, and enhanced performance.\n\nCustomer Safety 2030\n\nGoal\n\nProvide leadership in the safety of people who work in, on and around our products.\n\nSAFETY GOES TO THE FRONT LINE\n\nEven companies with high safety performance must focus on continuous improvement. That is why a global leader in the construction and maintenance of transport infrastructure turned to Caterpillar Safety Services to enhance its safety culture.\n\nWith the help of experts from Caterpillar Safety Services, the organization launched a Journey to Goal Zero as a corporate-wide safety program involving 5,000 employees. The approach was simple: make safety everyone\u2019s responsibility. Through cross-functional rapid improvement workshops, they turned over control of safety to employees in the field, asking them to rebuild safety processes from the ground up based on their frontline knowledge. The other significant change: using positive recognition\u2014rather than focusing on what\u2019s wrong\u2014to measure performance.\n\nOn the other side of the transformation was an empowered team that began to take continuous improvement into their own hands\u2014precisely what needed to happen to move from average to excellent.\nAt Caterpillar, we believe in The Power of Everyone as a source of innovation and competitive advantage. Our people come from across the globe, with diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives united by Our Values in Action.

We continue to invest in power sources that offer lower emissions without sacrificing performance. Our products can use an increasingly wide range of fuels, including renewable fuels, biodiesels, biogas, hydrogen blends and hydrotreated vegetable oil.\n\nCaterpillar is committed to delivering robust electrified products and solutions for our customers. Caterpillar demonstrated our first battery electric 793 large mining truck prototype, operated fully loaded at its rated capacity in a live demonstration with key mining customers in November of 2022. Our electric Cat R1700 XE offers 100% battery electric propulsion, producing zero-exhaust emissions for underground load, haul and dump mining operations. Our CI segment is expanding its product portfolio and displayed four battery-powered electric machines in October 2022. Our E&T segment has initiated numerous sustainability innovations covering a range of technologies through both organic and inorganic growth and development, including the acquisition of CarbonPoint Solutions, which provides customers access to carbon capture solutions. Caterpillar also offers the Cat Energy Storage System, or ESS, a rapidly deployable electric power solution to help customers integrate multiple power sources on a worksite. Cat ESS can provide grid stabilization, transient assist and renewable energy storage. Learn more about Caterpillar\u2019s sustainability-related product innovations and solutions in this report.\n\nIn addition to our investments, we have also taken important actions to further strengthen our sustainability and climate-related efforts which are also responsive to shareholder feedback, including:\n\n- Incorporating ESG performance into the 2022 incentive plan for executives;\n- Releasing our first-ever disclosure of Scope 3 GHG emissions data in 2023;\n- Publishing our first-ever TCFD report in 2023; and\n- Creating an executive leadership position of CSO, reporting directly to the CEO.\n\nCaterpillar sets and achieves meaningful ESG goals and part of our long-standing commitment to sustainability includes reducing our own GHG emissions. We announced our first sustainability goals in 2006 and refined them in 2013 to include a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 (direct and indirect) GHG emissions intensity from 2006 to 2020. We actually achieved a 51% reduction against this goal. As part of our continuous sustainability journey, we disclosed a new goal in 2021 to further reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 30% between 2018 and 2030. We\u2019ve reduced those emissions by 33% since 2018 through improvements in operational efficiency, as well as implementing energy and GHG reduction initiatives at our facilities.\n\nIn 2021, we further emphasized our commitment to reducing product-related emissions by disclosing an additional new goal that 100% of our new products through 2030 will be more sustainable than the previous generation. All of the more than fifty new products introduced in 2022 fulfilled the goal criteria for reduced waste, improved design for rebuild/remanufacturing, improved efficiency and/or lower emissions. The Executive Summary of our Sustainability Report provides more information about Caterpillar\u2019s 2030 goals and progress.\nOur Path Ahead\nCaterpillar recognizes shareholders\u2019 interest in climate change and is increasing our disclosures in this area.\n\nCaterpillar values shareholder feedback. Through regular shareholder engagement, we hear their interest in how Caterpillar is addressing and reporting on Caterpillar\u2019s sustainability journey. We are continuing to demonstrate our commitment to shareholder responsiveness, including delivering important enhancements to climate disclosures in 2023. Caterpillar\u2019s 2022 Sustainability Report includes \u2014 for the first time \u2014 the disclosure of our company\u2019s estimated Scope 3 GHG emissions data and includes our first-ever TCFD report, which summarizes how we govern our strategy to address climate-related risks and opportunities and support customers in the energy transition. Our enhanced reporting also includes a description of how our company incorporated ESG into the 2022 incentive plan for executive officers.\n\nThe 2022 shareholder proposal \u2014 which Caterpillar supported \u2014 requests that our company publish a report disclosing GHG targets aligned with the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius for the full scope of the company\u2019s operational and product-related emissions or rationale for any decision not to set these targets. Caterpillar reports progress annually against its Scope 1 and 2 GHG reduction goal. While we have not publicly reported or established a numeric reduction goal that encompasses Scope 3 GHG emissions, we have committed that 100% of our new products through 2030 will be more sustainable than the previous generation.\n\nDisclosing our Scope 3 GHG data for Category 11 \u2014 use of sold products emissions \u2014 for the first time is an important step on our sustainability journey and demonstrates responsiveness to shareholder feedback. As a global industrial manufacturer with a diverse portfolio of products and solutions, Caterpillar\u2019s business has a global scope, and is subject to variables such as long product life-span and many other data collection, calculation and verification complexities.\n\nRead more about Caterpillar\u2019s five-year trend of estimated Scope 3 GHG emissions, including information about the impact of macroeconomic conditions on product mix changes and unit volumes throughout that period, as well as the influence of customer demand and anticipated shifts in product mix for 2023.\n\nOur company has not set a Scope 3 GHG emissions reduction goal as there are significant factors impacting Scope 3 GHG emissions reductions which Caterpillar cannot control and additional uncertainty continues to impact the path ahead. While our products are helping customers achieve their climate-related objectives, our ability to set specific GHG emissions reduction goals that include activities outside Caterpillar\u2019s operations depends on various factors that are fluid and difficult to predict. These include the range of potential pathways for decarbonization; development, deployment and adoption of new technologies by Caterpillar, our suppliers and our customers; and the impacts of governmental regulations and policies around the world and other factors that could significantly alter customer adoption of new technologies. We have worked diligently to ensure that Caterpillar\u2019s current ESG and GHG emissions goals are meaningful, credible and achievable.\n\nCaterpillar is driven to help enable our customers\u2019 success and doing so will require our company and our customers to address a vast array of complex engineering and technology challenges. We are committed to have lower-carbon products and solutions available for our customers, however, uncertainty exists regarding the rate of customer adoption in the near-, intermediate- and long-term horizons.\n\nCaterpillar has a global customer base, and many of our customers are developing infrastructure to meet the basic needs of society such as shelter, clean water, transportation and reliable energy. For example, customers use our products to develop the infrastructure necessary for clean drinking water in remote areas of Africa. Additionally, current estimates suggest that less than half of the population of sub-Saharan Africa has access to reliable electricity. Without that access, battery-powered machines are not a viable option and diesel-powered machines are required to build critical infrastructure.\n\nCaterpillar has a role to play in serving the diverse range of customer needs globally without the constraints of an emissions reduction imperative that is too narrow or doesn\u2019t account for such differences.\n\nThe ongoing dialogue with our shareholders during our engagement process includes important input and feedback that also influences our path ahead. Throughout the last year, Caterpillar\u2019s shareholders have expressed support for our progress and acknowledged the technical and other challenges and complexities associated with reducing Scope 3 GHG emissions \u2014 especially given our company\u2019s diverse product portfolio serving a wide range of industries and customers \u2014 and they have expressed their desire for Caterpillar to strike the best balance between climate-related progress, together with financial performance and returns that are in the best interest of shareholders.\n\nDespite the longer-term uncertainties, we are committed to continue reducing our own emissions and making progress toward the achievement of our 2030 sustainability goals, including our commitment that 100% of our new products through 2030 will be more sustainable than the previous generation. Caterpillar is also well-positioned to design, engineer and manufacture products; and to develop and deploy technology, services and solutions that will help our customers meet their climate-related objectives while also delivering long-term profitable growth and shareholder value creation.\n\nWhile we recognize the complex challenges and evolving environment on the path ahead, Caterpillar\u2019s long-standing commitment to sustainability will continue to inspire us to help our customers build a better, more sustainable world.\nETHICS & INTEGRITY\n\nWe operate according to Our Values in Action \u2014 Caterpillar\u2019s Code of Conduct. The Code defines our values \u2014 Integrity, Excellence, Teamwork, Commitment and Sustainability \u2014 which represents what we stand for and how we conduct ourselves with our customers, suppliers, communities, and one another.\n\nIt guides our employees, affiliates and board members in living our values each day. Some of the topics that the Code covers include avoiding conflicts of interest, fair competition, anti-bribery, trade compliance, employee performance and development, non-harassment, non-discrimination, personal privacy, supplier expectations and environmental responsibility.\n\nCode of Conduct Training\nAll Caterpillar employees are annually required to complete Code of Conduct training. As part of this training, employees must certify that they have read, understand and agree to comply with the Code of Conduct. Additional compliance training is also provided to employees based on risks identified in their job roles.\n\nEthics & Compliance Helpline\nWe hold ourselves to the highest standard of integrity and ethical behavior. We promote and respect the rule of law and expect our employees and suppliers to do the same. We encourage individuals to report situations in which they have a good-faith belief that any circumstance or action has violated our Code of Conduct, enterprise policy or applicable law. Those who wish to report a concern can do so confidentially and anonymously through resources maintained by our Office of Business Practices. These resources include:\n\n- Online reporting\n- Email reporting at BusinessPractices@cat.com\n- Telephone reporting with toll-free and call-collect dialing options that support reporting in multiple languages and from multiple countries\n\nCaterpillar will not take any action \u2014 or tolerate any reprisal \u2014 against any party for raising an issue in good faith.\n\nLearn more about our governance framework, corporate governance initiatives and board composition:\n\n- Caterpillar Proxy Statement\n- Board Committees\n- Caterpillar Code of Conduct\nPOLITICAL ENGAGEMENT\n\nWe advocate for policies, trade agreements, legislation and regulations that enable us to help our customers.\n\nWhere allowable by law, Caterpillar may make corporate contributions to political organizations or committees to support public policies we believe will promote our business interests. Any corporate political contributions by Caterpillar must be approved by our senior vice president of Global Government & Corporate Affairs. In addition, the board annually reviews the company\u2019s political spending policy and political activities, including corporate political contributions, political contribution activities of the Caterpillar Inc. Political Action Committee (CATPAC), trade association participation, and Caterpillar\u2019s lobbying priorities.1\n\nCATPAC contributions are made only in U.S. federal and state elections. CATPAC is funded through voluntary contributions by eligible individuals. A steering committee comprised of Caterpillar non-officer employees representing a diverse mix of U.S. locations and business units oversees all CATPAC disbursements to ensure they promote the company\u2019s business interests.\n\nCaterpillar also maintains memberships in trade and industry associations that may advocate on behalf of business community segments. We support these organizations as they champion public policies that contribute to the business community\u2019s growth and success.\n\nThe 2022 Caterpillar Lobbying Report highlights how our memberships in U.S. trade and industry associations complement the achievement of our goals and priorities and explains how we manage instances where an association\u2019s positions may not be completely aligned with Caterpillar\u2019s priorities. A climate lobbying section is also included to address our advocacy for policies that help us support our customers during the energy transition.\n\nAdditional information regarding Caterpillar\u2019s corporate contributions, CATPAC contributions and trade association memberships is available on our political engagement website.\n\nOur commitment to transparency and disclosure in our advocacy activities has long been recognized. As part of that commitment, numerous voluntary disclosures and links to filings related to our political engagements are provided on our website. Additionally, we have changed the reporting threshold for U.S. trade and industry association contributions. In previous years, Caterpillar reported membership contributions of $50,000 or more annually. For 2022, we reduced the threshold to $25,000. For 2023, we will report all U.S. trade and industry association memberships biannually. You can find this information and the percentage of 2022 membership dues used for federal lobbying as reported by each organization in the Lobbying Report.\n\nRead the 2022 Lobbying Report\n\n1. Caterpillar\u2019s participation as a member of any trade association comes with the understanding that we may not always agree with all of the positions of the organization or other members.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\nRisk is an inherent part of conducting global business, and managing risk is fundamental to the way we work. Through robust programs, including Enterprise Risk Management, Compliance and Audit, we engage across the enterprise to identify, prioritize and manage risks.\n\nEnterprise Risk Management and our enterprise strategy are linked. To better inform our decision-making, we evaluate risks at the business unit and enterprise levels, considering the likelihood and potential impact of each risk. These evaluations guide our approach for risk management, allow us to understand the challenges these risks bring, and position our business for the opportunities they present.\n\nWe consider risks across many categories, including strategic, operational, financial, compliance and hazard risks. We embed ESG risks into each risk category as part of our commitment to sustainability. We treat these ESG risks with the same priority and rigor as other risks across the business.\n\nIn 2022, Caterpillar conducted its first global climate scenario analysis to identify climate-related risks and opportunities, as summarized in our TCFD report. The results from this analysis are informing the Enterprise Risk Management process for 2023 to further integrate climate-related risks into our evaluations.\n\nAs risk management is fundamental to our culture, there is strong engagement in risk management from the CEO, executives and senior leaders. The company\u2019s officers share accountability for business risks, and the board of directors has oversight of the enterprise process. The board and its committees also oversee risk and have regular updates on topics that are identified through the risk management process. Outputs from risk management drive strategic initiatives and disclosures.\n\nOur risk management culture enables us to critically evaluate risks to our business and identify opportunities to create value for our employees, customers and shareholders. Our commitment to sustainability is reflected in our risk management practices as we strive to build a better, more sustainable world.\nCaterpillar is committed to responsibly sourcing the raw materials used to build our products.\n\nOur supply base includes approximately 27,000 suppliers around the world providing raw materials and manufactured components across broad categories and technologies for aftermarket and production parts. These purchases include a variety of unformed steel products, cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities; steel and iron castings and forgings, machined to final specification; and finished components, made to Caterpillar or supplier-developed specifications. We also help keep those materials in circulation for as long as possible.\n\nWe maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities\u2019 production needs while building long-term supplier relationships. We pursue suppliers and business allies who demonstrate strong values and commit to the ethical principles outlined in the Caterpillar Supplier Code of Conduct. We also expect suppliers to comply with the sound business practices we embrace, follow the law and conduct activities in a manner that respects human rights.\n\nSupplier Diversity\nSupplier diversity continues to be a focus for our strategic procurement team. With a strong base of diverse suppliers already in place, we are investing in tools that will help identify diverse suppliers for new business opportunities. This is key to delivering on our commitment to foster and increase business purchases with diverse suppliers.\n\nResponsible Mineral Sourcing\nMany considerations go into the responsible sourcing of minerals used in our products. Tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold (3TG), collectively known as \u2018conflict minerals,\u2019 have been associated with human rights violations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. Our Conflict Minerals Position Statement contains clear expectations for our suppliers regarding their sourcing of these materials. We have established a process that identifies areas of risk on an ongoing basis, and corrective action plans to mitigate or remediate such risks relating to conflict minerals. A supplier\u2019s failure to take corrective actions when required may lead to additional actions, up to and including the termination of our business relationship.\n\nCaterpillar supports the Responsible Minerals Initiative to help influence smelters\u2019 engagement to support supply chain transparency and leverage industry collaboration toward greater business intelligence. Year after year, we strive for an increased supplier response rate, emphasizing 3TG priority suppliers. Caterpillar also publicly discloses the results of our Reasonable Country of Origin process and any necessary due diligence in our Conflict Minerals Report we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which discloses metrics and results of inquiries we execute within our first-tier suppliers. In these reports, we describe our due diligence efforts, including risk mitigation and process improvements we expect to implement in the following year.\n\nRead:\nSupplier Code of Conduct\nConflict Minerals Position Statement\nHUMAN RIGHTS\n\nIn accordance with Our Values in Action, Caterpillar is committed to respecting internationally recognized human rights principles throughout our global operations.\n\nWe Support Individual and Collective Rights Across the Globe.\n\n- Our Code of Conduct, Human Rights Policy, Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement and Supplier Code of Conduct represent our commitment that we will not condone and will strive to eliminate all forms of forced labor, child labor, human trafficking and discrimination in the workplace.\n- We remain committed to establishing safe and healthy working conditions.\n- We value diversity as a foundational key to the success of our business strategy and seek to compensate our employees fairly and competitively where they work.\n- We respect the principles of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining.\n- We have compassion for all persons affected by conflict wherever it occurs, and we expect our directors, officers, employees, business partners and suppliers, including in conflict-affected areas, to comply with all applicable laws and conduct activities in a manner that respects human rights. This also applies to our subsidiaries and majority-owned joint ventures.\n\nRead our Human Rights Policy\nBEYOND CATERPILLAR: INVESTING IN COMMUNITIES\n\nIn 2022, Caterpillar\u2019s philanthropic organization, the Caterpillar Foundation, celebrated seven decades of helping build resilient communities. The Foundation\u2019s global work in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education, workforce readiness, sustainable natural infrastructure, access to basic services, disaster relief, employee volunteerism and matching gifts, have helped communities around the world achieve sustainable progress. Since its founding, the Caterpillar Foundation has invested nearly $900 million to help improve the lives of people around the world.\n\nAs a company, Caterpillar works alongside its dealers and customers to build the societal infrastructure necessary for a better, more sustainable world. The Foundation focuses on the complementary human, natural and basic services infrastructure needed for individuals to thrive and communities to be resilient. Our combined success contributes to the stability of regions around the world. The Foundation has four key areas of focus:\n\n- **Empowering the workforce of the 21st century:** Through skills development and STEM, we help equip individuals with the skills required for tomorrow\u2019s workforce. Skills-based education leads to better jobs and better jobs lead to better futures.\n\n- **Building resilient communities to address critical environmental challenges:** The Foundation supports natural infrastructure development and access to basic services, such as water resource management and access to energy.\n\n- **Focusing on diversity and inclusion:** We bridge community gaps by supporting underrepresented populations and those with the greatest needs.\n\n- **Giving back in our communities:** Caterpillar\u2019s global team helps build a better, more sustainable world using their passion, time and talent to give back, maximizing impact through the Foundation\u2019s disaster and matching gifts programs, United Way and volunteer efforts.\n\nCreating the Workforce of the 21st Century\n\nUnderstanding the importance of equipping individuals and communities with the skills, resources and services they need to thrive in our changing world, the Foundation invested about $16M million in 25 countries to support workforce readiness and STEM. An example is the Foundation\u2019s partnership with Malaika, a nonprofit grassroots organization that empowers Congolese girls and their communities through education and health programs. Together, we have built a Technical and Education Training Center that provides mechanical and electrical training, focusing on closing community skills gaps and providing new job opportunities in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Malaika\u2019s community-driven model has been integral since its founding in 2013 and has led to transformative change. The students have 1,200 contact hours in group classes and cover topics such as safety, machine mechanics, diesel mechanics, gasoline engine management, auto electronics, brake systems, suspension and steering, and manual driving skills.\n\nEstablishing Natural Infrastructure\n\nIn 2022, the Foundation had nearly 70 active sustainable infrastructure programs, committing over $13 million across 30 countries to restore natural ecosystems to withstand natural disasters and environmental challenges. Together with the Foundation\u2019s partners, these programs seek to remove, sequester or capture carbon by restoring land. One such program is Blue Forest Conservation\u2019s Forest Resilience Bond, which bridges the finance gap for much-needed forest restoration across the western U.S. and supports natural infrastructure projects on public land. In the Sierra and Yuba counties in California, the program impacted approximately 81,000 residents, creating more than 200 jobs in the local community and providing hydroelectric power, drinking water, and flood control for over 30,000 people.\n\nAlongside our partners, the Caterpillar Foundation participated in many thought leadership events, including the 2022 United Nations General Assembly/Climate Week in New York.\nThe Foundation is partnering with Conservation International and others to develop a \u201cGreen-Gray Cost-Benefit Analysis Tool\u201d to compare green and gray alternatives for infrastructure and coastal resilience projects in Mexico and the North Brazil Shelf. \u201cGreen\u201d infrastructure (wetlands and forests), alongside traditional \u201cgray\u201d infrastructure (seawalls or dams) not only provide environmental and biodiversity benefits, but can also extend the life of coastal infrastructure including roads, bridges, and highways. By better understanding the benefits of blending \u201cgreen\u201d conservation with \u201cgray\u201d engineering techniques, communities can enjoy the benefits of both solutions.\n\nDisaster Relief\nThe Caterpillar Foundation is a member of the American Red Cross Annual Disaster Giving Program. The Foundation\u2019s $1 million annual global investment helps provide a funding base, allowing the Red Cross to provide immediate relief to those impacted by disasters big and small. This model ensures that the Red Cross has funds to prepare for disasters before they occur.\n\nThe Foundation has donated more than $1 million to support both urgent and long-term needs of the Ukraine humanitarian crisis. This donation supports organizations that include the American Red Cross in support of the global Red Cross network response to the Ukraine humanitarian crisis, Project HOPE and the Center for Disaster Philanthropy. Caterpillar team members eager to help in a time of crisis, along with a Foundation match, contributed another more than $1 million, making an even greater impact. The Foundation\u2019s disaster preparedness support also enabled partner organizations to respond to disasters such as in the Mayfield, Kentucky, area when tornadoes ripped through the center of the U.S.; catastrophic flooding in several European and African countries, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and China; Western U.S. wildfires; Hurricane Fiona that impacted Puerto Rico; and an earthquake in Afghanistan.\n\nDiversity & Inclusion\nCommunities are strongest when there is equality for all. In 2022, Foundation investments targeted support for several underserved populations. Through partnership with DigDeep, families within the Navajo Nation will gain access to water \u2014 eliminating hours spent each week hauling water from streams, wells and grocery stores. Nomi Network works to create a brighter future for women and girls vulnerable to human trafficking in Dallas, Texas, and India by building economic sustainability through workforce development programs. The Aspen Young Leaders Fellowship supports youth of color from the lowest quartile of the socio-economic ladder to pursue STEM degrees by proactively supporting individuals with financial, academic and personal factors that prevent them from achieving success.\n\nCaterpillar Foundation and The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs)\n\nThe Caterpillar Foundation\u2019s investments align with several of the UN SDGs. The Caterpillar Foundation works to build resilient communities in the places where we live and work and where there is need.\nIn addition to the 2022 Sustainability Report, we are also pleased to publish our inaugural TCFD Report.\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\nThe reporting period is the 2022 calendar year, which is also Caterpillar\u2019s fiscal year. Caterpillar is headquartered in Irving, Texas.\n\nThis report has been prepared in accordance with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), as well as with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative Universal Standards. SASB publishes sector-specific reporting standards based on expert input, and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) publishes reporting standards based on company-conducted materiality assessments, both designed to help businesses to identify the sustainability issues of highest importance to investors and most relevant in their industry. In addition, we have published our inaugural TCFD Report, which aligns with the 11 recommended disclosures of the TCFD and summarizes how we govern our strategy to address climate-related risks and opportunities and support customers in the energy transition. Our sustainability efforts and approach is consistent with the UN SDGs.\n\nGiven the breadth of our products, services and solutions, our advocacy on behalf of policies that enable sustainable development and the Caterpillar Foundation\u2019s effort to build resilient communities, Caterpillar and our customers are helping build a more sustainable future. The contents of this report represent the products and operations of Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries where we have a controlling financial interest.

Women In Leadership data reflects all women with responsibilities for managing employees as part of their job scope. Data excludes Progress Rail.\n2. Data prior to 2022 has been revised for improved accuracy.\n3. Renewable energy percent includes purchased and on-site generated renewable energy, as well as calculating the percentage of renewable energy from grid-purchased electricity using data obtained from the International Energy Agency.\n4. Renewable Energy: Caterpillar defines renewable energy as energy resources that are naturally replenishing over a short period of time and virtually inexhaustible. Power generation examples include wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, tidal, wave, biomass and biogas from anaerobic digestion.\n5. Location-based Scope 2 GHG emissions are provided in accordance with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 guidance (2015). Our market-based Scope 2 emissions are calculated using the Scope 2 Quality Criteria. The following instruments were used in calculating our market-based Scope 2 emissions: Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin, energy contracts, supplier-specific emission rates, and, for the remainder of our facilities, grid average emission factors from USEPA\u2019s eGRID (2020) and the International Energy Agency\u2019s data (2019). For 2022 calculations, Caterpillar did not use residual mix factors.\n6. GHG emissions intensity is based on our combined Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect, market-based) GHG emissions. Likewise, total absolute GHG emissions are a sum of Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market-based) emissions.\n7. Results may not add to total due to rounding.\n8. The annual estimates for lifetime use of sold products GHG emissions are calculated from the GHG Protocol expression: \\( \\sum (\\text{total lifetime expected uses of product} \\times \\text{number of products sold in reporting period} \\times \\text{fuel consumed per use (kWh)} \\times \\text{emission factor for fuel (kg CO2e/kWh)}) \\). The inputs to this equation are specific to construction machines, mining machines, off-highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and diesel-electric locomotives, applied at the product-level to calculate lifetime emissions then aggregated across the full enterprise portfolio. Included in the calculation are GHG emissions from combustion of fuels in our products until the estimated point of final disposal covering rebuild, remanufacturing, and overhaul events that extend the service life of the product. Excluded from this calculation are emissions from upstream production of fuel consumed in Caterpillar products, fuel efficiency and emission factor changes through the life of the product, refrigerant emissions, and others considered insignificant to Caterpillar\u2019s enterprise number. The inputs to perform this calculation were integrated from many data sources including but not limited to: Operation and Maintenance Manuals (OMM), product design data, telemetry data, public data sources (U.S. EPA, industry data), and internal engineering, product, marketing, and other subject matter expertise. Our company\u2019s total enterprise Scope 3 use of sold products emissions calculation was verified by a third-party assurance firm (ERM CVS); please see the assurance statement.\n9.
