As a core part of that mission, we\u2019re committed to helping people make more meaningful choices for their purchases and businesses. From our start more than 25 years ago, we\u2019ve championed recommerce, promoting a healthier planet and economy through the selling and buying of pre-loved goods on our marketplace. At the same time, we\u2019re making key strides toward our own climate goals \u2014 and weaving sustainability throughout our company culture and giving efforts.\n\nI\u2019m proud of all the ways our team innovates on behalf of our sellers and buyers.

The update included adjusting the matrix\u2019s axes to incorporate impact outwards on the environment and society (y-axis) and impact inwards on our business and financial success (x-axis), incorporating additional data sources like external frameworks, ESG ratings, consumer insights and peer benchmarking. Input for this update involved a much larger variety of stakeholders, including eBay employees, external subject matter experts, relevant NGOs and more. The new matrix highlights key issues according to four main themes: economic opportunity, sustainable commerce, culture and workforce and trusted marketplace.
