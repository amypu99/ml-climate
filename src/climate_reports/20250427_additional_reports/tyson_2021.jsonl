More than ever, we operate as part of a global food system, connected across borders not only by markets but also by global events and trends. We are working to help create a food system that is more sustainable and equitable for current and future generations. By improving connectivity and delivering the highest-quality protein possible, we can contribute solutions to the most pressing global challenges such as climate change, population growth, social justice and food insecurity, which our teams are working hard to address.\n\nIn 2021, we renewed our focus on three essential pillars of success\u2014reimagining our people and community impact, driving product responsibility, and working toward sustaining natural resources and the planet\u2014and are continuing that work in 2022 to set new targets and commitments. Our efforts this year will help us continue our mission to feed people responsibly and expand the good that food can do.\n\nAbout this Report\nOur 2021 Sustainability Report highlights key environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategy, performance and achievements, providing an update on our progress during FY2021 and some of FY2022. The 2021 fiscal year began Oct. 4, 2020, and extended to Oct. 2, 2021. In preparing this report, we referenced the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards (2016) and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards. This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI: Core option. Additional information on Tyson Foods\u2019 policies, programs and commitments that support sustainability initiatives is available at tysonsustainability.com.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n| 1 | Company and Strategy |\n|---|----------------------|\n| 8 | Reimagining Our People and Community Impact |\n| 16 | Driving Product Responsibility from Farm to Table |\n| 23 | Working Toward Sustaining Natural Resources and Achieving Net Zero |\nA Message from Our CEO\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s largest global food companies and a recognized leader in protein, Tyson Foods employs more than 137,000 people, operates 268 production facilities and markets products in 140 countries. As a result, we have a big impact on\u2014and responsibility to\u2014the world.\n\nWe are constantly striving for excellence and evolving to better meet the increasing demand for protein in responsible and sustainable ways. I\u2019m proud of the progress we\u2019ve made over the past year, including our work to embed ESG issues in our business strategy and oversight processes, through our Board of Directors and Enterprise Leadership Team (ELT); and to refresh our ESG strategy, the Formula to Feed the Future.\n\nAs an organization, we continually innovate to make the world a better place for team members, our communities and our customers. I\u2019m awed by the considerable progress we\u2019ve made across the organization.\n\nReimagining Our People and Community Impact\n\nWe published our first Global Human Rights Policy addressing issues that include child and forced labor, human trafficking, nondiscrimination, health, safety and environment. Putting our team members first, in 2021, Tyson became the largest food company in the country to announce a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for all active U.S. team members.\n\nIn addition, we invested more than $500 million in wage increases and team member bonuses in 2021. In 2021, Tyson awarded nearly $400,000 to the Wesley Community Center and Maverick Boys and Girls Club of Amarillo to refurbish their facilities to accommodate the children of Tyson team members employed at the company\u2019s Amarillo beef plant. In April 2022, Tyson broke ground on a new childcare facility at our Humboldt, Tennessee, poultry processing plant. The facility is expected to be operational in 2023.\n\nDriving Product Responsibility from Farm to Table\n\nWe\u2019ve reached over $100 million invested to support startup companies working to develop sustainable food solutions through Tyson Ventures, and we launched new plant-based protein products and expanded our portfolio into Asia Pacific markets.\n\nWorking Toward Sustaining Natural Resources and Achieving Net Zero\n\nWe announced our ambition to reach net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 and achieved Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) certifications and zero waste to landfill (ZWTL) validations at several of our plant locations.\n\nThrough this report, we also renew our ongoing commitment to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and its Ten Principles with respect to human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. We joined the UNGC in 2018 and support its mission to mobilize a global movement of sustainable companies and stakeholders to create the world we want.\n\nThanks to the incredible effort and dedication of our team members, growers, farmers and ranchers, strategic partners and suppliers, we continue to achieve improved results toward our sustainability goals. We look forward to our continued work together and are as committed as ever to tackle the critical societal and environmental challenges we face as we strive to feed a growing world responsibly.\n\nDonnie King\nPresident & CEO,\nTyson Foods\nAbout Tyson Foods\n\nTyson Foods is one of the world\u2019s largest food companies and a recognized leader in protein.

We hold ourselves accountable for the future of our business by advancing thinking on important issues and trends, such as climate change; finite natural resources; demographic shifts; the wellbeing of workers, communities and the animals entrusted to our care; and rising needs and expectations for nutritious, affordable protein. As the world population grows and demand for protein expands outside of the U.S., we will continue to grow our business in a way that is responsible and meets consumers\u2019 needs.\n\nWe remain committed to responsible ESG governance and have expanded our accountability practices in 2021. For example, we formally delegated comprehensive ESG oversight to the Board of Directors\u2019 Governance and Nominating Committee\u2014an update now reflected in the committee\u2019s charter. The committee takes an active role in our company\u2019s ESG strategy and public reporting. In the coming months, they will help to further establish Tyson as a leader in delivering responsible and innovative protein.\n\nWe continue to ensure robust oversight in all areas of Board responsibility. Current committees and ESG oversight areas include:\n\n- Audit Committee\n- Compensation and Leadership Development Committee\n- Executive Committee\n- Governance and Nominating Committee (Risk Committee)\n- Strategy and Acquisitions Committee\n\nESG Governance\n\nWith oversight from our Board, our president and chief executive officer leads Tyson\u2019s ESG approach. Our chief sustainability officer (CSO) reports to our CEO and shares regular progress updates of the Board of Directors with the Governance and Nominating Committee. Our CSO is supported by a team of professionals who facilitate progress toward our goals, including actions to manage or mitigate risks and to pursue continuous improvement opportunities related to our people and communities, products, animal welfare and natural resources. Collectively, our CEO and CSO work with fellow members of Tyson\u2019s ELT to oversee the development and implementation of Tyson\u2019s ESG strategy, including communications, disclosures and reporting.\n\nFor more information about our Board of Directors and corporate governance practices, visit Investor Relations at tysonfoods.com or refer to our FY2021 Proxy Statement.\nA Message from Our CSO\n\n2021 was an important year for the development of Tyson Foods\u2019 sustainability strategy, and one which I know we\u2019ll look back on as a milestone in achieving our ambition of being the most sustainable and transparent food company in the world.\n\nNow, more than ever, we have a critical role to play when it comes to offering affordable, accessible and nutritious protein to our neighbors around the world. We are committed to operating with excellence and doing our part to ensure we\u2019re creating a food system that is sustainable and equitable for generations to come.\n\nOur world continues to evolve and, because of that, we made the thoughtful approach to reevaluate our ESG strategy and renew our key focus areas to better reflect our journey to creating a more sustainable food system. At the end of 2021, we began mapping and prioritizing the ESG issues that are of substantial interest to our business and our stakeholders. The three refreshed pillars of our ESG strategy, the Formula to Feed the Future, encompass these critical opportunities.\n\n- Reimagining Our People and Community Impact\n- Driving Product Responsibility from Farm to Table\n- Working Toward Sustaining Natural Resources and Achieving Net Zero\n\nAs we develop our 2030 sustainability plan, we continue to make progress against our existing commitments and communicate our performance both internally and externally. This report includes updates on key programs and initiatives, and we provide further transparency on our practices, policies and positions. We\u2019ve also refreshed and expanded our ESG Data Center to meet the reporting requirements of customers, investors and other key stakeholders and continue to align our reporting with consideration of key standards, including SASB and GRI.\n\nThank you to our more than 137,000 talented Tyson Foods team members who work hard every day to produce and deliver high-quality protein to millions of people around the world. And thank you to our customers, suppliers and other key partners. We truly recognize the importance of collaboration, and we\u2019re excited to continue on our journey to sustainably feed the world, together.\n\nJohn R. Tyson\nEVP Strategy & Chief Sustainability Officer, Tyson Foods\n\nESG Rankings and Awards\n\n#1 Fortune Magazine Most Admired Companies\nFood Production category\n\n30 Best Companies to Work for 2022\nLatino Leaders Magazine\n\nA+ Rating\nBetter Business Bureau\nWhat Matters to Tyson Foods\n\nWe are delivering on the expectations of our stakeholders to invest in the sustainability of Tyson Foods for the long term.\n\nTo better understand the ESG priorities of our stakeholders, Tyson began an extensive materiality assessment in 2021. We engaged our internal and external stakeholders, including hourly and salaried workers, senior leadership, investors, customers, suppliers, NGOs, government agencies and other organizations. Our updated materiality matrix reflects our commitment to our stakeholders and understanding of a wide variety of ESG issues. These issues are closely connected with one another, and we are working to establish appropriate key performance indicators and goals related to each critical issue area.\n\nDuring the materiality assessment, three issues surfaced that are of primary importance to Tyson and our stakeholders. These issues include the health and welfare of the animals, the wellbeing and talent of our team members and the stewardship of natural resources. Each of these areas is a critical component of Tyson\u2019s investment and innovation for the future. To succeed in a global marketplace, we must be the employer and protein source of choice.\n\nTyson\u2019s ESG Materiality Assessment:\n\n1. **Engage with Our Stakeholders:** We mapped stakeholders across several core groups: internal, customers, consumers, investors, suppliers, government, industry groups, academics and strategic partners.\n\n2. **Identify Issues:** We identified 20 potentially material ESG issues with inputs from industry peers, ratings and standards organizations, a media scan and our own enterprise risk management.\n\n3. **Prioritize Issues:** We conducted 36 interviews and collected more than 7,500 survey responses across 10 stakeholder groups to understand their priority issue areas among the 20 material topics identified.\n\n4. **Build and Validate Our Materiality Matrix:** We combined inputs from the surveys and interviews of our internal and external stakeholders to develop a materiality matrix, which illustrates each issue\u2019s importance to both Tyson and our stakeholders. We used the matrix to identify issues that our internal working groups, which are dedicated to setting ambitious goals and actions, will address in the coming year.\n\n---\n\n(1) In the context of our ESG materiality assessment, material issues are defined as those issues at Tyson that have the potential for positive and negative repercussions but for which no formal monetary threshold has been applied or determined.\nThe Formula to Feed the Future\n\nWe are renewing our strategic commitment and aspirations for the future.\n\nAt Tyson Foods, we are constantly striving for excellence and evolving to better meet the increasing demand for protein in responsible and sustainable ways. We are refreshing our ESG strategy, the Formula to Feed the Future, introduced in our 2020 report, to better encapsulate our bold commitment to our people, communities, animals and customers.\n\nBased on the insight we gained through deep engagement with our stakeholders during our most recent materiality assessment, we\u2019ve begun the process to refresh our ESG strategy. We\u2019re assessing how we can develop a holistic, enterprisewide 2030 plan that builds from our existing 2030 goals and supports our ambition to deliver high-quality, sustainable and nutritious protein to consumers for generations to come.\n\nTo execute this ambitious strategy, we established several working groups tasked with developing 2030 goals, targets, key performance indicators (KPIs), implementation roadmaps and resourcing plans. The working groups are composed of leaders from across functional and business units.\n\nGroup members and responsibilities include:\n\n- **Executive sponsor**: Responsible for oversight and guidance for targets, roadmaps and resourcing.\n- **Working group leader**: Drives goal setting, roadmap development and resource planning.\n- **Working group members**: Represent business units and functions; create goals, supporting targets and KPIs; develop roadmaps and resourcing plans.\n- **Working group coordinator**: Provides administrative support and keeps the process on track.\n\nWe\u2019ve worked hard to rally around the issues and stakeholders that matter most and saw significant achievements in all ESG areas. We worked tirelessly on aligning our approach and are paving the way for future growth and impact.\n\nLearn more our stakeholder engagement strategy.\n\n---\n\n**Reimagining Our People & Community Impact**\n\nCreate work environments that enable workers to succeed while supporting the growth of our communities.\n\n- Talent Attraction & Development\n- Diversity, Equity & Inclusion\n- Human Rights & Labor Relations\n- Health, Safety & Wellbeing\n- Community Investment\n\n**Driving Product Responsibility from Farm to Table**\n\nDeliver value to consumers with high-quality, sustainable, nutritious protein through leading portfolio.\n\n- Nutrition, Access & Affordability\n- Product Quality & Safety\n- Product Innovation\n- Sustainable Packaging\n- Animal Health & Welfare\n\n**Working Toward Sustaining Natural Resources & Achieving Net Zero**\n\nDrive practices in own operations and supply chains to more sustainably produce protein for a growing population within planetary boundaries.\n\n- Climate Action\n- Land Stewardship\n- Water Stewardship\n- Waste Reduction\n\nAll of which is underpinned by a strong foundation of corporate governance, business ethics, supply chain management, and data privacy and cybersecurity.\nReimagining Our People and Community Impact\n\nTyson Foods\u2019 formula to feed the future starts with our people\u2014more than 137,000 team members working at 268 facilities, offices, hatcheries and distribution centers globally.\n\nMost of our team members work at facilities and processing plants throughout the U.S., yet they represent many countries across the world. We empower them by creating a culture based on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and by providing tools for long-term professional growth. To attract and retain top talent, we offer a range of family and wellness-focused benefits programs, including expanded access to health care and opportunities for team members to develop their work and life skills. In 2021, Tyson awarded nearly $400,000 to the Wesley Community Center and Maverick Boys and Girls Club of Amarillo to refurbish their facilities to accommodate the children of Tyson team members employed at the company\u2019s Amarillo beef plant. In April 2022, Tyson broke ground on a new childcare facility at our Humboldt, Tennessee, poultry processing plant. The facility is expected to be operational in 2023. Beyond our facilities, we partner with thousands of independent local farmers and ranchers and support community initiatives for hunger relief. By putting people first, we continue to grow Tyson\u2019s business while creating more resources for our team members and communities to thrive.\nHow We Supported People and Communities\n\nInvested $500 million+ in wage increases and bonuses to our hourly workforce\n\nCommitted $1 million in FY2022, through the Tyson Immigration Partnership, to help immigrant employees from 160 countries acquire U.S. citizenship\n\nCelebrated five years of Miles that Matter, which donates a pound of protein for every mile of team member or family member exercise, resulting in 50 chapters and 1 million lbs of food\n\nDonated 16 M+ lbs of protein\u2014valued at $36 million and equivalent to 64 million meals\u2014to support food banks, pantries and hunger relief organizations\n\nAchieved a year-on-year reduction in organizationwide work-related injuries and illnesses\n\nInvested $3.9 million in childcare programs at our plants in Amarillo, Texas, and Humboldt, Tennessee\n\nExpanded Upward Academy in FY2022 to provide all U.S. team members with free education through a four-year, $60 million investment\n\nVaccinated nearly 100% of our U.S. workforce achieving 96% vaccinations ahead of our Nov. 1 deadline\n\nAchieved 28% women in management positions\n\nHosted two enterprisewide engagement surveys in December 2020 and June 2021 with high scores of 81 and 78\nTalent Attraction and Development\n\nTyson Foods strives to be the most sought-after place to work in the food industry. That\u2019s why we have invested in innovative programs to build and support our diverse teams for years. Competitive pay and benefits differentiates us from other employers while helping team members maintain a higher quality of life. Because many of our plants are in areas with limited labor pools, we focus on developing and promoting internal talent. In 2021, Tyson achieved 66,382 new hires and filled 14% of open positions with internal candidates.\n\nWe support team members\u2019 growth by providing opportunities for education and life-skill development, including through the Tyson Immigration Partnership (TIP), which helps immigrant employees acquire U.S. citizenship. In 2022, Tyson committed more than $1 million through TIP to support team members from more than 160 countries who collectively speak more than 50 languages. The program now serves 40 Tyson locations in 14 states. We also partnered with organizations such as Tent Partnership for Refugees (Tent), Manpower and Hiring our Heroes to create job opportunities for hundreds of refugees. As an example, between Nov. 1, 2021 and May 26, 2022, Tyson hired over 550 refugees.\n\nSupporting Education and Career Development\n\nIn 2021, Tyson marked the fifth anniversary of our Upward Academy adult education program, which now spans 46 Tyson locations. The program helps team members develop important life skills through classes on English as a Second Language, high school equivalency, U.S. citizenship and financial and digital literacy. To complement Upward Academy, we piloted a new in-plant, career development program called Upward Pathways. The program, in partnership with adult education providers and community colleges, provides front-line team members with job skills training and workforce certifications at no cost.\n\nIn 2022, we expanded Upward Academy to provide free education for all U.S. team members. Through our partnership with Guild and a four-year, $60 million investment, U.S. team members can now earn free master\u2019s, bachelor\u2019s and associate\u2019s degrees; career certificates; and literacy and technology fundamentals. Our investment covers 100% of all tuition, books and fees and will include access to more than 175 programs from over 35 top universities and learning providers.\n\nInvesting in Team Members\u2019 Economic and Family Needs\n\nWorking through the COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging for workers on Tyson\u2019s front lines, yet our team members have persevered. To support them, we invested more than $500 million in wage increases and bonuses in 2021, including about $50 million in one-time thank-you bonuses delivered at the end of the year. Additionally, we increased front-line workers\u2019 average total compensation. With average hourly pay of more than $18, plus the value of medical, dental and vision insurance, vacation and other benefits, we have increased their average total compensation to more than $24 per hour. That equates to an annual value of over $50,000 before including overtime, an option many team members choose, or other incentives.\n\nAlso in 2021, we announced two new childcare initiatives for which Tyson will subsidize team members\u2019 costs. These initiatives include subsidized childcare for second-shift workers at our beef plant in Amarillo, Texas, and Tyson Tykes\u2014a $3.5 million on-site childcare and learning facility that we\u2019re building at our poultry processing plant in Humboldt, Tennessee.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nThe Difference That Strengthens: One of Tyson Foods\u2019 strengths is our highly diverse workforce, which can represent up to 50 countries and speak more than 11 different languages at a single U.S. plant.\n\nAt Tyson Foods, Inc., we strongly believe that DEI is that difference that strengthens our ability to achieve our stated vision and mission in a way that increases shareholders\u2019 value. By reflecting the diversity of the communities that we serve, we\u2019re able to create more innovative products and build deeper relationships with customers, consumers and suppliers, ultimately giving Tyson a marketplace advantage. To build on this strength, we engage military, LGBTQ, civil rights, educational and other organizations in our recruiting efforts and use our supplier diversity program to support minority-owned businesses and farms. Tyson\u2019s Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer, Paul Davis, leads these efforts, with support from senior leadership, to include our business units and Human Resources leaders.\n\nTyson is committed to creating a culture of safety, belonging and empowerment for all, which drives us to speak out against incidents of racism and hate. In 2021, we stood proudly with our Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities while collaborating with plant managers and community liaisons to deliver seven AAPI-focused grants across five states. The grants provided services, education and opportunities for organizations including the Ethnic Minorities of Burma Advocacy and Resource Center and the Arkansas Coalition of Marshallese, both of which have worked with our team members for years.\n\nWe also used our platforms to celebrate team member diversity, honoring moments such as Black History Month, Diwali, Hispanic Heritage Month, National Coming Out Day, Pacific Islander Heritage Month, Veteran\u2019s Day and Women\u2019s History Month. Our Business Resource Groups (BRGs) are an integral part of our DEI strategy. These groups not only allow our company to celebrate their unique culture with our team members, but also to have a collective voice in how we do business. Currently we have nine active BRGs, all of which have executive-level sponsors and/or champions.\n\nFinally, we continued to expand Tyson\u2019s Mentoring Circles, which connect a diverse group of team members and leaders. Our Women\u2019s BRG began the circles in 2018 to enable cross-organization development and networking opportunities. The Women\u2019s BRG continued to manage the program through 2021, before migrating it to Talent and Culture in 2022. This enabled an even broader group of team members to engage with the Circles, which have grown from nine mentors and 86 mentees in 2018 to 120 mentors and 625 mentees in 2022.\n\nIn early 2022, we hosted the first Tyson Foods Black College World Series (BCWS) at Riverwalk Stadium in Montgomery, Alabama. BCWS hosted its inaugural series in 2021, and Tyson will serve as the title sponsor from 2022 to 2024.\nHuman Rights and Labor\n\nEnsuring that people are treated with dignity and respect is essential to doing good business.\n\nAcross our operations, Tyson Foods works hard to uphold the highest ethical standards and practices in all we do. Our Supplier Code of Conduct describes the principles and standards we expect supply partners to adhere to. For team members, Tyson\u2019s Core Values, Code of Conduct, Team Behaviors and Team Member Promise guide our behaviors. We reinforce these behaviors through internal communication and annual compliance training. We also reinforce them through our Social Compliance Auditing program, which, in 2021, audited 50 Tyson facilities. To support accountability and transparency, Tyson maintains a 24-hour, multilanguage Ethics Help Line where team members can voice ethics questions, complaints or concerns. Team members can also use the Ethics Help Line\u2019s web reporting page, TellTysonFirst, to ask questions about policies or request an ethics opinion. This aids in clarification on ethics and compliance issues for team members and helps us to address common questions. In 2021, the helpline received 3,863 reports. Learn more about the hotline and other ethics and compliance programs on our website.\n\nTyson published our first Global Human Rights Policy in 2021\u2014which speaks to issues that include child and forced labor; human trafficking; nondiscrimination; wage and hour practices; collective bargaining; health, safety and environment; and corporate social responsibility\u2014and signed on to the Department of Transportation\u2019s Leaders Against Human Trafficking Pledge. One team member used Tyson\u2019s Giving Together match program to raise thousands of dollars for the Dressember Foundation, a community of international advocates who use fashion to help end human trafficking.\n\nIn addition to Tyson\u2019s internal guidelines, we align with policies and practices set forth by the UN\u2019s Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization\u2019s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Our Supplier Code of Conduct describes our human rights expectations of suppliers and is linked in purchase order terms and conditions and applicable contracts.\nEmployee Health, Safety and Wellbeing\n\nMany of Tyson Foods\u2019 team members have physical, in-person jobs. To keep them safe, we focus on ensuring that all team members receive appropriate training and equipment. For example, every team member completes at least 13 hours of compliance, safety and food safety training per year, and new hourly employees receive 120 hours of classroom and on-the-job orientation. We leverage audits to reinforce compliance and continue to introduce new automated and ergonomic safety solutions. We also continue to invest in programs to expand health care access and encourage preventive care.\n\nOur goal is to achieve year-over-year reductions in workplace injuries and illnesses. In 2021, Tyson achieved both. Unfortunately, we were saddened during the year to experience two team member fatalities\u2014one road-related and one related to manufacturing. Such incidents make us even more committed to ongoing training and communication so that we can continue building a safe work environment for all.\n\nVaccinating Our Workforce\nIn August 2021, Tyson became the largest food company in the country to announce a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for all active U.S. team members. The mandate was critical in our commitment to keep team members, their families and plant communities safe. To support a vaccinated workforce, Tyson took several actions, including:\n\n- Hosting more than 100 on-site vaccine events open to workers and others in their homes.\n- Providing paid time off for vaccination education sessions and compensating workers vaccinated off-shift or off-site for up to four hours of regular pay.\n- Providing two weeks of paid leave for fully vaccinated workers who tested positive for the virus.\n- Delivering thank-you bonuses of $200 to vaccinated frontline workers and announcing that they can earn up to 20 hours of annual paid sick leave in 2022.\n- Partnering with Matrix Medical Network to provide expert resources and education for Tyson team members and their families, and to launch a pilot program to assess and address Tyson\u2019s COVID-19 protocols.\n\nThrough these efforts, Tyson achieved over 96% vaccination in our U.S. workforce by our Nov. 1, 2021 target. This achievement helped our team members and their families remain safe while enabling Tyson to continue to meet our customers\u2019 needs.\n\nPromoting a Culture of Health and Wellness\nTo encourage a healthier workforce, we are working to expand access to affordable, high-quality health care. In 2021, Tyson partnered with Marathon Health to pilot seven Bright Blue health centers near our production facilities. The centers, which serve nearly 38,000 team members and family members, deliver primary and preventive care at little-to-no cost for employees. We offered the centers\u2019 services in addition to regular benefits such as affordable health, life, dental and vision insurance. We also launched a partnership with Rx Savings Solutions to help U.S. team members and covered dependents obtain lower-cost prescription drugs.\n\nHosting more than 100 on-site vaccine events\nCommunity Investment\n\nWith facilities in more than 100 locations, Tyson Foods is uniquely positioned to help uplift communities across the U.S.\n\nOften, Tyson is a region\u2019s largest employer, with many team members working the front lines of rural processing plants. We invest deeply in our plant communities to address challenges related to housing, transportation, childcare, health care and access to nutritious food. To further our impact, we engage in strategic investments and partnerships while empowering team members to volunteer and give back.\n\nIn 2021, we focused on initiatives for hunger relief, disaster recovery and student success. To improve quality of life, we awarded $5 million to nonprofits delivering resources for childcare, health care, food access and housing.\n\nCreating Economic Opportunities at Tyson Plants\n\nTyson continues to expand operations to meet increased consumer demands\u2014creating many well-paying jobs in the process. In 2021, we announced a $300 million investment to build a new plant in Danville, Virginia. Complete with a 335,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art facility, the plant is expected to begin production in 2023 and create nearly 400 jobs. We also committed to purchasing 60 million pounds of Virginia-grown chicken to support the plant over the next three years. At our Pine Bluff, Arkansas, poultry plant, we committed to investing $48 million to increase operational capacity. The investment will create nearly 70 new jobs while increasing automation in our product packaging lines.\n\nSupporting Student and School Success\n\nOur Tyson K-12 business has long supported school foodservice programs through our Great Grant Giveaway program, awarding nearly $150,000 in funding over the past seven years. In 2021, this tradition continued with grants to six K-12 school foodservice teams with funds totaling $25,000 each. Our Hillshire Farm\u00ae SNACKED! brand also launched a new Allowance Grants program, which will award 41 grants\u2014including 38 $500 grants and three $2,000 grants\u2014to U.S. fourth- through sixth-graders working to create positive change. Additionally, Tyson\u2019s Star Ranch Angus brand is deeply committed to supporting early childhood literacy programs. In October 2021, they leveraged their Good Neighbor Initiative to deliver two grants, totaling $24,000, to support literacy resources for teachers and students in South Sioux City, Nebraska, and Silvis, Illinois.\nFighting Hunger Across the U.S.\nWhen it comes to fulfilling a community\u2019s basic needs, food security is non-negotiable. Yet across the U.S., many children and families lack access to the nutrition they need. In 2021, Tyson Foods provided $1.5 million in grants to support hunger relief in 38 plant communities. We also donated more than 16 million pounds of protein\u2014valued at $36 million and equivalent to 64 million meals\u2014to support food banks, pantries and hunger relief organizations.\n\nNearly 10 million pounds of food made its way to those in need through our Community Pantry Program, which includes 42 pantries and serves 35 communities across 19 states. We also celebrated the opening of Treehouse Pantry in Springdale, Arkansas, which will support up to 3,000 students and families by providing food, school supplies, clothing and products for hygiene and health. Along with more than 14,000 pounds of product, Tyson donated a $150,000 drive-in freezer that can hold up to 30 pallets of food.\n\nFor vulnerable communities, the COVID-19 pandemic has created heightened food-insecurity challenges and risks. In 2021, Tyson worked with Feed the Children and Americold to rapidly deliver more than 500,000 meals using an innovative supply chain model. Under this model, Tyson Foods is able to donate protein to Feed the Children, which is stored using Americold\u2019s temperature-controlled warehouses. Americold then donates the necessary storage space to Feed the Children. Our innovative supply chain model enabled a 300% efficiency rate, enabling Feed the Children to work with community partners to better serve those with urgent needs. We also partnered on an \u201cAlliance to Defeat Hunger\u201d tour to deliver food and other resources across the U.S.\n\nDisaster Relief\nTyson has long provided aid to communities recovering from natural disasters. In August 2021, we partnered with Convoy of Hope, Feed the Children, Salvation Army and other organizations to donate 650,000 meals and multiple truckloads of ice to Louisianans recovering from Hurricane Ida.\n\nIn December, we fed families and relief workers in Kentucky and Tennessee after a tornado caused widespread damage. By collaborating with Walmart and engaging team member volunteers across three states, Tyson donated the equivalent of about 260,000 pounds of protein through upwards of 1 million meals.\n\nThat same month, we partnered with the Kansas Livestock Association to donate $100,000 to Kansas cattle farmers and ranchers affected by an outbreak of wildfires in the state, where more than 5,800 Tyson team members live. Tyson partners with over 300 independent cattle producers in Kansas to purchase about $2 billion of cattle every year.\n\n2021 Alliance to Defeat Hunger Tour by the Numbers\n\n| 10 | U.S. cities visited |\n| 250+ tons | food and essentials delivered (valued at $1.9 million) |\n| 4 months | on the road |\n| 173 tons | protein items donated by Tyson |\n| 2 million | meals supplemented |\n| 85 tons | nonperishable food items, school supplies and household essentials delivered by food pantries at community schools |\nDriving Product Responsibility from Farm to Table\n\nTyson Foods has a long legacy of feeding people responsibly.\n\nNow, we are investing in industrywide innovation to work toward a more sustainable food system for the future. In our value chain, we are reimagining animal welfare and validating more sustainable packaging solutions. And across our brands, we are expanding our protein portfolio to meet more consumers\u2019 health and lifestyle needs. Beyond Tyson\u2019s own operations, we continue to forge strategic partnerships with leading-edge startups and organizations. By embracing new knowledge and best practices, we are raising the bar on how much good food can do.\nThe FarmCheck\u00ae audit program scope is based on a statistical analysis of each protein supply chain. This analysis allows Tyson Foods to determine the number of farms that should be audited each year so that, over a three-year period, we can be 99% confident that 95% or more of our supply chain complies with the standards of the program. In FY2021, 587 FarmCheck\u00ae audits were completed.\n\nVerified sustainable cattle production\u00b9 practices at scale, making Tyson the first U.S.-based meat company to do so\n\nReached a $100M+ total investment into Tyson Ventures to support startups and other companies focused on emerging proteins, new technologies for food and worker safety, and sustainable food production\n\nBecame 1st beef processor to join the U.S. CattleTrace program formed to develop a national infrastructure for animal disease traceability in U.S.\n\nLaunched 15 new plant-based protein products with new expansion into Asia Pacific markets\n\nAverage of 35.5% recycled content in corrugated packaging\u00b2\n\nLaunched a new environmental enrichment study at the Tyson Foods Center for Sustainable Broiler Welfare Research, which leverages animal preference to test which environmental enrichments broiler chickens prefer\n\n\u00b9 Number represents the number of cattle Tyson purchased from Progressive Beef\u2122 and BeefCARE\u2122-verified beef producers. Progressive Beef\u2122 and BeefCARE\u2122 are third-party environmental management and animal welfare verification programs for cattle ranchers. These programs identify ranchers, through third-party audits, who are committed to raising cattle using practices that positively impact the land and animals.\n\n\u00b2 Percentage of recycled content in corrugated packaging is the average recycled content of our suppliers\u2019 corrugated packaging products in 2021. The actual percentage of recycled content in packaging is highly dependent on box volume, box mix, acquisitions, divestitures and specification changes that can continually fluctuate from year to year. In addition, this average is close to the theoretical industry maximum of 40% for our industry class (refrigerated/frozen products, products that provide no internal load support and relatively heavy-weight selling units).\nNutrition, Access and Affordability\n\nA key driver of long-term health is access to nutritious foods. That includes access to high-quality protein products, which contain the amino acids our bodies need. Communities can face a range of barriers to essential nutrition access, including issues surrounding affordability. For instance, low-income groups often rely on food that is convenient and affordable but is lower in nutritional density.\n\nAt Tyson Foods, we\u2019re tackling health disparities and structural inequalities to expand access to nutritious, affordable food. We focus on product transparency and online customer engagement to empower people to make choices that meet their health and lifestyle needs. Our nutrition team maintains working relationships with several industry organizations and engages Tyson\u2019s business units to bring science-based best practices in house. In 2021, they informed the continued growth of our portfolio to help more people live and eat well. Our expanded offerings include new, renovated and reformulated products that are lower in sodium and saturated fats while containing more vitamins and fiber.\n\nThe Tyson brand is giving people more reasons to love chicken with convenient, better-for-you options that taste homemade.\u201d\n\u2014 Kate Lennox, Brand Manager, Tyson Chicken\n\nMaking Our Products Healthier than Ever\nTyson is a world-leading producer of nutritious protein products. In 2021, we expanded our portfolio with several innovative and healthy new options. Examples include:\n\n- **Tyson\u00ae Air Fried Chicken Bites**, which offer 75% less fat and 35% fewer calories than fast-food breaded chicken while delivering the same great taste and crunch.\n- **Tyson\u00ae Chicken Sausage**, which is made with 100% all-natural chicken that provides 13 grams of protein per serving with 60% less total fat and 45% fewer calories than sausages made with Italian pork.\n- **Raised & Rooted\u2122 Plant Based Bites**, which deliver delicious taste and have 8 grams of protein per serving, 3 grams of fiber and 33% less saturated fat than U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) white meat chicken nuggets.\n\nTyson Air Fried Chicken Bites have 75% less fat than fast-food breaded chicken\nProduct Quality and Safety\n\nFrom farm to consumer, Tyson Foods is committed to delivering products that are nutritious and safe. From the delivery of food to consumers to the safety of our team members, the environment and animals, we actively seek win-win opportunities to extend safety across our value chain. As a result, our food safety and quality assurance professional network comprises thousands of operations, engineering, supply chain and procurement team members who co-own food safety and quality. This integrated approach leads to a critical mass of food safety ownership, innovation and process execution. Tyson Foods\u2019 Laboratory Services Network is also involved in food safety testing and research, and our plants are federally inspected. USDA inspectors are stationed full-time at our processing plant sites to ensure compliance with federal meat inspection and labeling laws.\n\nWe also honor our commitment to producing safe, high-quality food by engaging in regular food safety audits. They enable us to grow consumers\u2019 confidence and provide rigorous feedback to help us fine-tune our food safety practices. Standards, such as those certified by the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI), serve as the baseline that we work hard to meet and exceed. We conduct audits via our corporate and plant food safety teams\u2014as well as through third-party auditors\u2014who provide audit information to federal regulators, customers and trusted certification bodies such as NSF International and Food Safety Net. We also ensure that our nutrition labels meet Tyson\u2019s own product transparency standards, as well as all government regulations and guidance. This includes regulations and guidelines from the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) and the USDA.\n\n100% of Tyson plants producing edible human food are GFSI certified\n\n97.3% of supplier facilities are GFSI certified\n\n100% of alleged noncompliance issues in routine USDA and FDA inspection reports are responded to in writing\n\nZero USDA and FDA regulatory enforcement actions in FY2021\nProduct Innovation\n\nIn 2021, there were 7.9 billion people in the world. By 2030, that number will grow to approximately 8.5 billion.\n\nAccording to the U.N., our ability to support that growth will largely depend on two factors: first, manufacturing and consumption patterns, and second, the ability to develop more efficient, sustainable solutions. With that in mind, Tyson Foods\u2019 team of food scientists, chefs, nutritionists and activists are hyper-focused on innovating new products to feed our growing world.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Plant Protein\n\nAs consumers\u2019 lifestyles and food preferences shift, we continue to evolve our products and brands. Over the next five years, the alternative protein category is projected to continually grow, and Tyson is aggressively building capacity to expand our plant-based protein portfolio. Since launching our plant-based protein brand, Raised & Rooted\u2122, in 2019, we have expanded brand availability to over 10,000 retail stores nationwide. In 2021, we expanded the brand to launch new plant-based bites, burger patties and sausages\u2014all of which offer the nutritious benefits of traditional options with reduced saturated fat.\n\nWe also introduced new plant-based options in our Jimmy Dean\u00ae brand, launching two new breakfast sandwiches featuring a plant-based patty. And for the first time, we introduced plant-based products in regions throughout Asia, with the launch of a new brand, First Pride\u2122. Expansion across the Asia Pacific market aligns with our aim to make more high-quality protein choices accessible and affordable around the world.\n\nDisrupting the Food Industry with Tyson Ventures\n\nTo accelerate food industry innovation, we invest heavily in research and development\u2014both within our own company and to support disruptive innovators working to provide sustainable nutrition to our growing world. Through Tyson Ventures, we have invested more than $100 million to support startups and companies with breakthrough ideas and innovations. We focus our investments on new protein and food tech innovation and technologies for food and worker safety, and sustainable food production. As we continue to grow the Tyson Ventures portfolio, we have announced our first Shark Tank-style Demo Day event to be held virtually in 2022. During the event, companies will demonstrate the ways they can create a more sustainable food system to support generations to come.\nSustainable Packaging\n\nProper packaging is important to keep Tyson Foods\u2019 products protected, fresh and safe. We envision a future where all our food products are protected in packaging materials designed for recyclability, reusability or compostability, while also identifying opportunities to minimize packaging mass. That includes reducing reliance on fuel-based plastics to the extent feasible through elimination of plastic in packaging that is unnecessary for a quality or safety reason and using recycled content or bio-based plastics if available. At the same time, our packaging must be durable enough to endure handling through receipt, inventory, packing use, distribution, point of sale, consumer use and disposal, as well as meeting our high standards for food compatibility and safety.\n\nIn 2021, we worked on sustainable packaging solutions for several of our products, including:\n\n- **Raised & Rooted\u2122** trays containing 15% post-consumer recycled (PCR) content.\n- **True Meals\u2122** in pouches containing 13% PCR plastic.\n\nWe work hard to ensure that Tyson products are clearly labeled and have instructions on how packaging materials can be disposed or recycled. For example, most Tyson products have packaging with How2Recycle logos and labels, which provide information and instructions for consumers on steps to recycle packaging and packaging components.\n\nWe also began testing the validation of new recyclable, pulp fiber trays to replace traditional trays made of foam, and we partnered with our film suppliers to develop recycle-ready flexible films. This work explored:\n\n- 100% recyclable Thermoformable pouches, which can deliver up to a 37% carbon footprint reduction and up to a 14% reduction in water consumption compared to current materials, even if not recycled.\n- 100% recyclable pouches for our Grilled & Ready\u00ae Chicken Breast Strips.\n- Flow wrap ground beef, which delivers up to a 47% carbon footprint reduction and up to a 53% reduction in water consumption compared to the current packaging system, even if not recycled.\n- Integrated paperboard and liner, which delivers up to a 90% reduction in plastic compared to the traditional liner.\n\n(1) Tyson Foods sold this business in FY2021.\n\nTested options for up to 20% reduction in the Grilled & Ready\u00ae Chicken Breast Strips pouches\u2019 carbon footprint compared to current laminated packaging, even if not recycled.\nAnimal Health and Welfare\n\nTyson Foods\u2019 vision is to be the world leader in animal welfare through compassionate care that is based on sound science. Our Office of Animal Welfare leads our efforts to support welfare culture and performance throughout our business. We understand that welfare extends beyond the animals themselves and includes the environments where they live. Accordingly, we employ a team of dedicated animal welfare specialists, invest in high quality equipment and facilities, and use innovation and research to drive continuous improvement. Our welfare strategy emphasizes transparent communication, and we regularly engage with animal health and welfare organizations that share Tyson\u2019s mission and vision.\n\nIn 2021, we transitioned to a progressive new animal welfare framework across our global operations. The Five Domains framework includes four domains\u2014nutrition, health, behavioral opportunities and physical environment\u2014that contribute to a fifth domain focused on the animal\u2019s mental state. The framework is adaptable to each species\u2019 behavior, biology and ecology and allows us to assess animal welfare more accurately and comprehensively. We use the framework in our efforts to continually improve conditions for animals such as chickens, cattle and hogs.\n\nSupporting Cattle Health and Disease Traceability\nTo maintain steady operations in the U.S. beef industry, animal disease traceability is key. Tyson was the first beef processor to join the U.S. CattleTrace program in 2021, which was formed by cattlemen\u2019s organizations working to address the issue across multiple states. The program utilizes ear tags to track an animal\u2019s GPS location from birth to harvest. In the case of a disease outbreak, animal health officials can use the data to respond quickly and effectively.\n\nImproving Poultry Welfare\nIn 2021, we completed construction on the Tyson Foods Center for Sustainable Broiler Welfare Research. The center is home to our state-of-the-art Broiler Welfare Research Farm, where we scientifically evaluate the impact of welfare practices on broiler chickens\u2019 behavior.\n\nOur animal welfare team, for example, embarked on a study using animal preferences to test which environmental enrichments broiler chickens prefer. In collaboration with researchers from the University of Arkansas, they tested enrichments such as ramps, huts and boxes, with initial results showing a strong preference for the huts. Pending results from another round of testing, the team plans to use its findings to roll out environmental enrichments in Tyson chicken houses throughout the U.S. We have collaborated with the University of Arkansas on this research, which was funded through a grant provided by the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association.\n\nTo learn more about our animal welfare practices, please visit tysonsustainability.com.\nWorking Toward Sustaining Natural Resources and Achieving Net Zero\n\nTo feed a growing world, we need to build a more sustainable food system.\n\nTyson Foods works directly with independent farmers, ranchers and producers to improve the resilience of our food systems and conserve natural resources for generations to come. Across our operations and supply chain, we\u2019re focused on minimizing waste and being good stewards of water and land, and mapping out a plan that prioritizes renewable energy. Through strategic partnerships with advocacy groups, nonprofit organizations, and independent farmers and ranchers, we continue to pilot and scale programs aimed at reducing environmental risks and sustainable growth. These efforts are part of our global aspiration to achieve net-zero GHG emissions, which we were proud to announce in 2021.\nHow We Worked to Sustain Natural Resources\n\nAnnounced, in 2021, our ambition to achieve **net-zero** GHG emissions, including Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions, by 2050\n\nAchieved Alliance for Water Stewardship certification for three U.S. plants\n\nRecognized by the North American Meat Institute in 2022 for continuous environmental improvement at **44 plants**\n\nAchieved **ZWTL** gold-level validation at six U.S. plants in FY2022 where 95% to 99% of certain waste streams has been diverted from landfills\n\nAchieved **56%** reduction in product processing waste in FY2022 and $813,945 in savings through our tankage waste reduction initiative in the first half of 2022\n\nDiverted **35+ tons** of food waste from our Springdale, Arkansas, headquarters through our Composting Waste Program in partnership with Food Loops since the pilot began in 2018\n\nBegan to assess potential for a new environmental data management system to improve the accuracy, consistency and validity of emissions data\n\nDeveloped a GHG emissions accounting framework focused on beef to capture cradle-to-gate emissions and verify emission reductions through more sustainable agricultural practices\nClimate\n\nAs a leader in the food industry, Tyson Foods is working to also lead climate action by reimagining our supply chain from farm to plate. That means mapping out plans for renewable energy and reducing our transportation-based GHG emissions.\n\nIn 2021, we announced our ambition to achieve net-zero GHG emissions across our global operations and supply chain by 2050, including Scopes 1, 2 and 3. This expands upon our Science Based Target of achieving a 30% absolute GHG emissions reduction by 2030, for Scopes 1 and 2, which aligned to prior climate goals of minimizing global temperature rise to 2.0\u00b0C. Key targets along our path to net zero include:\n\n- Updating our baseline for emissions to include business operations acquired since our initial calculations and align with the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C by the end of 2023.\n- Increasing our domestic use of renewable energy\u2014both purchased and self-generated\u2014to 50% by 2030.\n- Eliminating deforestation risk from direct and indirect sourcing of cattle and beef; palm oil (direct and embedded); soy (direct and embedded); and pulp, paper and packaging throughout our global supply chain by 2030.\n\nTo update our GHG emissions baseline, we are recalculating our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. In 2021, we began an internal quality assurance and control process that uses statistical analysis to identify data outliers, which could be potential errors, in Tyson\u2019s emissions data. We also evaluated the potential for a new environmental data management system to improve the accuracy, consistency and validity of our company\u2019s emissions data. While the system will primarily focus on energy and emissions data, we are also assessing opportunities to include other environmental metrics, such as water and waste.\n\nSustainable Beef\n\nAs the largest GHG-emitting protein type in the agriculture sector and a significant contributor to our carbon footprint, beef is a key emission source in our value chain that we\u2019re working with beef producers, nonprofits and research organizations to address. Tyson was the first U.S. food company to verify sustainable cattle production practices at scale, and, at the end of 2021, we began developing a beef-focused GHG emissions accounting framework to capture cradle-to-gate emissions. Key strategic partners in this work are The Nature Conservancy and Environmental Defense Fund. We aspire to expand our current target to verify sustainable beef production practices on more than 5 million acres of U.S. cattle-grazing land by 2025.\nWater\n\nWater is an important resource for Tyson Foods\u2019 business and for the communities where we work and live.\n\nIn large part, water is used to feed and raise animals, with a smaller amount used for production processes within our facilities. Our water stewardship program focuses on using water as efficiently and responsibly as possible, especially in regions where water is scarce. We also maintain high standards for water quality, which is key to keeping our customers and communities safe.\n\nOur Work with the Alliance for Water Stewardship\n\nAs a member of the Alliance for Water Stewardship, we contribute to the sustainability of local water resources through our adoption and promotion of the International Water Stewardship Standard. In 2019, Tyson committed to developing Contextual Water Plans at 11 of our high-risk locations in the U.S. by 2025.\n\nWe have completed six of these plans to date at Finney County, Kansas; Seguin, North Richland Hills and Amarillo, Texas; Dexter, Missouri; and Temperanceville, Virginia. The site-specific plans consist of water quantity initiatives to reduce or conserve practices on Tyson property, water quality targets to reduce or protect nutrient risk to the source, water governance and important water-related area targets to enhance existing relationships and promote good partnerships in the watershed, and water access, safety and hygiene (WASH), a target aimed at highlighting Tyson\u2019s existing safety regulations in direct operations for team members while ensuring equal availability for the community.\n\nUsing Wastewater Treatment to Generate Renewable Natural Gas\n\nIn January 2021, we launched an innovative partnership with Cross River Infrastructure Partners, NW Natural and BioCarbN to convert methane from several Tyson wastewater facilities into renewable natural gas (RNG). By accessing biogas derived from wastewater treatment facilities at our plants, the project is expected to generate more than 1.2 million MMBtu of RNG each year\u2014enough to provide heat for about 18,000 homes NW Natural serves in Oregon.\nLand\n\nAs a world-leading protein provider, Tyson Foods collaborates with a large network of independent ranchers and farmers, who care for and cultivate the land. A key area of our value chain is row crops, which feed Tyson-owned chickens and support our suppliers\u2019 cattle and hogs. We work with U.S. corn growers to implement climate-smart row crop practices that reduce GHG emissions, enhance the natural carbon sink of agricultural soils, improve soil health and reduce overall costs. Three years ago, we announced a goal to support climate-smart practices on 2 million acres of row crop by 2025\u2014the largest land stewardship commitment ever made by a U.S. protein company.\n\nAs our land stewardship work faced significant challenges tactically and economically, in 2021 we began developing a plan to work directly with row crop farmers in the grain supply to work toward our 2-million-acre goal by 2025, with efforts to purchase 100% of our feed from growers engaged in climate-smart practices by 2030. Over the last several years, we\u2019ve worked with various partners, including Farmers Business Network and Environmental Defense Fund to execute pilot projects\u2014including on almost 370,000 acres of farmland in 2021\u2014relying on their expertise and thoughtful approach as we\u2019ve navigated opportunities and challenges to advance our land stewardship goals. We are evaluating and using the learnings from these pilot initiatives to help inform our path forward as we look to have a continued collaborative approach in land stewardship across the supply chain. Similarly, we are working to expand our current target to verify sustainable beef production practices on grazing lands beyond the initial 5 million acre targets. To begin to achieve the target, we are sourcing cattle from ranchers verified by BeefCARE\u2122, an independent third-party auditor to verify that farmers and ranchers are using best practices in caring for animals, the environment and the people and communities who support them.\n\nProtecting Our Forests\nAlong our path to net-zero GHG emissions, our commitment to forest protection is an important step. In 2021, we announced a 2030 target to make our global value chain for direct and indirect sourcing of cattle and beef; palm oil (direct and embedded); soy (direct and embedded); and pulp, paper and packaging deforestation-free. Based on a deforestation risk assessment conducted with PROFOREST in 2019, Tyson has low or no risk of deforestation across nearly 94% of our company\u2019s land footprint. To proactively address the remaining 6% of our value chain, we developed a Forest Protection Standard, as well as country-specific commodity action plans (CAPs). In 2021, we addressed new goals for commodities from high-risk countries including using:\n\n- 100% verified deforestation-free beef from Australasia by the end of 2025 and from Latin America by the end of 2028.\n- 100% responsibly sourced direct soy, paper and packaging by the end of 2025.\n- 100% responsibly sourced direct palm oil by the end of 2025.\n- 100% responsibly sourced embedded palm oil by the end of 2030.\n\nTo be considered responsibly sourced and compliant with the Forest Protection Standard, suppliers will be expected to meet the principles and criteria of applicable leading deforestation standards and criteria. For example, suppliers of pulp, paper and packaging will be asked to certify all virgin content sourced from jurisdictions of concern to Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI\u00ae), Forest Stewardship Council (FSC\u00ae) and other standards. Suppliers of palm oil will be asked to comply with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) Supply Chain Certification (SCC) standard audit. Tyson Thailand has also been approved as an RSPO-certified company after a successful RSPO SCC standards audit on March 25, 2022. In the upcoming year, we will continue to evaluate our country-specific CAPs, implementation strategy and corresponding goals.\nWaste\n\nThe world has finite resources, and Tyson Foods is working to ensure that far fewer of them wind up in landfills.\n\nWe focus on diverting operational waste and recycling packaging materials through ZWTL projects at several plants. Additionally, we ensure the proper disposal of hazardous materials and waste through our Hazardous Waste Management Standard. It is based on federal requirements, as well as Tyson-specific and industrywide standards, and includes guidance on the segregation, signage and container requirements to which all U.S. plants must adhere.\n\nDiverting Product Processing and Food Waste\n\nThroughout our operations and supply chain, we actively seek opportunities to eliminate or minimize waste from food and products. For example, in our animal processing operations, we avoid waste from byproducts by instead producing products such as animal feed, biofuels and fertilizer.\n\nIn 2021, we made progress on our ZWTL pilot projects, which we launched in 2020 and have continued into 2022. To date, six of our U.S. plants have achieved ZWTL gold-level validation, which requires plants to divert 95% to 99% of their waste from landfills. Meanwhile, at our Springdale, Arkansas, headquarters, we continued our partnership with Food Loops to compost cafeteria-based waste. Through the program, Food Loops collects team members\u2019 food waste and puts it through a decomposition process, creating a more natural, nutrient-rich soil enhancer for area farmers, landscapers and gardeners. Tyson became the first large corporation to partner with Food Loops in 2018 and, to date, has diverted over 35 tons of food waste.\n\nWe also launched a new initiative to reduce product processing waste by focusing on composting, supporting animal sanctuaries and donating products for hunger relief. While the initiative is ongoing, it helped Tyson achieve a 56% reduction and $813,945 in savings during the first half of FY2022. By the end of FY2022, we are targeting a year-over-year reduction of 75%.\n\nUpcycling Plastic Water Bottles with Tyson\u2019s Repreve\u00ae Manager Polos\n\nEach day, our managers lead by example, and that includes reducing waste. In 2021, Tyson invested in polo shirts for our managers\u2019 uniforms made with Repreve\u00ae, an eco-conscious fabric sourced from recycled water bottles. According to Repreve\u00ae, each women\u2019s shirt is made from 17 recycled bottles and each men\u2019s shirt is made from 19 bottles, resulting in a reduced use of petroleum in the manufacturing process and energy savings.\n## CORPORATE METRICS\n\n| Financial Impact                                      | FY2018 | FY2019 | FY2020 | FY2021 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Revenues ($ billion)                                  | $40.10 | $42.40 | $43.20 | $47.00 |\n| Net Income ($ billion)                                | $ 3.00 | $ 2.00 | $ 2.10 | $ 3.00 |\n| Total Assets ($ billion)                              | $29.10 | $33.10 | $34.50 | $36.30 |\n| Research and Development Spending ($ million)         | $114.00| $97.00 | $98.00 | $114.00|\n\n| Production                                            |        |        |        |        |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Beef (approx. avg. head per week)                     | 133,000| 155,000| 155,000| 155,000|\n| Beef (avg. capacity utilization)                      | 77%    | 77%    | 77%    | 78%    |\n| Pork (approx. avg. head per week)                     | 408,000| 461,000| 461,000| 469,000|\n| Pork (avg. capacity utilization)                      | 90%    | 90%    | 90%    | 88%    |\n| Chicken (approx. avg. head per week)                  | 37,000,000| 45,000,000| 45,000,000| 47,000,000|\n| Chicken (avg. capacity utilization)                   | 84%    | 84%    | 84%    | 79%    |\n| Prepared Foods (approx. avg. pounds per week)         | 66,000,000| 76,000,000| 74,000,000| 73,000,000|\n| Prepared Foods (avg. capacity utilization)            | 81%    | 81%    | 81%    | 79%    |\n\n| Supplier                                              |        |        |        |        |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total Farmers                                         | 9,248  | 9,247  | >16,827| 18,968 |\n| Chicken Farmers                                       | 3,564  | 3,925  | 3,890  | 3,961  |\n| Cattle Farmers                                        | 3,775  | 3,607  | 3,358  | 3,228  |\n| Hog Farmers                                           | 1,811  | 1,617  | 1,483  | 1,141  |\n| Turkey Farmers                                        | 98     | 98     | 96     | 93     |\n| Tyson Local Grain Services Grain Suppliers            | NA     | NA     | >8,000 | 10,545 |\n### Food Safety and Quality Assurance (FSQA)\n\n|                                | FY2018 | FY2019 | FY2020 | FY2021 |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| ISO 17025 Accredited Labs     | 16     | 16     | 16     | 18     |\n| Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) Certified Plants | 104    | 113    | 114    | 120    |\n| Safe Quality Food (SQF) Certified Plants | 25     | 35     | 33     | 37     |\n| British Retail Consortium (BRC) Certified Plants | 79     | 78     | 81     | 83     |\n| Class 1 and 2 Product Recalls  | 2 (3)  | 5 (4)  | 1 (5)  | 1 (6)  |\n| Customer Complaints (per million units) (7) | Not reported | Not reported | Not reported | 2.54 |\n\n(1) This data includes our U.S. operations (96% of revenues in FY2021).
