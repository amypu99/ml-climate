I am pleased that we ranked #2 on the 2022 Access to Medicine Index, which evaluates the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical companies on their efforts to distribute medicines to low- and middle-income countries. We also exceeded our Health for Humanity 2025 Goal to support 1.3 million frontline health workers with tools and training. Other initiatives include the Johnson & Johnson Center for Health Worker Innovation, which has committed $16 million over three years to the Africa Frontline First Catalytic Fund to expand the professional workforce of community health workers in ten African countries.\n\nEmpowering our employees. Our continued focus on accelerating diversity, equity and inclusion outcomes helps us meet the changing needs of the communities we serve. I am proud that we achieved our Health for Humanity 2025 Goal of reaching 35 percent racial and ethnic diversity in U.S. management roles. We are also on track to achieve gender parity for women in management positions around the world. To upskill our employees, we launched J&J Learn, a dynamic development ecosystem to ensure easy access to learning and growth opportunities. We also enhanced mental health resources for our employees and their families.\n\nAdvancing environmental health. In 2022, we secured a deal to source 100 percent renewable electricity for our operations in Brazil. We also joined a collaboration of pharmaceutical companies to support ingredient suppliers\u2019 efforts to decarbonize. In addition, we expanded our pharmaceuticals U.S. Safe Returns program to Switzerland, with plans to add more countries this year. Also in Europe, we expanded our single-use device hospital recycling program to eight countries.\n\nLeading with accountability and innovation. Grounded in the belief that science and technology will advance healthcare more in this decade than in the last century, we invested nearly $15 billion in R&D in 2022 and integrated digital capabilities into how we work.\n\nAlready, the use of data science in drug discovery has advanced our three treatments for multiple myeloma, the second most common blood cancer, providing transformational care for cancer patients.\n\nData science is also applied to our R&D ecosystem of medical devices, software and robotics solutions, helping healthcare providers care for patients with greater precision and efficiency. Following the acquisition of Abiomed, Inc., the world leader in heart recovery solutions, we are integrating their technology and expanding our leadership in cardiovascular care.\n\nTechnology is also helping our supply chain make leaps forward in productivity, efficiency and sustainability. This fact was recognized by the World Economic Forum, which has granted 11 (three new in 2022) Lighthouse designations to our manufacturing facilities.\n\nAs we reflect on 2022\u2019s accomplishments, we do so with an eye to a different but no less exciting future. In 2023, we are on track to advance two global companies: Kenvue\u2014a new consumer health company\u2014and Johnson & Johnson\u2014dedicated to Pharmaceutical and MedTech\u2014that will be uniquely positioned in a fast-moving healthcare landscape.\n\nIn this report, you will discover many other insights about how Johnson & Johnson is creating long-term and sustainable value. In the years to come, we are committed to lead and seize opportunities for humanity while following Our Credo values.\n\nThank you for your interest.\n\nJoaquin Duato\nChairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nQ&A With Our Lead Director\n\nAnne M. Mulcahy, Lead Director of the Johnson & Johnson Board of Directors, plays a pivotal role in ensuring our Board is deeply engaged with our ESG strategy and progress. Anne shares some insights below in response to questions that reflect current interests of key stakeholders.\n\nHow have changes in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s business environment in 2022 affected the nature of the Board\u2019s oversight responsibilities?\n\nAs a Board at the helm of a very dynamic organization, we are constantly evaluating how a changing world is affecting the Company\u2019s business and how we as a Board must respond to both current and emerging challenges, and also to opportunities. This was particularly true in 2022, as the Company navigated social unrest and conflict in many parts of the world, supply chain issues, increased inflation and interest rates, extreme weather events and more... all while preparing for a successful separation of the Consumer Health business segment.\n\nJohnson & Johnson has long thrived in a changing environment; the Company has been doing so for more than 135 years. As the Independent Lead Director for the Johnson & Johnson Board of Directors, I work closely with our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer as he focuses on the Company\u2019s trajectory of long-term growth. Our current Board structure\u2014an Independent Lead Director and five standing Committees comprised entirely of independent Directors\u2014provides robust leadership and oversight. But the Board\u2019s oversight and, at times, the responsibilities for our standing Committees, must evolve to meet our fiduciary obligations and the changing needs of the Company. For example, in 2021, the Board formed a Special Committee to oversee the separation of the Consumer Health business, and this Special Committee remained active through 2022.\n\nHow has Johnson & Johnson embedded ESG into its business operations?\n\nJohnson & Johnson has a longstanding commitment to creating long-term value for all stakeholders both to mitigate risk and to explore and develop new business opportunities. These responsibilities are outlined in the Company\u2019s Credo, a set of business principles that have guided the Company for 80 years. The Board\u2019s understanding of\u2014and perspective on\u2014environmental, social and governance matters and their relevance to value creation has evolved significantly over the past several years, and we have taken many opportunities to engage with the business to help guide ESG considerations in decision making across many aspects of the Company\u2019s activities. For example, we supported the formalization of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s ESG strategy in 2022 and monitored progress on the ESG strategy-aligned Health for Humanity 2025 Goals. This plays out in the integration of global health equity\u2014a core ESG key focus area\u2014in different business processes. For example, Janssen, the Company\u2019s pharmaceutical business, actively addresses health inequities by improving diverse recruitment for clinical trials and supporting the next generation of underrepresented diverse physicians. Advancing environmental health is another ESG priority, and J&J MedTech, is advancing circularity by partnering with hospitals in Europe to recycle metal and plastic components from single-use surgical instruments. The program is currently active in eight countries. We\u2019re very excited about these projects, and more like them are underway.\n\nWe have taken many opportunities to engage with the business to help guide ESG considerations in decision making across many aspects of the Company\u2019s activities.\n\nWith increasing regulation expected in ESG matters in the U.S. and other countries around the world, will the role of the Board become more about compliance than opportunity?\n\nAs a highly regulated business, Johnson & Johnson relies on our Board\u2019s oversight and, at times, the responsibilities for our Board, and we view compliance and business opportunity as closely linked\u2014not in tension\u2014when it comes to our strategy. Ethical and compliant conduct is the basis for a successful business and can be an enabler of opportunity by addressing ESG matters in a strategic and holistic way.\n\nOur Board at Johnson & Johnson realized this connection long ago, and we have significantly integrated ESG matters in our Board agenda. For example, in 2021, I joined the Board Committee Chairs overseeing risk and sustainability topics in engaging in the Company\u2019s most recent ESG Priority Topics Assessment, the results of which have informed the Company\u2019s reporting and disclosure and will play a significant role in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s next set of public goals.\n\nIn 2022, the Board decided to realign Committee responsibilities and enhanced and expanded the scope of the Regulatory Compliance & Sustainability Committee. This action better positions the Board to oversee certain ESG matters alongside other compliance matters.\n\nWhat do you believe to be the greatest opportunity that Johnson & Johnson has to create long-term value for all stakeholders?\n\nFinancial results will always be an important measure of performance, but Johnson & Johnson will continue its sustainable long-term growth through operating with a focus on the future and by refusing to compromise on Our Credo values. It is a core responsibility of the Board to capitalize on the Company\u2019s position of strength as a leader in healthcare by guiding Johnson & Johnson to sustain and exceed its investment in lifesaving and life-enhancing innovations, benefiting millions of patients and consumers each year.\nYear in Brief\n\nChampion global health equity\n\n>180 million\npatients treated with a Janssen medicine\n\n>586,000\ncumulative doses of SIRTURO (bedaquiline) treatments for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis shipped\n\n#2\nranking in the 2022 Access to Medicine Index, reflecting our strategy to enable access to our medicines and technologies for people in low- and middle-income countries\n\n1.3 million\nnurses, midwives and community health workers supported with skills, tools and growth through the Johnson & Johnson Center for Health Worker Innovation, exceeding the Health for Humanity Goal\n\nEmpower our employees\n\n36%\nethnic/racial diversity in management positions within the U.S., achieving the Health for Humanity 2025 Goal\n\n>130,000\nemployees (92%) responded to Our Credo Survey, with an 87% favorability rate among participants\u2014a testament to our values-driven culture\n\nJ&J Learn\nlaunched as a dynamic learning and development ecosystem that empowers employees with continuous opportunities for reskilling, upskilling and development\n\nAdvance environmental health\n\n100%\nrenewable electricity secured for our operations in Brazil starting in 2023 through a Direct Power Purchase Agreement\n\nCDP A List\nfor leadership in climate action for the fifth year in a row\n\nNew multiyear collaborative initiative\n(DICE\u2014Digital Health in a Circular Economy) launched by Janssen, with co-funding from the EU Horizon Europe program, to address digital health waste\n\nLead with accountability and innovation\n\n$14.6 billion\ninvested in research and development across our businesses\n\nResponsibility Standards for Suppliers\nupdated with expanded expectations on supplier diversity, equity and inclusion, information security and environmental responsibility\n\n105,000\nemployees completed Health Care Compliance training, the highest completion number to date\n\n1 Funded in part by the Johnson & Johnson Foundation, a registered charity and a company limited by guarantee, and by the Corporation and operating companies across the Johnson & Johnson Family of Companies.

We work with more than 46,000 suppliers and hundreds of external manufacturers to support the development and manufacturing of our products worldwide. The Company\u2019s product portfolio includes thousands of Pharmaceutical, MedTech and Consumer Health products that address the health and wellness needs of people every day.\n\nFinancial Results (Millions)\nJohnson & Johnson is a publicly owned corporation with stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:JNJ).\n\nSales by Business Segment (Millions)\n\n| Segment          | 2022 Sales (Millions) | 2021 Sales (Millions) |\n|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Pharmaceutical   | $52,563               | $47,953               |\n| MedTech          | $27,427               | $24,277               |\n| Consumer Health* | $14,953               | $14,953               |\n\n* Includes dividend declared in April 2023.\n\nR&D investment\n\n| Year | R&D Investment (Millions) |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| 2021 | $14,603                   |\n| 2022 | $14,714                   |\n\nNet earnings\n\n| Year | Net Earnings (Millions) |\n|------|-------------------------|\n| 2021 | $17,941                 |\n| 2022 | $20,878                 |\n\nTotal sales\n\n| Year | Total Sales (Millions) |\n|------|------------------------|\n| 2021 | $94,943                |\n| 2022 | $93,775                |\n\n$176.65 Market price per share (year-end close)\n\n61 Consecutive years of dividend increases*\n\n* Includes dividend declared in April 2023.\n\n4 Abiomed headcount is not included in this total employee number due to year-end acquisition timing and our Human Resources Information System integration processes.\nESG Governance\n\nThe Company\u2019s dedication to integrating ESG into our business strategies starts at the highest levels of leadership, where the Board has overall accountability for ESG risk management oversight.\n\nEffective ESG governance requires both management engagement and Board-level oversight. The Board\u2019s ESG risk management approach is designed to effectively govern and manage the ESG risks and opportunities that are integral to the Company\u2019s core business strategy. Significant ESG risks are reviewed and evaluated by the Board and its Committees as part of their ongoing risk oversight of our Company.\n\nIn 2022, we improved ESG governance matters in the following ways:\n\n\u2022 We announced our evolved ESG strategy, focused on championing global health equity, empowering our employees and advancing environmental health. Leading with accountability and innovation is foundational to these efforts.\n\n\u2022 The Enterprise Governance Council, the Company\u2019s primary governance body for ESG matters, updated its ESG knowledge module and made it available to all employees to help them understand our ESG management approach, including our ESG strategy.\n\n\u2022 We held our fifth investor relations ESG webcast in June 2022, to update shareholders on our ESG performance and progress against our Health for Humanity 2025 Goals. The webcast included an interview with members of the Johnson & Johnson Board of Directors and our Chief Financial Officer.\n\n\u2022 We continued to improve our disclosures on ESG topics, including enhancing our Tax Policy, Position on Disaster Relief and Position on Employee Development. We also expanded disclosures with additional metrics for greater transparency.\n\nESG Priorities\n\nAt Johnson & Johnson, we use our materiality assessment, which we call our Priority Topics Assessment (PTA), to identify, prioritize and strategically address relevant ESG topics that can have a significant impact on society or our business. Since 2008, we have conducted the PTA every two to three years. Our last PTA was conducted in 2021 with a double materiality focus, by which we examined ESG priority topics from two standpoints: the impact of a topic on Johnson & Johnson\u2019s business results and the impact of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s business on people, the environment and society in general. Our Priority Topics Matrix presents our ESG priorities.\nESG Strategy\n\nOur ESG strategy is grounded in Our Credo values, informed by both our Company\u2019s purpose to change the trajectory of health for humanity and the views of our external stakeholders. We set our ESG strategy in a deliberate manner, focusing our efforts on the areas where we are well positioned to achieve the greatest impact: championing global health equity, empowering our employees and advancing environmental health. Leading with accountability and innovation is foundational to these efforts. Our ESG approach is designed to effectively govern and manage all risks, including ESG risks, while also enabling us to identify opportunities that accurately reflect our business strategy. This sustained, focused approach promotes resiliency and drives growth, better positioning us to continue investing for our future and enhancing the long-term value of our business.\n\nFor more information on how we help our stakeholders understand how we are managing the risk of these relevant ESG topics and embedding sustainability into decision making, which is a critical component of our ESG governance, please see our ESG Strategy and our ESG Resources.\n\nStakeholder Engagement\n\nThe deep and longstanding relationships we cultivate with our stakeholders are vital to our business success and our ESG strategy. Johnson & Johnson interacts with numerous stakeholder groups at the global, national and local levels, including through membership of, and participation in, a broad range of advocacy organizations and industry associations. Learn more \u2192\n\nIn 2022, our targeted engagement activities included:\n\nPromoting health legislation in the U.S.: The U.S. maternal mortality rate continues to exceed the rate of other high-income countries, including a 40% increase in 2021. In the U.S., Medicaid has a vital role to play in improving maternal health outcomes, with nearly half of all births financed by Medicaid. We strongly supported state efforts to advance legislation to extend Medicaid postpartum coverage to 12 months for new mothers, helping address disproportionate maternal mortality outcomes in disadvantaged communities.\n\nJohnson & Johnson also joined more than 70 healthcare organizations in advocating for the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act (H.R. 1667), the first ever federal legislation in the U.S. directed at protecting the mental health of the country\u2019s healthcare workforce to facilitate the reduction and prevention of suicide, burnout and mental and behavioral health conditions among HCPs. The Act became law in March 2022.\n\nWhile health worker burnout had reached a crisis point before the COVID-19 pandemic, the acute mental health needs and risk factors among HCPs were brought into sharp focus in the early days of 2020 as health workers experienced severe work trauma, burnout, and exhaustion. The tragic death by suicide of emergency room physician, Dr. Lorna Breen, in April 2020, underscored the urgent need to provide better support services to health workers. In July 2020, Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) introduced a bill to protect the mental health of the healthcare workforce. Developed alongside the Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes\u2019 Foundation with support from Johnson & Johnson, this bill would eventually become the Dr. Lorna Breen Healthcare Provider Protection Act. Learn more \u2192\nSupporting healthcare policy making in Europe: As the founding knowledge partner and sponsor of All Policies for a Healthy Europe Coalition, we strengthened our partnership on the development of numerous publications and policy dialogues by the coalition in three areas: the economy of well-being (covering the COVID-19 pandemic response, health systems resilience, value-based healthcare and the EU Beating Cancer policies); the digitalization of health (contributing our expertise to emerging data governance, the European Health Data Space and AI policies); and environmental health (supporting the revision of the ambient air directive).\n\nJanssen has been a leading industry voice shaping the EU Pharmaceutical Strategy, championing patient access to medicines and strong IP rights. We have shone a light on the changes in EU legislation that would diminish IP rights, a critical element underpinning medical innovation in Europe. Janssen provides evidence and data to help stakeholders appreciate the need for strong IP protections to develop new treatments to address unmet medical needs. We also advocate for an agile regulatory framework that will allow fast adoption of innovative new medicines supported through the use of real-world evidence, digital health technology and data sharing. Our activities in 2022 included direct dialogue with European policymakers and other stakeholders, along with yearlong media engagement, adding our voice to the public debate.\n\nNot every asset that we start working on actually makes it to the finish line. IP allows us to generate return for the value that we bring to patients and society once the therapy is available, and that\u2019s a return that we actually reinvest into developing new advanced lifesaving and breakthrough therapies.\n\nStrengthening the healthcare industry in Asia: Johnson & Johnson led the healthcare industry presence at the 2022 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders\u2019 Week in Bangkok, Thailand, as the only healthcare company speaking at the event. APEC is a critical and highly influential forum, driving improvements in healthcare policy, innovation and access across this large and diverse region of the world. The Leader\u2019s Week was the first in-person APEC gathering since 2019 and a significant opportunity for our global delegation to engage with heads of state and government leaders from all 21 APEC countries, industry and academia. We shared Johnson & Johnson\u2019s perspective on key healthcare challenges and the importance of advancing quality health data, health financing for innovation and supply chain resilience to improve healthcare outcomes.\n\nParticipating in global convenings to advance healthcare systems: Leaders from across Johnson & Johnson participated in several key events and meetings during the UN General Assembly in 2022. Our engagement emphasized the importance of advancing equitable access to care, investing in health workers and innovation to eradicate pandemic and epidemic diseases, and pandemic response.\n\nAlso in 2022, global health leaders and stakeholders gathered in Geneva, Switzerland, for the 79th annual World Health Assembly (WHA), with representation of 194 country delegations. The WHA provides an important opportunity for partners across sectors to engage, build and strengthen relationships and to accelerate action on pressing health challenges facing the world. As a global healthcare leader, Johnson & Johnson was an active convenor and contributor to events during the WHA, providing a critical private sector lens and bringing greater awareness of our unique lab-to-last-mile approach to advancing equitable access to care. Our engagement covered key issues, including vaccination to our sector, and we believe this helps elevate ESG awareness and sets a benchmark for investor expectations of our industry.\n\nEngaging with industry on ESG: We continued to engage with the pharmaceutical industry to ensure the expertise of our industry is reflected in the ESG metrics and related disclosures that are most relevant to the sector. Working as part of the Biopharma Sustainability Roundtable (BSRT), a network that supports sustainability in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry, Johnson & Johnson participates in the Biopharma Investor ESG Communications Initiative, which supports the development of decision-useful communications about the sector\u2019s most important ESG issues. In 2022, BSRT released the Biopharma Investor ESG Communications Guidance 4.0, the result of collaboration among leading pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson & Johnson, as well as investor groups.\n\nAs a leading pharmaceutical company, we are always seeking to respond positively to investor information needs, as well as those of other stakeholders. We value the opportunity to collaborate with peer companies to define disclosure guidance specific to our sector, and we believe this helps elevate ESG awareness and sets a benchmark for investor expectations of our industry.\n\nEngaging stakeholders for this Report: Many internal stakeholders across Johnson & Johnson\u2019s global teams provided input for this Report. The Chairman of the Board and CEO, the Disclosure Committee and the Disclosure Sub-Committee reviewed the Report outline and metrics, and the Disclosure Committee reviewed the full Report. Our entire Executive Committee reviewed and approved the 2022 Health for Humanity Report, and it was shared with the Regulatory Compliance & Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors and the full Board prior to publication.\nHealth for Humanity 2025 Goals\n\nOur ambitious set of Health for Humanity 2025 Goals align to our ESG focus areas and foundation of accountability and innovation, and is how we hold ourselves publicly accountable in creating a more sustainable society. We measure and track performance against our Goals, with progress assured by a third party. Through our Health for Humanity 2025 Goals, we support 11 of the 17 UN SDGs.\n\nScorecard At-A-Glance\n\n| Goal | Key Performance Indicator | Target | 2022 Status |\n|------|---------------------------|--------|-------------|\n| Global health equity | % of identified assets from Johnson & Johnson Global Public Health and Janssen Infectious Diseases & Vaccines R&D pipeline with global access plans in place by 2025. | 100% | On track |\n| Access to HIV Treatment | LAI Access Program in place in two RLS countries. | Two countries | On track |\n| Access to Tuberculosis (TB) Treatment | # of cumulative patients receiving access to bedaquiline molecule (branded and generic) globally from 2021 through to end of 2025. | 700,000 | On track |\n| Developing TB Treatment | Stringent regulatory authority approval of a new TB drug/ regimen that reduces treatment length and is at least as effective and safe as the current recommended treatment by 2030. | New TB drug/ regimen | On track |\n| Access to Schizophrenia Treatment | Complete a clinical study to demonstrate the health, economic and social value of using paliperidone palmitate LAI to treat schizophrenia in Rwanda by 2024. | Complete clinical study | On track |\n| Support Frontline Health Workers | # of nurses, midwives and community health workers reached globally. | 1,000,000 | Exceeded |\n| Reduce Burden of Obstetric Fistula | # of fistula repair surgeries (based on surgeries reported or product donated). | 10,000 | On track |\n| Preventive Viral Vaccine Capabilities | Create playbook including Documented Organizational Readiness for Pandemic Preparedness based on the demonstrated accelerated process for emergency use licensure submission of our COVID-19 vaccine. | Create playbook | On track |\n| Vaccination Monitoring Platform | Adoption of endorsed platform by at least two countries by 2025. | Two countries | On track |\n| Healthcare for Women | Three best-practice healthcare for women insights published. | Three | Exceeded |\n\nSee our Health for Humanity 2025 Goals Scorecard for full results.\nAbout This Report\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s 2022 Health for Humanity Report details our ESG progress and performance and should be reviewed in conjunction with disclosures on the ESG Policies & Positions page.\n\nData in this annual Report cover the period between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2022, unless otherwise indicated, and was published in June 2023.

For that to become a reality, people need to have access to affordable lifesaving and life-enhancing treatments in every corner of the world. This need is even more acute due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has severely disrupted essential health services, shortened life expectancy and exacerbated inequities in access to basic health services.9\n\nTwo billion people worldwide are unable to access essential medicines and healthcare services.9\n\nAccess to medicine is central to our global health equity strategy and is embedded in our Health for Humanity 2025 Goals across several explicit commitments. Our progress against these commitments is described in this Report and summarized in our Health for Humanity 2025 Goals Scorecard.\n\nMore than 180 million patients treated globally with a Janssen medicine in 2022\n\nNote: Patients treated represents the estimated number of people globally who were treated with a Janssen medicine in 2022, including patients reached through our VERMOX (mebendazole) donation program. This total excludes people vaccinated with our Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, which is reported separately. We estimated the number of patients treated by converting quantities of Janssen medicines into courses of therapy or total patient days of therapy per year and then converting those into numbers of people based on average utilization per patient.\n\nPatients taking multiple Janssen products may be counted as multiple patients in the total. Methodologies may vary by product type given the nature of the product and available data. Our estimated number of patients treated may be revised over time as we gain new information on patient usage or experience restatements in underlying data sources or changes in product portfolios.\n\nIn all that we do, we seek to enhance access to our innovative medicines, vaccines and medical technologies everywhere, especially for populations in resource-limited settings. We share our progress in making our medicines and technologies available to help combat specific diseases such as HIV, TB, Ebola and certain NTDs in the Pandemics & Epidemics section of this Report.\n\nTaking a lead in access to medicine\n\nOur progress in advancing access and innovating novel medicines was recognized by the Access to Medicine Foundation in its 2022 Access to Medicine Index (ATMI) in which Johnson & Johnson ranked second, rising from third in 2021.\n\nOur position among the top three companies worldwide on the ATMI for a sixth consecutive year reflects our decades of commitment to enhancing access to our medicines and strengthening healthcare systems. It is also a testament to our colleagues and partners around the world who endeavor every day to enable millions of people in almost 100 lower- and middle-income countries to benefit from our innovative medicines and technologies.\n\nJennifer Taubert\nExecutive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals, Johnson & Johnson\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s Current and Cumulative Accomplishments Recognized by the 2022 ATMI Include:\n\n2nd largest R&D Priority Pipeline with 64 projects addressing diseases such as HIV, TB and dengue and the 3rd largest overall R&D pipeline in scope for ATMI with 101 projects\n\n100% of access plans in place for eligible late-stage projects\u201440 projects in total\n\n3 Centers for Global Health Discovery to support research to address critical health challenges, including TB, AMR and dengue\n\nPhase 1 clinical study completed that evaluated a dengue-specific antiviral treatment and prophylactic use\n\n2.2 billion doses of our medicine VERMOX (mebendazole) to treat children infected with intestinal worms donated since 2006\n\n>586,000 courses of our medicine SIRTURO (bedaquiline) to treat multidrug-resistant TB delivered since 2014\n\n264,000 people vaccinated with our Ebola vaccine regimen\n\nDigital Public Good designation achieved for VXNAID, our vaccination monitoring platform\n\n10 initiatives addressing health systems strengthening and R&D capacity building were noted as meeting all Good Practice Standards\n\n9 initiatives addressing supply chain and manufacturing capacity building were noted as meeting all Good Practice Standards\n\n$100 million invested to help establish the $1 billion AMR Action Fund\n\n9 United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Sustainable Development, \u201cGoal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages,\u201d https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs/goal3, accessed February 2023. 10 Big Pharma, Access to Medicine Foundation, \u201cR&D-based pharma companies,\u201d https://accesstomedicinefoundation.org/sectors-and-research/big-pharma, accessed February 2023.\nMaking progress by design: We apply our Janssen Access and Pricing Principles across our entire pharmaceutical portfolio, planning for access early in the research phase. We work systematically for each asset in development to thoroughly understand the disease characteristics, patient burden of disease and product characteristics. In our access planning, we consider health system characteristics, access and affordability, applying a variety of approaches, including value-based pricing, equity-based tiered pricing and other access initiatives tailored to the disease and product, as we work with other stakeholders to enable patient access to medicines across a wide variety of health system characteristics and country ability and willingness to pay.\n\nJanssen, along with our Global Public Health organization, deploys a lab-to-last-mile approach to fight diseases such as HIV, TB and Ebola, driving targeted innovation and initiatives to overcome barriers to deliver access to our medicines, strengthen health systems and support frontline health workers.\n\nMedicine prequalification by the World Health Organization (WHO) is designed to ensure that medicines supplied by procurement agencies meet acceptable standards of quality, safety and efficacy. Eight Johnson & Johnson products have received prequalified listed status.\n\nAdvancing access in the U.S.: Equitable access strategies are important not only in LMICs, but also in higher-income countries that are home to vulnerable and under-resourced populations as well. With a focus on access in the U.S., in 2023, we published our seventh annual Janssen U.S. Transparency Report, sharing updates relating to our pricing of medicines, our R&D investments and patient support programs. Notable details include:\n\n- $33.9 billion paid in rebates, discounts and fees\n- (3.5%) average net price decline of Janssen medicines, declining for the sixth year in a row.\n\nAs a signatory to the Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) Guiding Principles on Access to Healthcare, we engage broadly across our industry to improve access for patients around the world. In 2022, we collaborated as a member of BSR\u2019s working group to develop the Access to Healthcare Ladder.\n\nAccess to treatment in the last mile: As part of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s commitment to advancing equitable access to medicines, we funded an innovative pilot study by the Infectious Diseases Institute in Uganda to assess the impact of medical drones in increasing access and improving community health disease management. The pilot study used a small, unmanned aircraft to deliver HIV treatments to the people of the Kalangala islands. As a result of this pilot project, researchers were able to quantify the effectiveness of medical drones\u2019 HIV drug delivery, which will help inform future efforts to scale drone technology to solve other last mile delivery challenges in Uganda and elsewhere.\n\nSupporting the patient advocacy community\n\nOur 2022 HEALTHEVOCIES leadership conference convened nearly 100 leading online patient advocates for three days of learning, sharing and debating on topics such as the impacts of culture on health, bridging change in the healthcare space and culturally inclusive marketing. This much-awaited event was the first in-person conference since before the COVID-19 pandemic and the eighth annual HEALTHEVOCIES conference since its inception in 2015. HEALTHEVOCIES is designed by and for online patient advocates, offering a safe space to deliver authentic content on the most pressing issues impacting patients. Approximately 50 Johnson & Johnson leaders attended the 2022 conference, demonstrating our keen commitment to understanding patient needs and empowering patient advocates to influence how we communicate with and to patients to improve patient experience.\n\nThe HEALTHEVOCIES community reaches a vast digital network of more than 800 advocates across nearly 100 health conditions with a collective reach of 17 million patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals.\n\nAdvocating for inclusive access\n\nThe HEALTHEVOCIES Diversity, Equity, Accessibility & Inclusion (DEAI) Task Force shapes health-equity-focused programming for patient advocates and Johnson & Johnson audiences, supported by close to 30,000 followers on social media. In 2022, HEALTHEVOCIES, with the support of the DEAI Task Force, published an Instagram Live series on transgender health, advocacy and allyship; generated educational social media campaigns around 12 awareness events throughout the year, including Juneteenth, Pride and Hispanic Heritage Month; issued public statements in support of the AAPI and LGBTQIA+ communities following violence against them in the U.S.; and participated in discussions on health equity with Johnson & Johnson leaders. Ongoing DEAI Task Force activities such as these add vital momentum to driving equitable change in healthcare and sustaining trust between patient communities and Johnson & Johnson teams, resulting in a stronger patient voice across our broad range of healthcare interventions.\n\nThere are few places in my life where I experience the diversity of backgrounds that I find at HEALTHEVOCIES. It\u2019s a great reminder that not everyone with a chronic health issue comes from the same ethnic background, region of the country, or socio-economic situation. Each health condition comes with unique symptoms, challenges, and treatments. When everyone chooses to embrace the diversity that we inevitably have, we create an accepting environment to tackle difficult issues.\n\nHoward Chang\nPsoriasis Advocate & former HEALTHEVOCIES Conference Advisor\n\nII WHO, \u201cMedicines/Finished Pharmaceutical Products,\u201d https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/content/prequalified-lists/medicines. 12 A two-dose Ebola vaccine regimen comprising ZABDENO (Ad26.ZEBOV) and Bavarian Nordic\u2019s MVA-BIA (MVA-BN-Filo). * Figures according to Janssen internal financial accounting.\nAdvancing Public Health\n\nFor decades, Johnson & Johnson has remained steadfast in our commitment to leadership in public health and health equity. Our strategy reflects a long-held belief that creating societal value goes hand in hand with generating long-term business value.\n\nWe champion health equity through initiatives that maximize value for all those we reach through our business in areas where we can have the greatest impact. Alongside increasing access to medicines, our ambitions to advance public health include:\n\n- Collaborations to address cross-cutting healthcare issues\n- Advancing global surgery capabilities\n- Developing new solutions to enhance access to quality mental healthcare\n- Delivering innovation for better eye health\n- Promoting initiatives to eliminate health inequities for people of color\n- Supporting frontline health workers\n- Helping communities in need\n\nOur GPH organization has a mission to develop relevant innovations that save lives, cure patients and prevent disease and make them available, affordable and accessible for the world\u2019s most vulnerable and under-resourced populations. Our Health for Humanity 2025 Goals underpin this mission and empower us to target our efforts to deliver improved health outcomes.\n\nJohnson & Johnson convenes collaborations across multiple dimensions to advance public health, whether this is to address global diseases that have a disproportionate impact or to strengthen healthcare systems. For example, in 2022, we joined with HCA Healthcare, a leading healthcare provider in the U.S., to address key industry issues such as improving health equity, enhancing nursing support and improving patient outcomes. Specifically, this collaboration encompasses the development of a program for early stage lung cancer detection for the Black community, initiatives to improve cardiovascular health and education, training and other resources to elevate and support nurses. Learn more \u2192\n\nAlso, in 2022, we joined several private sector organizations in pledging funding and support to end critical diseases and strengthen health systems as part of the Global Fund\u2019s Seventh Replenishment Conference. Global Fund is an international organization established to defeat HIV, TB and malaria and ensure a healthier, safer, more equitable future for all. Our new Global Fund contribution was in the form of a partnership with the Skoll Foundation to jointly provide $25 million as an anchor investment in a fund to accelerate the professionalization of community health workers.

As many as 5 billion people do not have access to quality surgical care\u2014closing this gap is critically important to advance global health equity.\n\nOf the 313 million surgical procedures undertaken worldwide each year, only 6% occur in the poorest countries, where more than a third of the world\u2019s population lives.\n\nEthicon surgical technologies, including advanced digital solutions and robotics\n\nDePuy Synthes orthopaedics, including joint reconstruction, trauma, spine, sports and robotics\n\nInterventional Solutions & Specialty Surgery neurovascular care; heart rhythm disorders; ear, nose and throat treatment; and breast reconstruction\n\nJohnson & Johnson Vision specialist eye healthcare, including the most advanced intraocular and contact lenses\n\nJ&J MedTech\u2019s Global Core Capabilities\n\nJohnson & Johnson is committed to elevating the standard of care in surgery by bringing insights, scale and new technologies to meet the needs of more people in communities with limited surgical capacity around the world. We deploy our global surgery capabilities together with our collaborators and aim to address healthcare inequities, expand patient access, improve outcomes and reduce health system costs. Our commitment to changing the trajectory of surgical care is encompassed in our Health for Humanity 2025 Goals, and we have made strong progress so far.\n\nAccelerating access to surgery: At the 75th World Health Assembly in May 2022, we launched our Global Surgery Initiative with the goal of advancing the entire continuum of surgical care\u2014from prevention to treatment to rehabilitation\u2014across two significant areas of unmet need, obstetric fistula and long bone fracture. We announced the beginning of pilot programs in these two areas in Kenya and Malawi, working with government, academic and NGOs to strengthen surgical systems. Combining the strengths and expertise of Johnson & Johnson with global and local collaborators, we aim to accelerate access by streamlining supply chains, reducing costs and better equipping surgeons and health systems to meet the needs of the patients and communities they serve.\n\n8,800 obstetric fistula repair surgeries supported through Johnson & Johnson\u2019s suture donation program over two years (2021 \u2013 2022)\n\nImproving surgical instruments for obstetric fistula repair surgery: Obstetric fistula is a serious childbirth complication that is preventable with improved practices and treatable with access to surgical care. Johnson & Johnson helps to improve care by developing and providing access to improved surgical instruments: fistula scissors, bladder sounds and suture/catheter organizers. These improvements aim to provide high-quality instrumentation to increase patient comfort, maximize surgeon visibility and improve safety for both the patient and the surgeon. We work with expert collaborators to help train surgeons and frontline health workers on the effective use of these instruments. In 2021, for example, we trialed the new surgical instruments at the Freedom from Fistula Hospital in Sierra Leone in collaboration with Dr. Rachel Pope, Associate Professor, Urology Institute, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center.\n\nIn 2022, we progressed to further trials of these instruments in Kenya, where more than 1,000 new cases of obstetric fistula are recorded each year. As part of our ongoing program, we seek feedback from surgeons to inform future innovation and help scale surgical capacity countrywide to reach even more women suffering from obstetric fistula.\n\nJohnson & Johnson was one of the first companies to partner with Dr. Catherine Hamlin at the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital in Ethiopia, beginning in the 1980s, with the donation of sutures for fistula surgeries.\n\nElizabeth, a 21-year-old woman from Kenya, received fistula surgery at the Gynocare Women\u2019s and Fistula Hospital, the flagship facility of the Fistula Foundation Treatment Network in Kenya that Johnson & Johnson supports with donated surgical products.

Together with Direct Relief, we delivered our sutures and new instruments to nine hospitals in the Kenya Fistula Treatment Network. Working with these improved instruments and supported by training, surgeons were able to perform safe obstetric fistula repairs for more than 1,300 women in Kenya in 2022.\n\nBetween 50,000 and 100,000 women each year suffer from obstetric fistula.16\n\nIn 2022, we also continued to support ongoing obstetric fistula education for surgeons through our nearly 30-year collaboration with Mercy Ships, the largest non-governmental fleet of hospital ships in the world. Our support has helped hundreds of surgeons and operating room specialists receive advanced training by collaborating to design essential skills training and provide hygiene kits and surgical products.\n\nImproving access to care for long bone fracture: Left untreated, long bone fractures, a crack or break in the tibia or another long bone, can result in long-term disability. Johnson & Johnson is working in Malawi to help train surgeons with novel tools and techniques and strengthen supply chains to improve sustainable access to surgical trauma care for people in need. In 2022, supported by the Johnson & Johnson Foundation, we launched our Long Bone Fracture Pilot Program in Malawi, introducing novel devices, strengthening supply chains, training district-level providers to complete procedures and elevating operating room processes for a better patient and care team experience. Our aim is to scale this initiative to other LMICs, building on our experience in Malawi.\n\nHealth for Humanity 2025 Goals\n\nProgress in Reducing Burden of Obstetric Fistula\n\n- In 2022, supported delivery of 5,600 obstetric fistula repair surgeries for a cumulative total of 8,800 since the beginning of 2021.\n- New surgical instruments piloted in Sierra Leone in 2021 and expanded to Kenya in 2022 to increase patient comfort, maximize surgeon visibility and improve safety for the patient and surgeon.\n- Continued support of healthcare workers through Fistula Foundation.\n\n16 WHO, \u201cObstetric fistula,\u201d https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/10-facts-on-obstetric-fistula, accessed February 2023.\nMental Healthcare\n\nMental illness continues to be one of the greatest unmet needs in healthcare. This was intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, protracted conflict and growing social inequities around the world threaten to further exacerbate mental healthcare hardships while challenging the availability of resources to address them.\n\nNowhere is this truer than for vulnerable communities in several parts of the world; more than 80% of all people with mental disorders live in LMICs and many receive no care at all due to a lack of treatment options, few trained mental health workers and associated stigma, among other reasons.\n\nLevels of public expenditure on mental health are low (global median of 2.1% of government health expenditure) and particularly meager in LMICs.\n\nOver the last half century, we have developed several innovative treatments for conditions impacting the brain and central nervous system. Building on this legacy, we have expanded access to mental healthcare through innovation, research and programs that empower frontline health workers to better manage mental illness.\n\nImproving access to quality mental healthcare in Rwanda: Our five-year collaboration with the Rwanda Ministry of Health, starting in 2017, achieved major progress in creating a framework for quality, accessible mental healthcare in the country, including:\n\n- supporting the training of more than 50,000 community health workers and general practitioner nurses on the signs and symptoms of mental illness, including through a unique, phone-based training program;\n- conducting the first National Mental Health Survey in Rwanda, one of the most extensive nationwide surveys completed in sub-Saharan Africa to date, which was published in 2022 in the open access, peer-reviewed BMC Public Health Journal; and\n- making available second-generation antipsychotics, including oral risperidone and paliperidone palmitate long-acting injectables (PPLAI) (through our clinical study).\n\nEvaluating treatment in real-world healthcare settings: In 2022, we continued our Clinical Study to Assess the Treatment of Schizophrenia With Paliperidone Palmitate in Rwandan Healthcare Settings (CASPAR), designed to assess the impact of PPLAI in patients with schizophrenia in real-world healthcare settings. By the end of 2022, 100% of patients were screened and nearly 50% of patients moved to the treatment phase. The study also includes clinical research training for the local principal investigators at the five study sites in Rwanda, as well as site visits from the Johnson & Johnson research team. CASPAR represents an important step forward in generating evidence that could inform adoption of PPLAI as a treatment option for schizophrenia.\n\nMental Healthcare\n\nLevels of public expenditure on mental health are low (global median of 2.1% of government health expenditure) and particularly meager in LMICs.\n\n17 WHO, \u201cWorld mental health report: Transforming mental health for all,\u201d https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240049338, accessed February 2023. 18 WHO, \u201cMental Health Atlas 2020,\u201d https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240036703, accessed February 2023.\nVision\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, sight is the most dominant of the five senses and plays a crucial role in every facet of our lives. But unmet needs in eye health continue to affect people the world over and especially the most vulnerable and under-resourced populations.\n\nWorldwide, more than 2.2 billion people are visually impaired, and more than 1 billion are forced to live with preventable or treatable conditions because they cannot get the care they need. At Johnson & Johnson Vision, part of J&J MedTech, we have a bold ambition to change the trajectory of eye health worldwide. We deliver innovation that enables eye care professionals to create better outcomes for patients throughout their lives, and we collaborate to expand access to quality eye care in communities with the greatest need.\n\nImproving vision in a digital world: With adults spending 35% more time on digital devices in a post-pandemic world\u201413 or more hours per day according to estimates\u2014the strain on eye health is noticeable. With eyes locked on a screen for long periods, people blink less; this has a destabilizing effect on the tear film, causing dryness and discomfort. Following feedback from eye care professionals and patients we\u2019ve worked to help meet the needs of digitally intensive lifestyles through increased education and the launch of a new contact lens ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-DAY to help reduce light scatter and block UVA and UVB rays.\n\nCataracts are one of the leading causes of preventable blindness worldwide, impacting almost 100 million people globally.\n\nSeeing better in low-light conditions: Presbyopia, in simple terms, is an age-related condition that reduces the ability of near vision, projected to affect 2.1 billion people globally in 2030. To provide relief for the many people whose quality of life is reduced by presbyopia, Johnson & Johnson Vision introduced our next-generation presbyopia-correcting intraocular lens (PC-IOL) TECNIS SYMPHY OPTIBLUE IOL in the U.S. and select countries in EMEA in 2022. Using this high-performance technology, eye care professionals can offer patients a full range of high-quality continuous vision in all lighting conditions.\n\nHalf of the world\u2019s population is projected to be myopic by 2050 with nearly one billion people expected to have high myopia.\n\nAdvancing eye health digital innovation in Asia Pacific: In 2022, Johnson & Johnson Vision signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) to jointly establish an Eye Health Digital Innovation Consortium in Singapore. Hosted at A*STAR\u2019s Institute of High Performance Computing, the consortium focuses on advancing eye health research in the Asia Pacific region. A joint investment of SGD 15 million from both organizations will be channeled into the consortium over the course of three years. As the first of its kind in the region, the consortium will initially focus on the following:\n\n- improving eye healthcare delivery from eye care professionals to patients in Singapore and beyond;\n- optimizing collaboration between the private and public sector to enhance eye healthcare delivery; and\n- developing new technological processes to support enterprises that are directly involved in primary eye healthcare delivery.\n\nThe prevalence of distance vision impairment in low- and middle-income regions is estimated to be four times higher than in high-income regions.\n\nThere is a high prevalence of eye disorders among Singapore\u2019s population, and this is a cause for concern. Open innovation and public-private partnerships will pave the way for us to leverage strengths from different parties and develop solutions to address this complex healthcare challenge.\n\nPeter Menziuso\nCompany Group Chairman, Johnson & Johnson Vision\n\nProfessor Tan Sze Wee\nAssistant Chief Executive, Enterprise, A*STAR\nSlowing myopia progression in children: Myopia, sometimes called nearsightedness, is a chronic and progressive disease that can lead to sight-threatening complications over time. Children under 12 who are diagnosed with myopia are at a greater risk of developing high myopia in later life. Among the first in the industry to recognize the importance of myopia management, following decades of research to develop scientifically proven solutions, Johnson & Johnson Vision launched ACUVUE ABILITI to address the prevalence and progression of myopia in children. ABILITI is designed to fit seamlessly into the lifestyle of parents and children.\n\nIn 2022, we launched ABILITI 1-DAY and ABILITI OVERNIGHT in Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore. We also received FDA approval of lens parameter expansion for ABILITI OVERNIGHT to extend the reach for patients in the U.S. With these developments, more patients in more parts of the world can now enjoy better vision throughout their lifetimes.\n\nBringing critical eye care to children: Sight for Kids (SFK) was founded in 2002 by Johnson & Johnson Vision and Lions Clubs International Foundation and has administered free, volunteer-directed vision screenings to more than 42 million children in five countries, including India, Kenya, the Philippines, Thailand and the U.S. Today, as SFK celebrates 20 years of bringing critical eye care to children in under-resourced communities, it is the largest-known program of its kind in the world.\n\nIn 2022, in the U.S., SFK expanded beyond the South Florida region to a second location by teaming up with the Louisiana Lions Eye Foundation to provide free statewide eye care to Louisiana\u2019s youth. A vision screening event and tours of the mobile screening unit marked this new activity.\n\nHealthy sight is critical to a child\u2019s academic performance, self-esteem and overall well-being. By helping their vision through Sight For Kids, we can make a meaningful impact now that will carry into the future, from their studies to their career.\n\nDr. Freddy T. Simon\nOphthalmologist, Kerala, India\n\nCelebrating World Sight Day 2022: Johnson & Johnson Vision selected World Sight Day to share its Vision for Good 2021 Impact Review, with additional examples of how we are helping change the trajectory of eye health while operating in an environmentally sustainable manner.\n\nLearn more about social responsibility at Johnson & Johnson Vision.\nOur Race to Health Equity\n\nAt the heart of Johnson & Johnson's commitment to health equity is our desire to create a world where the color of your skin does not determine your access to care, quality of care or health outcomes. Launched in 2020, Our Race to Health Equity (ORTHE) is our $100 million, enterprise-wide initiative focused on closing the racial health gap in the U.S.\n\nThe Johnson & Johnson ORTHE initiative focuses on eradicating racial and social injustice as a public health threat by eliminating health inequities for people of color in the U.S. We are committed to closing the racial health gap by investing in culturally competent community care models that create healthy outcomes for people of color.\n\nBy the end of 2022, we had committed more than $52 million to advance ORTHE programs in the following areas:\n\n- **Community Health Capacity Building**\n  - Expanding access to affordable, community-centric care through investments in community health centers, community health workers and other care model innovations.\n\n- **Inclusive Research and Representative Clinical Trials**\n  - Increasing access to clinical trials through diverse site selection and patient recruitment, as well as incorporating equity into end-to-end therapy and device design.\n\n- **Community Engagement and Education**\n  - Empowering patients and end users with tools, resources and community-based services to \"own\" their health and increase health literacy.\n\n- **Culturally Competent Care**\n  - Increasing the racial and ethnic diversity of the healthcare talent pipeline and workforce and promoting an equitable point of care experience for BIPOC patients.\n\nPeople of color in the U.S. face higher incidences of, and death rates from, conditions such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes and COVID-19.10\n\n**Community health capacity building**\n\nThree programs helped to expand access to affordable, community-centric care.\n\nCommunity health workers in Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee benefited from a health worker network collaborative grant that we contributed to establishing alongside management skills training of executive directors and leaders of community-based healthcare organizations. Working in partnership with many organizations, we aim to help build trust between under-resourced communities and health systems, backed by our commitment to supporting 200,000 HCPs and researchers by 2025.\n\nBy the end of 2022, 307,000 U.S. HCPs and researchers were provided development and support to help create more equitable healthcare systems.\n\nWe also launched a new initiative to support climate resilience at community healthcare clinics in the U.S. that serve people with limited access to care in communities most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Through a collaboration with Americares and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health\u2019s Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment (Harvard Chan C-CHANGE), we aim to bolster operational resilience in clinics, as well as the resilience of healthcare workers, to help minimize disruptions caused by extreme weather events. The goal is to support 100 medical clinics across the U.S. by 2025.

The Challenge called on local entrepreneurs in Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York and Philadelphia to deliver locally inspired, innovative approaches to advance health equity. Engaging credible community leaders who understood local health challenges, the independent selection committee chose 14 winners from more than 180 applicants. The winners included community organizations that provide services, including free healthcare to under-resourced neighborhoods; improving birth and maternal health outcomes for Black families; and providing youth, educators and communities with programs designed to support mental wellness and equity. Each winner was awarded seed funding from a pool of more than $1 million, along with mentorship from renowned entrepreneurs and public health experts and access to the JLABS ecosystem. Following the Challenge, many of these organizations have continued to positively impact their communities and are actively expanding. Learn more \u2192\n\n**Community engagement and education**\n\nThree innovative programs continued under the ORTHE umbrella, helping people be more informed about options to prioritize healthcare and treatment. My Health Can\u2019t Wait is an educational effort and resource hub created by J&J MedTech to inspire people to get the information they need to pursue care with confidence, especially after the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic that caused many Americans to delay healthcare treatment. Learn more \u2192\n\nThrough J&J MedTech\u2019s Signature Equity Program, we are identifying communities across the U.S. where we can help deliver the most impact, forming partnerships with community-based organizations and offering Johnson & Johnson resources and expertise to help meet community healthcare needs. In 2022, J&J MedTech and Janssen helped provide free health education and access to health screenings to thousands of community members at events in Atlanta; Chicago; Columbia, South Carolina; and Los Angeles, and the plan is to expand to other populations around the world in 2023.\nSave Legs, Change Lives is a multiyear initiative by Janssen to address the hidden threat of peripheral artery disease (PAD)-related amputation. Black Americans with PAD have up to four times higher risk of amputation than white Americans.26 Janssen collaborated with leading professional associations, including the American College of Cardiology, as well as healthcare systems and community organizations to raise awareness of PAD-related issues and facilitate equitable access to treatment. Through 2022, Janssen continued to share PAD information widely, implemented thousands of free screenings and advanced research to help overcome PAD-related health inequities.\n\nCulturally competent care\n\nIn line with our goal to promote better care for people of color by addressing unconscious bias in healthcare, we co-launched a cross-sector partnership initiative, Unconscious Bias and Disparities in Healthcare: A Call to Action, with a Continuing Medical Education program at its core. The program targets HCPs in communities of color and assists them to enact changes in their daily practice to improve patient care and outcomes. Additionally, we maintained our sponsorship of the Alliance for Inclusion in Medicine Scholarship Program, a scholarship and mentorship commitment launched in 2021 with National Medical Fellowships (NMF) and the Alliance for Inclusion in Medicine (AIM). Between 2021 and 2022, we welcomed two cohorts of underrepresented medical students\u201440 in total\u2014to the program and have committed over $2 million in scholarship funding across both cohorts. With support from Johnson & Johnson, NMF welcomed an inaugural cohort of 20 underrepresented medical students and selected a second cohort of second- and third-year medical school scholars. AIM scholars were paired with a Johnson & Johnson mentor to provide guidance and insight as these young scholars embark on their medical career journey. Learn more \u2192\n\nAdditionally, in 2022, we expanded our pioneering Climate and Health Equity Fellowship, which was created with the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health and the National Medical Association to support physicians of color to become leaders in climate and health equity education, advocacy and policy solutions. Our increased contribution for the second class of Fellows supported 15 physicians from across the U.S., representing diverse specialties, advocacy experiences, cultural backgrounds and interests in climate and health, enhancing their leadership capabilities as medical professionals in caring for patients and for our planet. Watch video \u2192\n\nInclusive research and representative clinical trials\n\nWe advance multiple initiatives to enhance the diversity of healthcare across several dimensions that include Johnson & Johnson R&D and outreach to community representatives and advocates. One example is Research Includes Me, an initiative of Janssen that is a community-focused campaign designed to create awareness and engagement within Black and Brown communities to elevate the discussion around clinical trials. The campaign helps build trust-based relationships with communities to provide clinical trial information and hosts an educational website to provide underrepresented patients with greater access to information and resources about clinical trial research. Learn more \u2192\n\nLearn more about Our Race to Health Equity.\nFrontline Healthcare & Communities\n\nIn line with our commitment to advancing public health, we invest extensively in raising the quality of health and well-being in the communities in which we live and work.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s Global Community Impact (GCI) organization\u2014with funding from Johnson & Johnson Foundation, the Corporation and operating companies across the Johnson & Johnson Family of Companies\u2014drives our community-giving initiatives around the world. Aligned with our ESG strategy, and our Health for Humanity 2025 Goals, as well as driving our ORTHE initiative, GCI specifically advances initiatives at the front line of healthcare with an ambitious public goal.\n\nIn 2022, the Center advanced several initiatives, including:\n\nSupporting community health workers across Africa: A professionalized workforce of community health workers, who engage daily with communities, is key to responding to disease outbreaks and making gains on longstanding global health priorities, including universal health coverage. The Africa Frontline First Catalytic Fund (AFF-CF) was launched in 2022 to support community health workers in 10 African countries with a $15 million commitment by the Johnson & Johnson Foundation and a $10 million commitment by the Skoll Foundation. These investments will be matched by The Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria. The AFF-CF will help accelerate progress and improve healthcare delivered at the community level, as well as ensure the women, who make up the large proportion of community health workers, are properly paid for their work. The Fund aims to triple the number of salaried community health workers in sub-Saharan Africa, expanding coverage to 100 million people by 2030.\n\nSupporting frontline health workers\n\nWe believe that if we solve the challenges facing frontline health workers, we will improve healthcare for everyone. The Johnson & Johnson Center for Health Worker Innovation (\u201cthe Center\u201d), established in 2019, is tasked with guiding our $250 million commitment to support frontline health workers, with a goal of supporting one million nurses, midwives and community health workers by 2030. Although we exceeded our one million goal in 2022, well in advance of our plan, we continue the work of the Center to provide critically needed support for community health workers.\n\nSupporting community health workers in 2022, supporting over 1,300,000 frontline health workers in cumulative total.\n\nHealth for Humanity 2025 Goals\n\nProgress in Supporting Frontline Health Workers (by 2030)\n\n- Reached more than 570,000 nurses, midwives and community health workers in 2022, supporting over 1,300,000 frontline health workers in cumulative total.\n\nStrengthening community-based health systems: The Center helped establish a Community Health Worker Think Tank, led by South Africa\u2019s National Department of Health, to address critical gaps facing community health worker policy implementation and community-level service delivery. In Nigeria, the Center collaborated widely internally and externally to help create a roadmap of partnership opportunities to strengthen the nursing and midwifery workforce in Nigeria with an emphasis on mental health, oncology, and maternal and newborn health. Also, the Center launched Basecamp for Health System Transformation with the School of System Change, a pilot program to nurture system change practitioners to build community health system capacity across Europe and sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nHarnessing the power of data: To support frontline health workers in making trusted, data-driven decisions, the Center supported several thousand hours of pro bono data science services in sub-Saharan Africa and leveraged data sets of millions of health encounters generated by more than 4,000 community health workers to improve data quality and inform best practices. The Center is collaborating with DataKind and community-based organizations to champion data collection practices that will enable health systems stakeholders to make healthcare delivery decisions backed by trusted data.\n\nHelping health workers manage stress: To support health workers in managing stress, exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, The Resilience Collaborative, the Center\u2019s global learning community launched in 2021, grew to more than 600 members in 2022. Open-source resources, now including Spanish, Portuguese and Hindi translations, are being accessed by more than 300 organizations in 38 countries and assisting in raising awareness about ways to implement and evaluate evidence-based programs for improved health worker resilience and well-being.\n\nLauren Moore\nVice President, Global Community Impact, Johnson & Johnson\nSupporting supply chain training for health workers in Africa: Johnson & Johnson provided funding to Empower School of Health to develop a free, online supply chain training curriculum that aims to help frontline health workers understand their role in the supply chain and delivery of essential medicines and treatments. Empower School of Health delivered this training with the East, Central and Southern African College of Nursing and the Eucmenical Pharmaceutical Network. After a successful pilot in Botswana and Kenya in 2022, the curriculum is currently being rolled out in three additional countries in 2023: Nigeria, Rwanda and South Africa.\n\nEnhancing HCP education around the world: J&J MedTech partnered with Advances in Surgery and other industry associations to provide more than 1 million HCPs with online webinars across a range of topics and specialties. For example, a DEI series of 12 webinars was dedicated to discussing workplace challenges and best practices, and a Resilient Resident Series of 14 webinars targeted leading surgeons in their early career. Overall, the suite of webinar series attracted more HCPs in 147 countries across more than 70 events.\n\nEthicon reignited its partnership with the Society of Black Academic Surgeons by expanding the Diverse Surgeons Initiative (DSI), a program focused on equipping minority surgical residents for fellowship attainment and faculty appointment. The DSI supported clinical and technical training and mentorship for 14 surgical residents and will continue into 2023 to help them realize their potential as future surgical fellows and faculty leaders. Of DSI participants from prior cohorts, 87% completed subspecialty fellowships and 41% obtained faculty positions following the next five years of their careers.\n\nChampioning nurses\n\nJohnson & Johnson has proudly championed the nursing profession for more than a century. With innovative mindsets, invaluable insights and hands-on experience, nurses make healthcare systems work: When we work together to support nurses, we are advancing better healthcare for all. Our goal is to work with like-minded partners to attract and strengthen a thriving, innovative and diverse nursing workforce, empowered to advance health equity and transform healthcare. We support and empower nurses through advocacy, scholarships, clinical and leadership education, events that teach and hone healthcare innovation skill sets, mental health resources and more.\n\nOur work includes advocating for the fundamental value of the nursing profession, catalyzing a workplace culture and environment where nurses can thrive and strengthening diversity in nursing. We bring greater awareness to the extraordinary impact that nurses have in healthcare through key activities and programs, including TV and social media advertising, storytelling on our \u201cSee You Now\u201d podcast and through Notes on Nursing. We are working to spark interest in the profession among diverse, prospective nursing students through a new series called The Future of Nursing is Me. Learn more \u2192\n\nWe also support events like NurseHack4Health that support nurse-led innovation in healthcare. Working in collaboration with SONSIEL and Microsoft, we launched our first Pitch-A-Thon to elevate and foster nurse-led ideas for redesigning a healthy work environment where the workforce can thrive. Nearly 40 nurse-led, interdisciplinary health systems applied to the Pitch-A-Thon, and 10 were selected as finalists. Representing the transformative power of nurse-led innovation, three teams were awarded $260,000 in grant funding to bring their solutions to life. Learn more \u2192\n\nAccelerating health equity entrepreneurship\n\nJohnson & Johnson Impact Ventures (JJIV) is a $50 million impact fund within the Johnson & Johnson Foundation that invests in healthcare companies and entrepreneurs with innovative business models to improve health equity and access to affordable and quality care for under-resourced patients around the world. Financial returns from portfolio companies are reinvested, enabling further expansion of the fund\u2019s impact. JJIV also leverages Johnson & Johnson\u2019s network of experience and expertise in healthcare to provide resources, support and guidance to its portfolio companies. Learn more \u2192\n\nProgress was made in 2022, with new investments and approximately half of the $50 million fund having now been committed to companies across five continents. Since joining the portfolio, these companies have reached 2.8 million patients directly and supported more than 61,000 HCPs.\n\nSupporting the field: Fueled by the belief in the potential of market-based solutions to address health equity issues, JJIV provided funding to early stage health impact entrepreneurs to develop their ideas through various external partnerships and programs. JJIV also provided funding for Rock Health\u2019s Equitable Investments Initiative to further research and publish a call-to-action report for greater investment in underrepresented entrepreneurs in the U.S. Additionally, JJIV helped fund the development of IRIS+, an investment tool from the Global Impact Investing Network to assist investors to identify and support enterprises combating racial health disparities.\n\n2022 was a milestone year for JJIV, with a first return on investment from Patients Know Best, a personal health record company that is helping to give patients control of their own medical information.\nOur giving\n\nAs the largest, most diversified healthcare products company, Johnson & Johnson is an essential part of the fabric of society in communities around the globe. We care deeply about the well-being of our communities, and we use our reach and share our resources with communities around the world, through collaborations and partnerships, to forge a healthier, more equitable future for all.

The significant increase in our giving was attributed to product donations to JJPAF.\n\nOur community giving can be categorized into three channels:\n\nFoundation: The Johnson & Johnson Foundation is a registered charitable organization that is funded solely by the Johnson & Johnson Family of Companies. The Foundation operates worldwide as Johnson & Johnson Foundation United States (founded 1953) and Johnson & Johnson Foundation Scotland (founded 2007). These independent entities support region-specific and global partnerships and initiatives, employee volunteering and disaster response activities. Specific initiatives supported by the Foundation mentioned in this Report include the Center for Health Worker Innovation and Johnson & Johnson Impact Ventures.\n\nEnterprise: Across Johnson & Johnson, both at the Enterprise level and through our operating companies in more than 60 countries of the world, we donate funds and products to regional or local causes aligned with Our Credo, Our Purpose and specific needs in local communities, including disaster relief. These donations are at the discretion of local Johnson & Johnson leaders and globally amount to hundreds of millions of dollars each year.\n\nPatient Assistance: In the U.S., we support independent initiatives by donating medicines and funding to the Johnson & Johnson Patient Assistance Foundation, Inc. (JJPAF), an independent nonprofit that helps eligible patients without insurance coverage receive prescription products donated by Johnson & Johnson operating companies.\n\nDisaster preparedness & relief\n\nWe continue to work with trusted partners, includingAmericares, Heart to Heart International, the Catholic Medical Mission Board, MAP International, MedShare and International Health Partners, on the front lines of care by coordinating product donations and supporting programs that help communities recover, rebuild and become resilient. In the immediate aftermath of major disasters, we provide essential Pharmaceutical, MedTech and Consumer Health products, as well as monetary donations and other support.\n\nIn 2022, building on a 15-year collaboration, Johnson & Johnson and International Health Partners (IHP) debuted a shared global donation platform that harnesses best practices and scale to help communities in crisis recover, rebuild and regain resilience after disasters. The technology behind this unified global system for product donation will be extended to all Johnson & Johnson\u2019s and IHP\u2019s approved product donations partners. By offering increased visibility and alignment, as well as a streamlined, automated approvals system, this innovative technology is improving the speed of product donations across geographies.\n\nExamples of our support for communities struck by disaster or humanitarian crises in 2022 include:\n\n- **War in Ukraine:** We contributed more than $32 million overall to relief efforts, including cash and product donations in compliance with current international sanctions. Our donations included both humanitarian support for refugees with a combined $10 million to the International Rescue Committee and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent, as well as products valued at more than $22 million, including medical devices, essential medicines and consumer health products such as first-aid and feminine-hygiene products.\n\n- **Hurricanes Fiona and Ian:** We partnered withAmericas and Gulf Coast Community Foundation to address immediate needs and restore health services in areas affected by Hurricane Ian in central Florida and Hurricane Fiona in Puerto Rico.\n\n- **Volcano in Tonga:** We worked with UNICEF to address the needs of children and caregivers, following the eruption of the underwater volcano Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha\u2019apai, which blanketed the majority of Tonga with volcanic ash, affecting nearly 80% of Tonga\u2019s population and displacing more than 1,525 people, including more than 500 children.\n\n- **Flooding in Kentucky:** We joined withAmericas in the aftermath of the devastating flooding that struck southeastern Kentucky to help restore health services at three clinics and support people displaced from their homes.\n\n- **Earthquake in Indonesia:** Following the earthquake that struck West Java, Indonesia, displacing more than 100,000 people, we provided, together with Project Hope, 10 community-managed latrines with water tanks in two villages offering access to clean water and sanitation facilities.\nPandemics & Epidemics\n\nThe United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 urges us all to work toward ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all ages, with a specific target to end epidemics, including HIV, tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases by 2030. Vaccine protection against, and treatments for, pandemic and epidemic diseases are critical to achieving this goal worldwide.\n\nProviding access to and progressing the development of effective treatments and vaccines to combat some of the world\u2019s deadliest diseases has long been a global public health priority for Johnson & Johnson and an important part of our global health equity strategy. We have amassed more than a century of experience in advancing novel treatment regimens and vaccines and facilitating access to address multiple diseases, including HIV, TB, COVID-19, Ebola and dengue, as well as addressing the growing threat of AMR.\n\nOur approach envisions creating a robust health ecosystem to advance the availability and affordability of needed medicines and vaccines and facilitating access for all, including the world\u2019s most vulnerable populations. Efficacious management of vaccine administration, especially to combat urgent outbreaks of disease such as Ebola, can have a transformational impact on public health. Expanding the use of our vaccination monitoring platform (VXNAID), one of our Health for Humanity 2025 Goals, is a crucial step in advancing large-scale immunization to protect people and save lives around the world.\n\nEnabling access to our vaccination monitoring platform\n\nWe developed VXNAID, a vaccine-agnostic digital platform that supports adherent vaccine administration in the framework of clinical studies or campaigns. VXNAID is a digital tool that integrates innovative technologies to improve patient tracing, data management and communication to implement impactful vaccination campaigns in resource-limited settings.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2021, the platform was deployed in a large-scale Ebola vaccination campaign\u2014called UMURINZI\u2014in collaboration with the Government of Rwanda. UMURINZI was the first large use case of the platform and fully vaccinated more than 203,000 Rwandans against Ebola with the Johnson & Johnson Ebola vaccine regimen, comprising ZABDENO (Ad26.ZEBOV) and Bavarian Nordic\u2019s MVABEA (MVA-BN-Filo).\n\nIn 2022, VXNAID was optimized based on the UMURINZI campaign and the second-generation platform shared as an open-source code, enabling global/open access to the platform for any vaccination program.\n\nFor all of us at Johnson & Johnson, Our Credo inspires us to be \u201cresponsible to the communities in which we live and work and to the world community as well.\u201d This is a core tenet of our approach to global health security, as we aim to stop the spread of life-threatening diseases that have the potential to wipe out entire communities if unchecked. We have never been more determined to advance our plans to safeguard people against the threat of pandemics and epidemics.\n\nVanessa Broadhurst\nExecutive Vice President, Global Corporate Affairs, Johnson & Johnson\n\nOur approach envisions creating a robust health ecosystem to advance the availability and affordability of needed medicines and vaccines and facilitating access for all, including the world\u2019s most vulnerable populations. Efficacious management of vaccine administration, especially to combat urgent outbreaks of disease such as Ebola,\nIn 2021, VXNAID was adopted by the WHO for use in its Solidarity Trial Vaccines (STV), an international, multi-vaccine clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines. The use of the platform in the STV program was acknowledged by the WHO in a public statement. In 2022, VXNAID was further deployed in the STV program and expanded to other countries.\n\nVXNAID has been shared as an open-source code, enabling global and open access for any vaccination program.\n\nTo learn more about VXNAID in practice: Watch video\n\nInvesting in research where it is needed most\n\nJohnson & Johnson is committed to addressing the dual gap in innovation and health equity through the establishment of the J&J Centers for Global Health Discovery. In joining forces with academic institutions, leveraging regional networks and growing in scope, the Centers provide long-term opportunities to support talent in the discovery sciences and hopefully speed up the discovery of novel mechanisms to tackle expanding and emerging challenges in global health.\n\nFollowing the inaugural J&J Satellite Center for Global Health Discovery launch in 2021 at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, aimed at developing the next generation of drug regimens needed to treat all forms of TB, we opened two more Satellite Centers in 2022:\n\nSouth Africa: The Satellite Center for Global Health Discovery at the Holistic Drug Discovery and Development (H3D) Centre, University of Cape Town, focuses on outpacing the rising threat of AMR.

The meeting examined ways to incentivize and manage partnerships between the federal government and industry, academia and NGOs to drive technology innovation and improve biological intelligence for current and future threats. Three BLUE KNIGHT companies presented their next-generation preparedness solutions at the meeting, the first time that early stage companies were invited to speak to the Commission, showcasing the power of public-private partnerships to accelerate scientific and technological advancements.\n\nOur COVID-19 vaccine\n\nActing with urgency at the onset of COVID-19, Johnson & Johnson galvanized resources to help halt the pandemic through developing an easy-to-deploy vaccine, obtaining regulatory authorizations, building supply chain capabilities and engaging with partners around the world to support health systems and healthcare providers involved in combating COVID-19. From the beginning, we identified new and impactful ways to optimize clinical trials, reach diverse communities and ensure appropriate representation from all populations in our research.\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine received multiple regulatory authorizations, emergency use waivers and import permits in many countries worldwide, including 50 countries in Africa.\n\n>268 million\n\nJohnson & Johnson delivered more than 268 million COVID-19 vaccines in 2022, with more than 85% launch-to-date shipped to LMICs.\n\nFor more information related to our COVID-19 vaccine, see our 2022 Annual Report.\nHIV\n\nAt Johnson & Johnson, we have been committed to fighting HIV for decades. Together, we are helping to advance science, enable access and collaborate to improve lives around the world in a determined effort to make HIV history.\n\nThough there have been significant advances in prevention since the beginning of the global epidemic, 1.5 million people acquired HIV in 2021 alone, underscoring the high unmet need for new options. That\u2019s why we must continue to drive out inequalities in access to HIV treatment while making HIV treatment easier, more effective and more available for everyone.\n\nWe remain focused on helping transform HIV from a terminal illness into a manageable condition, enabling those affected by the virus to enjoy productive lives. Our best science, the passion and dedication of our scientists and our extensive collaborations have enabled us to again make significant progress in 2022.\n\nNew and expanded U.S. regulatory approvals for HIV treatment: Our fruitful collaboration with ViiV Healthcare has helped to deliver a new and meaningful treatment option, with the world\u2019s first, complete long-acting injectable (LAI) HIV treatment regimen. The LAI regimen includes two ARV drugs, one developed by Janssen (rilpivirine) and the other by ViiV Healthcare (cabotegravir). This regimen is also known as CABENUVA (cabotegravir and rilpivirine) in the U.S. Both the once-monthly and the every-two-months versions of this HIV LAI treatment regimen for adults have been approved by health authorities in Europe, Switzerland and Canada. Additionally, the once-monthly version has been approved by the health authority in Australia.\n\nIn 2022, the FDA approved a label update for the product, giving HCPs and people living with HIV in the U.S. the option to start this once-monthly or every-two-month injectable treatment without the need for the oral lead-in phase. Additionally, in 2022, the FDA approved CABENUVA (cabotegravir and rilpivirine) for adolescents who are 12 years of age or older as the first and only LAI HIV regimen to be made available for eligible adolescents, reducing the daily pill burden through a treatment offered as few as six days per year. Adhering to treatment regimens can be difficult for adolescents, who may skip HIV medicine doses to hide their HIV-positive status from others.\n\nRegulatory approvals and studies in resource-limited settings: In 2022, the HIV LAI regimen was approved by the Botswana Medicines Regulatory Authority, marking the first approval of our co-developed HIV LAI regimen in a resource-limited country. We continue to seek regulatory approvals in additional RLS, including regulatory submissions in South Africa in 2021 and Thailand in 2022.\n\nThis longer-acting treatment regimen could be potentially game-changing for young people with HIV, particularly since it\u2019s not pill based.\n\nBrian Woodfall, M.D.\nVice President, Global Head of Development, Infectious Diseases & Vaccines, Janssen R&D\n\nKati Vandermeulen\nSenior Director and Compound Development Team Leader, Infectious Diseases & Vaccines, Janssen R&D\n\n28 UNAIDS, \u201cGlobal HIV & AIDS statistics \u2014 Fact sheet 2022,\u201d https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet, accessed February 2023. 29 HIV info, NIH.gov, \u201cHIV and Children and Adolescents,\u201d https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-and-children-and-adolescents, accessed February 2023.\nCombating pediatric HIV: In addition to the FDA approval of the HIV LAI regimen for adolescents, our work to expand improved solutions for children living with HIV is ongoing. A combination tablet, containing our product PREZISTA (darunavir) in a fixed-dose combination with ritonavir 50mg, received WHO Prequalification in 2022 and is helping meet treatment needs as a second-line treatment for adults and children. Johnson & Johnson has had a specific policy since 2012 not to enforce the patents it owns and controls on PREZISTA (darunavir) in sub-Saharan Africa and Least Developed Countries. In 2015, we expanded the geographical scope of the policy for pediatric products used in LMICs.\n\nIn 2021, children accounted for 4% of all people living with HIV but for 15% of all AIDS-related deaths. Johnson & Johnson is a co-founder of the New Horizons Collaborative, which aims to improve treatment and care for children and young adults with HIV in 11 countries across the region through drug donation and capacity building. In 2021, Johnson & Johnson, in collaboration with the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, renewed our commitment to the initiative, pledging to extend our darunavir donation program and continue enrolling new pediatric and young adult HIV patients through at least 2025. This is also an important step toward meeting our commitments to extend our darunavir donation program and continue enrolling new pediatric and young adult HIV patients through at least 2026. It is also an important step toward meeting our commitments to help tackle the challenge of pediatric HIV as part of the Rome, 5 Paediatric HIV and TB Action Plan. In 2022, more than 1,700 new pediatric and young adult HIV patients through at least 2025.\n\nHIV prevention for women and girls: The dapivirine vaginal ring, recommended in 2021 by the WHO as an additional prevention choice for women as part of a combination of prevention approaches, received approval in 2022 from the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority for use by women aged 18 and older to help reduce their risk of contracting HIV. Several approvals in Africa have been received, and there are additional applications currently pending.\n\nThe dapivirine ring is a long-acting HIV prevention method designed specifically for women. It was developed by the International Partnership for Microbicides under an exclusive license from Janssen for use of its ARV compound and is now owned by Population Council. The flexible, silicone ring is discreet, easy to use, has minimal side effects and only needs to be replaced monthly. The initial approvals and pilot implementation of the dapivirine ring in South Africa is an important step in the decades-long fight against HIV, particularly for adolescent girls and young women in sub-Saharan Africa, who are three times more likely to acquire HIV than their male counterparts.\n\nJohnson & Johnson was a founding member of the MenStar Coalition, which has helped more than 3 million men living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa get into treatment, with 96% becoming virally suppressed.\n\nLearning from HIV vaccine trials: In January 2023, together with a consortium of global partners, we discontinued Mosaico, our large-scale efficacy study in the Americas and Europe, that aimed to test the safety and efficacy of a specific composition of an investigational HIV vaccine regimen among men who have sex with men and transgender individuals. The study\u2019s independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board determined that the regimen was not effective in preventing HIV infection compared to placebo among study participants. No vaccine-related safety issues were identified.\n\nThe effects of gender inequalities on women\u2019s HIV risks are especially pronounced in sub-Saharan Africa, where women accounted for 63% of new HIV infections in 2021. The dapivirine vaginal ring, recommended in 2021 by the WHO as an additional prevention choice for women as part of a combination of prevention approaches, received approval in 2022 from the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority for use by women aged 18 and older to help reduce their risk of contracting HIV. Several approvals in Africa have been received, and there are additional applications currently pending.\n\nA mother and daughter wait to be tested at an HIV clinic in Kihihi, Uganda.

At Johnson & Johnson, we continue to meet this challenge, both in the lab and at the last mile of health, driven by our 10-year TB initiative and two decades of experience in the fight against TB.\n\nMore than three years since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world is still fighting to regain progress that had been made in combating TB. For the first time in several years, there was an increase in people falling ill with TB in 2021, and deaths continue to increase year over year.34\n\nGlobally, the estimated number of deaths from TB increased between 2019 and 2021, reversing years of decline between 2005 and 2019. In 2021, 1.6 million people died from TB, including 187,000 people with HIV.35\n\nRising AMR and the \u201cmissing millions\u201d of undiagnosed people continue to be challenges. In 2022, we made great strides to help reignite the global fight against TB through our collaborations, continue our commitment to our patients, reinvest in the development of new treatments and advocate on behalf of the people most affected by TB.\n\nTo learn more about TB and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s work to help end TB: Watch video\n\nWithout treatment, the death rate from TB is high (about 50%). With currently recommended treatments (a four- to six-month course of anti-TB drugs), about 85% of people can be cured.36\n\nAs a global healthcare company, Johnson & Johnson is committed to utilizing our unique strengths, including our decades of experience in research and development and our deep understanding of insights and behavior change to help end the TB pandemic.\n\nHoward Reid\nGlobal Head of Global Public Health and Social Impact, Johnson & Johnson\n\nMilestones in our fight against TB\n\nDecember 2022 marked 10 years since the accelerated approval of SIRTURO (bedaquiline) by the FDA. When Johnson & Johnson received approval for SIRTURO (bedaquiline) in 2012, it was the first TB medicine with a novel mechanism of action in more than 40 years. Since then, bedaquiline has been recommended by the WHO as a core component of all-oral treatment regimens for MDR-TB and is available to countries representing 99% of the global TB burden.\n\nA mother who is receiving treatment for TB and her three children in Gqeberha, South Africa.\nIn 2022, we reached a milestone with more than 586,000 courses of SIRTURO (bedaquiline), our multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) medicine, delivered cumulatively to 158 countries, including all 30 high-burden TB countries.37 This milestone represents a critical part of our 10-year initiative to help end TB, but our work continues. Johnson & Johnson is continuing to collaborate across sectors to enable access to our medicine for MDR-TB patients around the world, with a focus on expanding access to the pediatric formulation of bedaquiline as part of the Rome 6 Action Plan and safeguarding its long-term effectiveness through careful stewardship. Beyond our medicine, we are also continuing to support global efforts to help find the \u201cmissing millions\u201d of people with undiagnosed TB and advance innovative R&D to develop the next generation of TB treatments.\n\nSince 2012, bedaquiline has been registered in 72 countries, more than any other medicine specifically developed for the treatment of MDR-TB, advancing availability to countries with the greatest need.\n\n3 of 4 MDR-TB patients globally are now enrolled on all oral bedaquiline-containing regimens.\n\nIn 2022, new scientific data was generated to support the safety and efficacy of bedaquiline. The STREAM Stage 2 clinical trial is the world\u2019s largest clinical trial for MDR-TB and was conducted by the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit at University College London and sponsored by Vital Strategies, Inc. With nearly 600 participants enrolled, from eight countries on three continents, the trial found both bedaquiline-containing regimens, a nine-month oral regimen and a six-month regimen with eight weeks of second-line injectable, had superior efficacy compared with a nine-month injectable-containing regimen, with fewer cases of hearing loss. This fills an important gap in evidence on shortened regimens for MDR-TB.38 Additionally, a study39 of more than 5,000 patients with MDR-TB from 14 sites in South Africa showed that treatment with a bedaquiline-containing regimen was associated with better survival and effectiveness compared to non-bedaquiline-containing regimens in patients with MDR-TB.\n\nStudies such as these help underscore the importance of bedaquiline in helping solve one of today\u2019s greatest global health challenges and reinforce confidence in the effectiveness of the treatment in adults, adolescents and children.\n\nIn 2022, the Project to Accelerate New Treatments for Tuberculosis (PAN-TB) collaboration announced the execution of a joint development agreement (JDA) supporting the progression of two investigational TB combination treatment regimens into Phase 2 clinical development. The collaboration will evaluate whether the novel regimens, which combine registered products and new chemical entities, can effectively treat all forms of active pulmonary TB using substantially shorter treatment durations than existing drug regimens, with the goal of identifying a regimen suitable for Phase 3 development.\n\nRecognizing that no single organization produces the full range of drugs needed to respond to TB, the PAN-TB collaboration brings together philanthropic, nonprofit and private-sector organizations to accelerate the development of novel, shorter drug regimens to treat all forms of TB. Alongside Johnson & Johnson\u2019s bedaquiline, four additional antimicrobial agents are to be evaluated under the new JDA.\n\nCollaborating to advance TB drug regimens\n\nIn addition to PAN-TB, our membership in several research collaborations and consortia is ongoing. These include the following TB initiatives, which are all part of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI):\n\n\u2022 UNITE4TB: This global consortium of 30 collaborators from 13 countries, launched in 2021, aims to advance anti-TB science and enable the progression of new, safe and affordable treatment solutions for TB patients worldwide. During the first year of the project, a sponsor was chosen for the first Phase 2 clinical trials; innovative clinical trial designs were developed; and the project shortlisted the first trial sites in Africa, Asia, Europe and South America.\n\n\u2022 ERA4TB: The ERA4TB initiative integrates more than 30 organizations from the EU and the U.S. over a six-year period starting from 2020 to develop at least two or more new combination regimens with treatment-shortening potential ready for Phase 2 clinical evaluation.\n\nThere is still a large global gap between the estimated number of people who fell ill with TB and the number of people newly diagnosed, with 4.2 million people not diagnosed with the disease or not officially reported to national authorities in 2021, up from 3.2 million in 2019.40\n\nToday, our medicine has become the backbone of WHO-recommended all-oral treatment regimens for nearly all DR-TB patients, and this PAN-TB collaboration will allow us to further explore our medicine\u2019s potential to help transform TB treatment for patients in need while rising antimicrobial resistance.\n\nRuxandra Draghi-Akli, M.D., Ph.D.\nGlobal Head, Global Public Health R&D,\nJanssen R&D\n\n37 Upon review of the data and reconciliation processes, a change was needed to correct the annual number of courses of SIRTURO (bedaquiline) shipped for years 2014 and 2022. 38Gordill RL, Meredith SK, Nunn, A., et al. \u201cEvaluation of two short standardised regimens for the treatment of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (STREAM stage 2): an open-label, multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority trial.\u201d The Lancet, https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)02078-5/fulltext, accessed February 2023. 39 BACN, \u201cBedaquiline safety, efficacy, utilisation and emergence of resistance following treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients in South Africa: a retrospective cohort analysis.\u201d https://jcm.asm.org/content/10/1/186, accessed February 2023. 40 WHO, \u201cGlobal Tuberculosis Report 2022 Factsheet.\u201d https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/global-tuberculosis-report-2022-factsheet, accessed February 2023.\n\u2022 **RESPRI-TB**: An international research consortium of eight European academic and biotechnology organizations, IMI RESPRI-TB aims to develop a new, more efficient combination-drug regimen to cure MDR-TB, with a focus on shortening treatment duration and minimizing the likelihood of resistance.\n\n\u2022 **EU-PEARL**: A strategic consortia between the public and private sectors to shape the future of clinical trials, developing the specific Investigational Research Platform frameworks for trials ready to operate in disease areas still facing high unmet need.

The initiatives advance global efforts to help find the missing millions of people living with undiagnosed TB and are part of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s 10-year initiative to help drive progress toward ending the disease by 2030, aligned with a target of UN SDG 3.\n\nThrough wide collaboration, our initiatives aimed to engage young people to drive health-seeking behavior, build community awareness, improve active case finding and reduce stigma to enhance early diagnosis of TB, all with a goal of encouraging health-seeking behavior, increase awareness about the disease and promote early detection of symptoms.\n\nSome examples of our activations on World TB Day include:\n\n\u2022 **China**: In 2022, we celebrated the conclusion of a three-year collaboration with the Chinese government on TB, as China is one of 30 high-burden TB countries. Our role was to assist the Chinese government in addressing the TB challenge across the country and build evidence to support policy suggestions and technical solutions to the National Health Commission of China to further improve diagnosis rates. The project was carried out across a population of about 10 million in the three prefectures of Ganzhou, Linfen and Yulin and involved training healthcare providers, improving access to molecular tests for high-risk populations and streamlining TB case reporting and tracking mechanisms. Additionally, we collaborated to launch a youth volunteer and patient-finding initiative in the Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces and supported public awareness campaigns focused on TB, including the \u201cI\u2019m a Great Doctor\u201d TB special on Beijing TV. Learn more \u2192\n\n> We are proud to work with our key partners in China to drive impact against TB. Based on the successful outcome of the program, we will extend the key elements and integrated models achieved in the project to more places to continue to help enable a TB-free China.\n\n> Jenny Zheng\n> President, Xi\u2019an Janssen\n\n\u2022 **India**: In collaboration with the National TB Elimination Program in India, we launched a youth-focused, digital-first campaign called Be the Change: Bodhivat (\u201cchange\u201d in Hindi). Through social media, chatbots and more, the initiative aims to create youth \u201cchangemakers\u201d for TB to encourage health-seeking behavior, increase awareness about the disease and build youth engagement and participation in support of the Indian government\u2019s vision of a TB-free India. Additionally, with sponsorship from Johnson & Johnson, the MTV Staying Alive Foundation expanded on the success of MTV Nishedh, a youth-focused \u201cedutainment\u201d campaign in India, by launching a new season in November 2022. As part of this initiative, the Foundation developed a 10-episode drama series focused on the lives of young people in India and touched on TB storylines in an effort to raise awareness around the disease, reduce stigma and promote early detection of symptoms.\n\n> Every individual and every organization has the potential to make an impact in the fight against TB. With the power of multisector partnerships coming together in numbers and uniting under one common cause, we can help turn the tide against this devastating disease once and for all.\n\n> Sarthak Ranade\n> Area Managing Director, South East Asia and India, Janssen\n\n\u2022 **Southeast Asia**: Johnson & Johnson launched TB Warriors, an initiative in collaboration with the National TB programs of Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam to educate youth about TB in a fun and entertaining way using social media, mobile games and more. In the Philippines, we also collaborated with the Philippine Tuberculosis Society, Inc. to launch a youth community case-finding initiative, from awareness to care.\n\n\u2022 **South Africa**: Building on our pediatric DB-TB collaboration with Agity Innovations in South Africa, the Johnson & Johnson Foundation Scotland and Agity collaborated with EPICON to launch an initiative to improve health-seeking behavior among youth and conduct a new insight study to better understand barriers to care for children and youth.\n\n> Our engagement with the Ending Workplace TB initiative, a multisector collaboration that we co-launched in 2020, continued. In 2022, the initiative grew from 24 to 48 multinational companies pledging to address TB in their workforce. Learn more \u2192\n\n> Learn more about our progress in helping to end TB.\nEbola\n\nOver the past three decades, Ebola outbreaks have become larger and more frequent. In the last decade alone, the two deadliest outbreaks on record in West Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo further underscored the urgent need for innovation to protect communities at risk.\n\nEbola is a significant and growing health threat that was recently ranked by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention among the pathogens with the highest-risk trajectory and epidemic potential. In 2022 alone, there were three outbreaks\u2014one in Uganda was caused by the rarer Sudan ebolavirus, for which there is no approved vaccine or treatment. These outbreaks not only cause significant economic disruption, illness and loss of life, but they are particularly dangerous to healthcare workers and others working on the front lines.\n\nThe Zaire Ebola virus species has the highest mortality rate of 60% to 90%.41\n\nAt Johnson & Johnson, our vision is to protect people at risk of Ebola by preventing outbreaks before they can begin. We accelerated the development of our vaccine regimen in response to the 2014 outbreak in West Africa to help stop the spread in outbreak-adjacent areas. Today, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s two-dose Ebola vaccine regimen comprising ZABDENO (Ad26.ZEBOV) and Bavarian Nordic\u2019s MVABEA (MVA-BN-Filo) is indicated for active immunization of disease caused by the Ebola virus (Zaire ebolavirus species) in individuals \u22651 year of age. Building on the earlier approval from the European Commission and WHO Prequalification, our regimen received new regulatory Marketing Authorizations in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana in 2022 and in Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Uganda in early 2023. These continued approvals are key to enabling access to our vaccine regimen for people and communities who live under the threat of Ebola.\n\nAdditionally, the WHO\u2019s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts has recommended the proactive use of our Ebola vaccine regimen in non-outbreak settings to protect those most at risk, like healthcare workers and frontline workers. With this recommendation, countries have an additional tool to deploy in national pandemic prevention strategies and protect critical health and security infrastructure in countries living under the threat of this disease.\n\nAs of December 2022, more than 264,000 people worldwide had received a first dose of our Ebola vaccine regimen, including 242,000 who had been fully vaccinated.\n\nIn 2022, additional data on the safety and immunogenicity of our Ebola vaccine regimen was published in The New England Journal of Medicine.42 The data was generated in the Phase 2 clinical trial of the Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccinations (PREVAC), which evaluated our Ebola vaccine regimen, among others, in 2,800 participants across trial sites in Guinea, Liberia, Mali and Sierra Leone. These results add to a growing body of scientific literature that demonstrate the Johnson & Johnson Ebola vaccine regimen has a favorable safety profile, is well tolerated and induces a robust immune response against the Zaire Ebola virus species in adults and children (aged 1 \u2013 17 years).\n\nRecognizing African-led pandemic preparedness\n\nIn 2019, Johnson & Johnson supported the government of Rwanda and other partners to advance the Unprecedented Movement to drive a Unified Rwandan Initiative for National EBOla Immunization (UMURINZI), a large-scale vaccination effort to prevent Ebola along the Rwandan border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We shared insights from UMURINZI at a symposium at the 2nd Annual International Conference on Public Health in Africa in Rwanda. The UMURINZI campaign vaccinated more than 203,000 people with our Ebola vaccine regimen and provides valuable experience that can be used to help prevent and respond quickly to the threat of a pandemic.\n\nOur INGABO study, which was established as part of UMURINZI to evaluate the vaccine in healthy pregnant women, continued through 2022 with enrollment of 2,000 patients completed and 1,800 fully vaccinated by the end of the year. This is Johnson & Johnson\u2019s first pregnancy vaccine trial. With positive results, it would offer the only Ebola prevention option for pregnant women as part of our vision to halt the spread of Ebola.\n\nIn May 2021, the Johnson & Johnson Ebola vaccine regimen was granted a temporary use authorization in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to support the planned prophylactic deployment of our vaccine regimen to help prevent future outbreaks. Johnson & Johnson is collaborating with the Ministry of Health, Hygiene and Prevention of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, acting through its National Institute for Biomedical Research, to launch a new Ebola prevention program in Mbandaka and other parts of \u00c9quateur province. The program, launched in early 2023, aims to strengthen local capacity with expanded capabilities to prevent Ebola outbreaks and respond more swiftly when outbreaks occur. Johnson & Johnson is donating 45,000 Ebola vaccine regimens and working closely to support capacity development.\n\nLearn more about our progress in preventing the spread of Ebola.\nNeglected Tropical Diseases\n\nNeglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a cause of significant illness, disability and death, especially among children in some of the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable communities.\n\nIn 2022, we renewed our commitment to fight NTDs by joining the global community, including governments, foundations, nonprofit organizations and other pharmaceutical companies, to endorse the Kigali Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases. Together, we are recommitting to our long-established efforts to control and eliminate NTDs, a set of debilitating diseases that put at risk the health of 1.7 billion people around the world, especially the most vulnerable and under-resourced. We committed to the following:\n\n- donating up to 200 million doses annually of VERMOX (mebendazole), our medicine to treat intestinal worms, through 2025; and\n- advancing novel R&D programs to discover new medicines needed to beat dengue and leprosy.\n\nOf the 20 NTDs prioritized in the WHO roadmap 2021 \u2013 2030, Johnson & Johnson research and medicines support the treatment and prevention of three high-prevalence NTDs: dengue; soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH), also known as intestinal worms; and leprosy.\n\nDonating more than 2.2 billion doses of VERMOX (mebendazole): For more than 15 years, Johnson & Johnson has been at the forefront of global efforts to beat NTDs, donating more than 2.2 billion doses of VERMOX (mebendazole) for the treatment of intestinal worms to field partners in more than 60 countries. This was further bolstered by the development of a new chewable formulation of VERMOX (mebendazole) in 2019 that can be easily administered to children as young as 1 year of age, supporting the training of community health workers, enabling better data management and supporting the development of new diagnostics. Through tireless and collaborative efforts, countless children in need have been given the opportunity to recover, play, learn and thrive.\n\nSince 2006, the VERMOX (mebendazole) program donated more than 2.2 billion doses, treating up to 100 million patients annually in 61 countries. More than 200 million doses of VERMOX Chewable were donated in 2022 alone.\n\nInnovation to combat flavivirus\n\nWe also invited scientists from across the APAC and Oceania regions to take part in our Global Health Discovery QuickFire Challenge: Flavivirus Infections. The challenge aimed to attract potentially groundbreaking ideas to treat, control or prevent flavivirus disease. The innovator(s) with the best potential solution receive grant funding from a total pool of up to $500,000; access to the JLABS APAC community, including a dedicated workstation for one year at JLABS @ Shanghai; and mentorship from Johnson & Johnson experts.\n\nTreating leprosy\n\nPreliminary data from Janssen\u2019s Phase 2a proof-of-concept study show promising results for bedaquiline for the treatment of leprosy. We shared these results at the 21st International Leprosy Congress 2022, noting that our compound bedaquiline appears to be generally well tolerated when dosed as monotherapy over a period of eight weeks in a leprosy study population consisting of multibacillary leprosy patients, the most advanced form of leprosy, followed by 12 months of a WHO-recommended leprosy treatment regimen. The preliminary data mark an important milestone in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s pledge to advance research and development of new treatments for leprosy. We shared these results at the 21st International Leprosy Congress 2022, noting that our compound bedaquiline appears to be generally well tolerated when dosed as monotherapy over a period of eight weeks in a leprosy study population consisting of multibacillary leprosy patients, the most advanced form of leprosy, followed by 12 months of a WHO-recommended leprosy treatment regimen. The preliminary data mark an important milestone in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s pledge to advance research and development of new treatments for leprosy.\n\nProgressing dengue treatment and research\n\nJanssen\u2019s Dengue Compound Discovery Program, which started in 2007 in collaboration with KU Leuven Rega Institute and the Centre for Drug Design and Discovery in Belgium, has developed a dengue-specific antiviral compound with a novel mechanism of action that could potentially protect against and treat all dengue serotypes. Dengue eradication or elimination is not feasible due to existing animal reservoirs and limitations of current protective measures against the multiple strains and serotypes circulating. The toolbox to combat dengue needs to grow, and antivirals could be a vital new tool, helping to slow down outbreaks and limit epidemic levels of cases.\n\nUpon proof-of-concept in a non-human primate model, and following results from our first-in-human Phase 1 double-blind study that showed the compound is safe and well tolerated, we progressed in 2022 to Phase 2a clinical studies to evaluate our antiviral compound for prevention and treatment of dengue. One study is a human challenge study conducted in collaboration with Johns Hopkins University, University of Vermont and NIH. The other is being conducted in collaboration with Singapore\u2019s Duke-NUS Medical School, which is also home to Johnson & Johnson\u2019s third Satellite Center for Global Health Discovery in APAC, launched in June 2022. This Satellite Center aims to catalyze investment and bolster R&D infrastructure for flaviviruses and builds on Johnson & Johnson\u2019s decade-long legacy and ongoing collaboration with Duke-NUS in public health research.\n\nThe establishment of the Satellite Center at Duke-NUS builds upon our strong track record in flavivirus research and bench-to-bedside innovations and will facilitate antiviral drug discovery for the prevention and treatment of flavivirus-associated diseases that are affecting communities in Southeast Asia and beyond.\n\nLearn more about our progress in addressing NTDs.\nAntimicrobial Resistance\n\nAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is already a crisis, made even more concerning by the COVID-19 pandemic. As microorganisms develop resistance to medicines that millions of people have relied upon for years, common diseases are becoming difficult or impossible to cure and the spread of infections harder to control.\n\nAs the largest, most diversified healthcare products company, with a purpose to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity, we care deeply about reversing the development of AMR. Rising AMR has been ranked among the most significant health threats facing the world by the WHO and, left uncontrolled, could turn routine infections and surgical procedures into life-or-death situations.\n\nTo help counter the AMR threat, Johnson & Johnson has committed to investing in and advancing critical science, as well as providing access to antibiotics and safeguarding their long-term effectiveness, to meet public health needs. As part of these efforts, Janssen is leading the pursuit for novel vaccines and therapeutics to tackle a range of drug-resistant infections, including DR-TB and E. coli. Specifically, our decades of investment in helping end TB is a critical contributor to our efforts to outpace AMR. Learn more.\n\nWHO has declared that AMR is one of the top 10 global public health threats facing humanity. Annually, 1.2 million deaths are attributable to AMR, and 4.9 million deaths are associated with AMR.\n\nJohnson & Johnson is also a founding member of the AMR Action Fund and the AMR Industry Alliance, which are focused on creating a sustainable ecosystem of investment and innovation to tackle the AMR threat. In 2022, the AMR Action Fund made its first investments in two companies, Adaptive Phage Therapeutics and Venatorx Pharmaceuticals, promising to deliver innovations that can change the treatment landscape for drug-resistant infections and advance the AMR Action Fund\u2019s goal of bringing two to four new antibiotics to market within a decade. Our $100 million commitment to the Fund is helping advance toward this goal.\n\nAdvancing our ExPEC vaccine: ExPEC is one of the leading pathogens in the AMR crisis. Last year, we initiated our Phase 3 Embrace study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of a single injection of our investigational vaccine to prevent Invasive ExPEC Disease (IED), such as sepsis, caused by the nine most prevalent serotypes of ExPEC, in adults aged 60 years and older. It is a multicenter event-driven vaccine efficacy study featuring a group-sequential design and includes over 18,500 adults aged 60 years and older with one or more additional risk factors for invasive disease.\n\nAntibiotics have been the backbone of modern medicine for more than a century, but increasing resistance threatens to render them ineffective. Our innovation in new antibiotic drug discovery must outpace this rising threat of multi- or extreme-drug-resistant pathogens.\n\nDedicating resources to AMR science: In 2022, we expanded our J&J Centers for Global Health Discovery (J&J Centers) with the launch of the Johnson & Johnson Satellite Center for Global Health Discovery at the Holistic Drug Discovery and Development (H3D) Centre at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. This Satellite Center is working to drive new solutions to address the present and rising threat of AMR with a specific focus on multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB). Teams from Janssen and H3D will leverage their combined global, institutional and regional strengths to bolster the early stage science, innovation and talent development needed to tackle AMR. Research at the new Satellite Center will build on Johnson & Johnson\u2019s decades of work accelerating innovation\u2014from the lab-to-last-mile of healthcare\u2014to outpace the threat of AMR.\n\nSharing data to accelerate AMR research: In 2022, we were pleased to commit to participating in a groundbreaking data-sharing initiative to increase understanding of AMR, launched by nonprofit Vivli. The AMR Register makes it possible for biopharmaceutical companies to share susceptibility data on infection-causing pathogens for the first time ever in one online platform, marking a critical step in combating the growing global health threat of AMR. With the active participation from leading pharmaceutical and biotech enterprises, including Johnson & Johnson, researchers will be able to use the AMR Register to translate masses of AMR surveillance data into meaningful action that saves lives and preserves antibiotics for future generations.\n\nLearn more about our progress in outpacing AMR.\nHealthcare Innovation\n\nInnovation has been an essential part of the fabric of Johnson & Johnson for more than 135 years. Thanks to the incredible efforts of the tens of thousands of scientists, researchers, engineers, designers and clinicians, we have pioneered multiple breakthroughs to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity.\n\nWe advance innovation at Johnson & Johnson across many channels, as outlined in our Position on Innovation.\n\nR&D Investment (Millions)\n\n| Year | Investment (Millions) |\n|------|-----------------------|\n| 2018 | $10,775               |\n| 2019 | $11,355               |\n| 2020 | $12,159               |\n| 2021 | $14,714               |\n| 2022 | $14,603               |\n\nIn 2022, we opened our latest state-of-the-art Janssen R&D facility, more than doubling our R&D presence in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Pharmaceutical innovation is a critical component of global progress in healthcare, and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s significant investments will enable us to discover and develop transformational medicines that improve human health for the patients we serve around the world.\n\nJohn Reed M.D., Ph.D.\nExecutive Vice President, Pharmaceuticals, R&D\n\nOncology\n\nIn line with our strategy to address unique cellular targets through immunotherapy treatment regimens, and our deep expertise in multiple myeloma, we realized breakthrough developments in multiple myeloma therapies in 2022, addressing high unmet need to profoundly impact the lives of patients living with this form of cancer.\n\n- EU and FDA approval of CARVYKTI (ciltaclabtagene autoleucel) was granted for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after four or more prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. CARVYKTI is a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy that works by harnessing the patient\u2019s own immune system, or T-cells, to attack cancer cells.\n\n- FDA breakthrough therapy designation was granted for talquetamab, a first-in-class bispecific antibody for the treatment of heavily pretreated patients living with multiple myeloma.\n\nGiven the heterogeneity of the disease, multiple myeloma is incredibly challenging to treat. Nonetheless, the dedication of those at Janssen working to cure this disease has enabled the conceptualization and execution of a rich R&D program that enabled a significant step forward for the entire multiple myeloma community.\n\nYusri Elsayed M.D., M.H.Sc., Ph.D.\nVice President, Hematologic Malignancies Disease Area Leader, Janssen R&D\n\nFurther advances in treating leukemia were also achieved in 2022, with two significant approvals for IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib):\n\n- EU marketing authorization was granted for the expanded use of our IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) in a fixed-duration combination regimen for adults with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This marks the first-ever approval of IMBRUVICA in a fixed-duration regimen for patients with this form of cancer.\n\n- FDA approval for IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) was granted as the first and only treatment for children under 12 with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), a life-threatening complication that can occur after a stem cell or bone marrow transplant, when newly transplanted donor cells attack the transplant recipient\u2019s body. Transplant is sometimes used to treat children with hemoglobin problems such as sickle cell anemia or thalassemia and for children suffering from leukemia.\n\nAdditionally, Johnson & Johnson Innovation entered into new collaborations to advance research in specialist oncology fields:\n\n- Seeking new cancer treatments: Janssen Oncology and Hangzhou DAC Biotechnology, a discovery and clinical stage biotechnology company, formed a research collaboration and license agreement with an aim to discover and develop novel antibody drug conjugate candidates for up to five targets using DAC Biotechnology\u2019s expertise and innovative platform combined with Janssen Oncology\u2019s proprietary antibodies. This research collaboration will focus on prostate cancer, hematologic malignancies and solid tumor targeted therapy to help maximize the impact of early stage research to meet the significant unmet need in cancer-related healthcare challenges.\n\n- Optimizing CAR cell treatment: Janssen Biotech formed a research collaboration with Serotiny, a gene and cell therapy development company, to leverage Serotiny\u2019s multi-protein domain discovery platform and Janssen\u2019s antibody development and cell therapy expertise to create next-generation CAR-based cell therapies. This collaboration has the potential to advance scientific innovation to develop next-generation cellular therapies with improved therapeutic function and enhanced clinical benefit that could positively impact the lives of patients and families.\nImmunology\n\nWe seek to redefine the standard of care for people living with immune-mediated diseases by focusing on unmet patient need and actionable science. Two key products for the autoimmune community, STELARA (ustekinumab) and TREMFYA (guselkumab), made progress in 2022:\n\n- STELARA received FDA approval for treatment of pediatric patients aged six years and older with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA).\n- TREMFYA celebrated its five-year milestone of the approval of this treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis. In 2022, Janssen published a comprehensive analysis, demonstrating that TREMFYA ranked highest among all approved therapies for skin clearance in the treatment of PsA.\n\nWe advanced critical research in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) such as Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis (UC) and PsA. We progressed our work studying oral cytokine inhibitors as a new form of treatment for people living with IMIDs with a Phase 2b trial for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. What\u2019s more, our investigational novel combination therapy of guselkumab (IL-23) and golimumab (TNF) also showed promising results for the treatment of UC.\n\nBuilding on our legacy of leadership in immunology innovation, Janssen is investigating a targeted treatment, nipocalimab, to address the underlying cause of antibody-driven disease. Nipocalimab is being investigated in maternal fetal diseases, rare diseases and prevalent rheumatologic diseases, where unmet need is high and, in some cases, no therapy is currently available.\n\nNeuroscience\n\nJanssen intends to reconceptualize the diagnosis and treatment of nervous system disorders with the aim to reduce the burden and disability experienced by patients worldwide. Researchers at Janssen are pioneering multiple approaches in neuroscience to reduce the disability caused by serious neuropsychiatric, neurodegenerative and central nervous system autoantibody diseases while extending scientific advances in precision medicine:\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD): We are leading the way to revolutionize AD with a differentiated tau portfolio that employs the latest advancements in precision medicine, data science and digital health to use unique biomarkers to speed earlier diagnosis, drug development and decision making.\n\nOur biomarker team developed and is evaluating a blood test to predict central amyloid positivity and tau status\u2014indicators of AD\u2014with high accuracy. We are also developing novel digital biomarkers in collaboration with leading technology firms. For example, together with kiecelents, we are piloting speech biomarker technology using AI and machine learning to identify abnormalities in speech patterns that may be predictive of early disease.\n\nDepression: Our neuroscience team is leading the charge against the most serious forms of depression, a mental health condition that places a heavy burden on society, affecting millions of patients worldwide. We launched the first new mechanism in decades, SPRAVATO (esketamine) CIII nasal spray, for use in conjunction with an oral antidepressant in March 2019 for adults with treatment resistant depression, and in August 2020 for depressive symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) with acute suicidal ideation or behavior. In addition, Janssen is advancing drug candidates with novel mechanisms of action for depression, including aticaprant and seltorexant. Altogether, these efforts aim to provide patients with more potential options for combating depression.\n\nMyasthenia gravis (MG): This is a highly debilitating, rare autoantibody disease for which there currently is no cure and which can be difficult to diagnose. We are investigating nipocalimab to address a range of serious autoantibody-mediated diseases, including MG. Results from our Phase 2 study with nipocalimab in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) showed a rapid, robust and sustained clinical response over placebo. The Phase 3 trial in adults and Phase 2 study in children are underway.\n\nCardiovascular, Metabolism & Retina\n\nThe Cardiovascular, Metabolism & Retina therapeutic area covers some of the most common causes of death, such as cardiovascular disease, and many other life-threatening conditions that significantly impact overall health, including chronic kidney disease and retinal diseases.\n\nIn 2022, we announced the results of our Phase 2 AXIOMATIC-Secondary Stroke Prevention study of milvexian, a novel oral anticoagulant, which enrolled more than 2,000 patients with a primary ischemic stroke. Early stroke recurrence after ischemic stroke remains a significant risk despite advances in secondary prevention. The data from the AXIOMATIC-Secondary Stroke Prevention study showed an approximate 30% relative risk reduction in recurrent symptomatic ischemic strokes and a favorable safety profile in three arms of the study compared to placebo. This suggests that milvexian has potential to improve outcomes for stroke patients in clinical practice. These results, along with findings from the AXIOMATIC-TKR study, set the stage for our comprehensive Phase 3 program.\n\nWe also received encouraging results from a Phase 1/2 study evaluating investigational gene therapy botaritigene sparoparvovec for the treatment of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP), a rare condition that causes progressive vision loss, starting in childhood with night blindness and leading to legal blindness by middle age. Using gene therapy approaches we are also advancing candidate therapeutics for common ocular diseases, including geographic atrophy.\nIn a period of expansion and innovation, J&J MedTech delivered more than 30 significant product launches in the past two years, bringing advanced medical technologies to more people around the world.\n\nNew patient-centered innovation: Across our wide range of innovative surgical technologies and solutions for patients and HCPs, we seek continuous improvement to deliver better patient outcomes with safety, efficiency and reliability. Examples from 2022 include:\n\n- Part of J&J MedTech\u2019s DePuy Synthes\u2019 VELYS Digital Surgery Platform, CUPTIMIZE Hip-Spine Analysis is the latest surgical planning feature in VELYS Hip Navigation. It is a simple, x-ray-based digital tool that uses patient specific data to help surgeons assess dislocation risk and identify patients with abnormal pelvic tilt who may require unique cup placement or dual mobility design.\n\n- DePuy Synthes specializes in orthopaedics solutions to help heal and restore movement for millions of patients. In China, working with Johnson & Johnson\u2019s 3D Printing Group, DePuy Synthes is bringing to the Chinese market a highly personalized 3D-printed cranial implant made from a thermoplastic polymer. 3D execution enables the availability of these critical implants at a much lower cost and with shorter lead times than implants manufactured traditionally to help ensure that every surgery is safe, precise and time efficient. Production of the cranial implants is now up and running at the DePuy Synthes Suzhou Manufacturing Plant.\n\n- J&J MedTech\u2019s Ethicon franchise received FDA clearance for urology procedures using the MONARCH Endoscopic Robotic Platform. MONARCH is now the first and only multispecialty, flexible robotic solution for use in both bronchoscopy and urology.\n\n- Ethicon continued to advance a next-generation treatment option for lung tumors to minimize the impact of surgery for patients and allow for speedier recovery. Ethicon\u2019s solution is through transbronchial microwave ablation using its NEUWAVE FLEX Microwave Ablation System guided by its MONARCH Platform. Ethicon\u2019s clinical trial for patients with lung tumors, the POWER study, aims to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of this innovative approach. In December 2022, a milestone was achieved with the first patient successfully treated as part of the POWER study.\n\nToward the close of December 2022, we completed our acquisition of Abiomed, Inc., a world leader in heart recovery solutions and the creator of the world\u2019s first totally implantable artificial heart. Abiomed brings a rich history of innovation in cardiovascular care that complements our existing leadership in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias through our Biosense Webster electrophysiology business.\n\nAdvancing treatment of stroke: We collaborate with physicians and academics and invest in scientific research to advance the treatment of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Stroke is a leading cause of death with 15 million people worldwide affected by stroke annually. In 2022, Cerenovus, a J&J MedTech company, launched the EMBOGUARD Balloon Guide Catheter as part of the CERENOVUS Stroke Solutions suite of technologies. EMBOGUARD is designed to optimize the removal of blood clots by controlling blood flow locally during thrombectomy procedures. Balloon guide catheters have been shown to increase the ability to restore blood flow after one pass, reduce procedure time, and reduce the odds of clot fragments breaking off and causing new ischemic events.\n\nAhmet Tezel\nCompany Group Chairman and Global Head of MedTech Innovation and R&D, Johnson & Johnson\n\nA 3D-printed cranial plate sample produced by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s 3D Printing Group.\n\n47 WHO, \u201cStroke, Cerebrovascular accident,\u201d https://www.who.int/health-topics/stroke-cerebrovascular-accident/index.html, accessed April 2023. 48 J&J MedTech, \u201cCERENOVUS Launches EMBOGUARD\u2122 Balloon Guide Catheter to Use In The Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke,\u201d https://www.jnjmedtech.com/en-US/news-events/cerenovus-launches-emboguard-balloon-guide-catheter-use-treatment-acute-ischemic.\nPreventing and treating atrial fibrillation (AFib): We advanced solutions to address AFib with new products, research and awareness efforts to inform and help patients, including:\n\n- In Europe, Biosense Webster launched its first radiofrequency balloon ablation catheter, HELIOSTAR, to enable physicians in Europe to advance safe, effective and efficient treatment solutions for patients suffering from AFib. In Europe, catheter ablation is a recommended first-line treatment option.49\n- OCTARAY Mapping Catheter was launched for mapping cardiac arrhythmias, including AFib, to assist physicians in capturing precise information for catheter ablation procedures with enhanced clarity and speed.\n- In April 2022, Biosense Webster announced that the first patients were enrolled in the admIRE clinical trial in the U.S. to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the company\u2019s investigational Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) platform, the principal components of which are the VARIPULSE catheter and the TRUPULSE generator, for the treatment of AFib. PFA represents a new approach to treating AFib, utilizing a controlled electric field\u2014instead of thermal energy\u2014to ablate and treat cardiac tissue, which could be an exciting advance for physicians and patients and may have a variety of benefits. Biosense Webster is working to bring a versatile portfolio of PFA solutions\u2014complementary to our RF catheter portfolio\u2014to address various ablation strategies in the treatment of AFib.\n- J&J MedTech company Biosense Webster, progressed research into AFib patient behaviors in North America to help inform ways to support AFib prevention and treatment by physicians and patients. Biosense Webster\u2019s AFib PulseCheck Survey among adults diagnosed with AFib revealed that, despite fears and anxiety about AFib, patients delayed seeking treatment, and many ended up in the emergency room due to AFib. These insights provide clues as to how best to promote AFib behavior change, especially among high-risk patients.\n- In China, Biosense Webster supported a new Starlight AFib Public Awareness Campaign to help popularize knowledge on the prevention and treatment of AFib. As the top cause of death for the elderly, cardiovascular diseases are becoming a major health threat to Chinese people.\n\nAFib is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia. It has been estimated that 6 to 12 million people worldwide will suffer with this condition in the U.S. by 2050 and 17.9 million people in Europe by 2060.50\n\nWith more splines and electrodes, the increased surface area coverage and improved signal quality with the OCTARAY Mapping Catheter allows me to better understand the anatomy and conduction properties of the chamber of interest.\n\nDr. Amit Thosani\nDirector of Cardiac Electrophysiology, Allegheny Health Network\n\n49 Hindricks G, Putapa T, Dagnes N, et al, \u201c2020 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation developed in collaboration with the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS),\u201d Euro Heart J, 2021 Feb 1;42(5):373-498, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32860505, accessed February 2023.\n50 Lippi G, Sanchis-Gomar S, and Cervallin G, \u201cGlobal epidemiology of atrial fibrillation: An increasing epidemic and public health challenge,\u201d Int J Stroke, 2021 Feb;16(2):217-221, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31955707, accessed February 2023.\nData Science & Digital Health\n\nAt Johnson & Johnson, we view innovation in data science and digital health as a critical engine of our long-term business success and the foundation of our positive contribution to sustainable development and an equitable and inclusive society.\n\nAcross our sectors, we combine innovative technologies with leading science to deliver care in groundbreaking new ways.

Examples from among the many ways that AI, ML and other data science methods are being leveraged include:\n\n- Bladder cancer trial recruitment: Janssen established a collaboration with Paige, a global leader in clinical AI applications in pathology, to deploy the presence of certain alterations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes in patients with advanced urothelial cancer, also known as bladder cancer. The goal is to provide physicians with insights to help tailor patients\u2019 treatment plans and facilitate clinical trial recruitment. The biomarker test was validated through Janssen clinical trials and subsequently deployed for screening patients across clinical sites. This marks an important advancement in medicine and data science, demonstrating the potential for more rapid, optimized care for patients in need.\n\n- Early detection of pulmonary hypertension (PH): The FDA granted Breakthrough Device Designation for an AI-enhanced, Pulmonary Hypertension Early Detection Algorithm, developed in collaboration between Janssen; Anumana, a health technology company; and Mayo Clinic. The algorithm is a precise, non-invasive screening tool that could help address the unmet need for earlier diagnosis of patients with PH, which may otherwise go unnoticed until the disease has advanced to the point of limiting treatment efficacy. Downloadable by a physician to a digital device or accessed via the cloud, the algorithm will be accessible for broad-scale use in early detection of PH, if approved.\n\n- Engaging patients remotely to study immune-mediated skin conditions: We launched a remote immunodermatology observational study to capture more than 100,000 images from patients living with immune-mediated skin diseases to support the development of AI algorithms needed for creating objective measures of disease severity on diverse skin types. In our study, patients used their smartphone to capture photos of their skin over time, creating a unique data set with the volume required for detailed analysis. Currently, the severity of immune-mediated skin conditions is measured by doctors using the naked eye, which may lead to high variability in severity assessment. In this digitally enabled remote study, we are generating new ways of assessing immune-mediated skin conditions, enabling improved treatment solutions in the future. Moreover, by offering the ability to assess skin conditions remotely, technology is helping to reduce the burden on patients who otherwise would be required to take time from work and family to visit a doctor\u2019s office or clinical center. This is one example of how Johnson & Johnson is leveraging digital tools to help improve clinical trial diversity by reducing the burden of participation in clinical studies.\n\nNajat Khan, Ph.D.\nChief Data Science Officer and Global Head, Strategy & Operations, Janssen R&D\n\nJim Swanson\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Information Officer, Johnson & Johnson\n\nWe launched a remote immunodermatology observational study to capture more than 100,000 images from patients living with immune-mediated skin diseases to support the development of AI algorithms needed for creating objective measures of disease severity on diverse skin types.

Biosense Webster introduced CARTONET, the first cloud-based data management system that has the potential to improve procedure efficiency and outcomes. Using a deep learning algorithm, CARTONET evaluates patterns, enabling physicians to assess their performance more easily. CARTONET is compatible with CARTO, Biosense Webster\u2019s 3D mapping system that integrates all our electrophysiology mapping and ablation catheters.\n\n\u2022 Improving efficiency and accuracy of knee surgery: DePuy Synthes uses ML to right-size total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) implants. By creating and deploying ML-driven predictions for TKA and THA procedures using direct customer electronic medical records, DePuy Synthes can tailor the list of required components to meet the need of each specific surgery, rather than delivering all possible standard sizes. This makes surgery coordination more efficient and accurate.\n\n\u2022 Automating imaging for improved eye disease diagnosis: Using a custom-designed, ML- and AI-driven device, Johnson & Johnson Vision has automated the processing of meibomian gland (MG) imaging, leading to better understanding of a patient\u2019s MG disease. MGs produce meibum, an oily substance that prevents evaporation of the eye\u2019s tear film, necessary for full eye health. Connecting the new device to Johnson & Johnson Vision\u2019s LIPISCAN imager enables consistent evaluation of a patient\u2019s MG disease based on real-world outcomes, enabling better diagnosis and medical intervention.\n\nEmpowering our teams for digital innovation\n\nAs a large and diverse organization, applying digital tools across many dimensions of our work in digital health and processes, we invest in sharing our work and progress internally, encouraging learning and reapplication of successful ideas and creating awareness for the latest technologies among our teams. In 2022, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Data Science Council published its internal Data Science Business Impact Report showcasing the most compelling examples of how teams from R&D, commercial, supply chain and Enterprise functions are working to make the promise and potential of data science a reality.\n\nWe also held our annual Janssen R&D Data Science & Digital Health Symposium, bringing together more than 2,000 colleagues for two days of discussion and presentations on how Janssen R&D is using data science and digital health as a transformational force in medicine and for patients. More than 75 data science and digital health projects were showcased at the Symposium, and more than 200 speakers, including experts from across industry, startups and academia as well as Johnson & Johnson executives, shared their insights.\n\nWe want our employees to be fluent in the language of data science. We can only achieve this goal through personalized learning and development opportunities that support the upskilling of critical capabilities needed to be most effective in an increasingly digital world.\n\nAshley McEvoy\nExecutive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, MedTech, Johnson & Johnson\n\nPeter Fasolo, Ph.D.\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Human Resources Officer, Johnson & Johnson\nInnovation Through Collaboration\n\nJohnson & Johnson Innovation accelerates early stage innovation through strategic partnership. By connecting the best science and technology entrepreneurs to our global resources and expertise, we take on the world\u2019s toughest healthcare challenges and aim to improve the health of everyone, everywhere.\n\nWe connect potential collaborators to world-leading resources and aim to support them to advance transformation science and technology across the spectrum of pharmaceutical, medical devices and consumer healthcare. Similarly, we collaborate widely across many groups, partnerships, consortia and research agreements to accelerate progress in ways that no company can achieve alone.\n\nAs we prepare for the future, we at Johnson & Johnson feel our efforts will require new ideas, a new generation of entrepreneurs and the deployment of new tools for scientific inquiry to generate, aggregate and analyze data; develop insights; and test hypotheses that could inform the development of new ways to prevent, intercept and cure disease.\n\nWilliam N. Hait, M.D., Ph.D.\nExecutive Vice President, Chief External Innovation and Medical Officer, Johnson & Johnson\n\nIn 2022, 10 new QuickFire Challenges were launched and four challenges from 2021 were completed.\n\nOur Advancing Health Equity QuickFire Challenge received submissions focused on enabling inclusive clinical trial design and equitable clinical decision making, implementing community-based early diagnostics and education of patients and providers to advance health equity. Three awardees received grant funding from a total pool of $400,000, access to the global JLABS network and mentorship from experts across Johnson & Johnson.\n\nQuickFire Challenge awardees in 2022 included 35% women-led teams and 20% teams led by people of color. Four QuickFire Challenges launched in 2022 were specifically health equity focused, with grant funding from a total pool of $1.55 million awarded to 14 teams.\n\nOur 2022 Maternal-Fetal Immune Disorders QuickFire Challenge: Innovating for Health Equity sought to improve immune-mediated pregnancy outcomes in mothers and children from BIPOC communities. The challenge awarded a total of $500,000 in grant funding to two promising organizations that aim to advance health equity by addressing unmet medical needs in pregnancy care.\n\nOur 2022 Vets QuickFire Challenge: Lung Cancer & Physical Trauma reflected our commitment to keeping veterans healthy and advancing healthcare innovation for the benefit of the military community. The Challenge sought ideas to directly address the unique healthcare needs of the military community, including lung cancer and physical trauma, and made grants totaling $500,000 to six awardees, three focusing on lung cancer and three offering solutions to address physical trauma.\n\nActivating health innovators and entrepreneurs through our JLABS QuickFire Challenges is an effective way to advance research and practical innovation to address a range of unmet medical needs. The QuickFire Challenge is a crowdsourcing platform committed to identifying and cultivating potential health solutions to change the trajectory of healthcare.\n\nMany QuickFire Challenges champion health equity by seeking to identify potential solutions that serve historically under-resourced communities and reaching a wide range of diverse scientists, researchers and innovators from around the world.\n\nPromoting diversity in healthcare startups: Through our Johnson & Johnson Innovation ecosystem, we are empowering healthcare startups to embrace DEI in the early stages of their company\u2019s life\u2014when they are creating their identity, research focus and approach, and culture. To this end, in 2022, we introduced the Johnson & Johnson Innovation Health Equity Assessment Tool (HEAT) to more than 550 Johnson & Johnson Innovation collaborating companies as a voluntary survey designed to help early stage innovators benchmark their health equity maturity and how they are considering health disparities in their company leadership, potential healthcare solutions and delivery. The self-assessment is paired with the Johnson & Johnson Innovation Health Equity e-Learning Module to raise awareness and help establish a baseline understanding before completion. The e-Learning Module is also available to the public. Learn more \u2192\n\nWe also introduced the Johnson & Johnson Innovation Board Fellows program, a one-year, multifaceted education, executive coaching and mentorship program that will help strengthen our diverse candidacy for potential board leadership positions. In June 2022, the inaugural class of five Johnson & Johnson Innovation Board Fellows began their one-year program. The Board Fellows are paired with JJDC mentors to help them further understand developmental opportunities and achieve their full potential as potential Board Directors.\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion in Clinical Trials\n\nJohnson & Johnson has made diversity, equity and inclusion in clinical trials a priority to help create transformational therapies that work for all patients.\n\nAn important step on our journey to achieving health equity is ensuring everyone has the opportunity to participate in clinical research, should it be right for them.\n\nUnderrepresented populations face a variety of barriers that impact clinical trial enrollment, including fear and mistrust, lack of awareness and logistical challenges. Through structured processes to examine and advance DEI in clinical trials, including multiple partnerships for enhancing awareness and building trust among under-resourced and underrepresented communities, we hope to change the trajectory of health disparities in clinical research.\n\nAccording to the FDA, 75% of clinical trial participants for new molecular entities and therapeutic biologics approved in 2020 were white, 8% were Black or African American, 6% were Asian and 11% were Hispanic.46\n\nIn 2022, our Janssen Diversity, Equity & Inclusion in Clinical Trials (DEICT) team created a template to embed diversity into the clinical trial process. The template is relevant for all Janssen therapeutic areas and covers dimensions of diversity including race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and socioeconomic factors. Using this template, and insights from Janssen\u2019s Research Includes Me initiative, equitable representation in clinical trials can be strengthened.\n\nResearch Includes Me meets communities where they are with educational materials, connects patients to current trials and partners with advocacy groups to understand these communities\u2019 needs and build trust in the safety of clinical trials and the healthcare system overall. In 2022, Research Includes Me connected more than 84 million people to messages on the importance of diverse representation in clinical research through its website, co-hosted and multilingual events and participation at community events with Mobile Health vans.\n\nIn 2022, our DEICT team completed a clinical trial diversity plan across all Janssen\u2019s therapeutic areas that includes supporting local markets and a metrics reporting dashboard to help guide further progress. This approach also aligns with anticipated FDA initiatives to expand action and disclosure on clinical trial diversity. Within Janssen, different research teams demonstrate their commitment in each area. For example, the Janssen Immunology DEI Working Group formulated its specific DEI strategy and made progress by hiring racially and ethnically diverse leaders for Janssen R&D, enhancing culturally relevant training, hosting speaker events on racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare and engaging in innovation and partnerships to promote inclusive research.\n\nJanssen was one of the first organizations to proactively submit a diversity plan to the FDA for an oncology trial, well ahead of the regulatory body\u2019s new guidance on initiatives to expand action and disclosure on clinical trial diversity. The FDA\u2019s commitment to prioritizing diversity in clinical research has the potential to better connect regulatory approaches with the industry\u2019s broader health equity goals, which will help Janssen deliver on its mission to create a future where disease is a thing of the past.\n\nImproving representation in cancer clinical trials: Janssen Oncology supports enhancing clinical research capabilities in Africa through collaboration with the African Access Initiative (AAI), a public-private partnership driven by the BIO Ventures for Global Health, a nonprofit that accelerates R&D for poverty-related diseases in Africa and addresses the disparity in representation of Africans in cancer clinical trials. Janssen Oncology\u2019s support for AAI began in 2022 with the initial assessment of access to cancer care in 10 hospitals in five African countries, patient education and community awareness programs, as well as training programs for more than 2,000 HCPs on cancer diagnosis and treatment.\n\nJanssen Oncology provided a $5 million grant to Stand Up To Cancer, a nonprofit organization supporting cancer research, to support the development of innovative approaches to removing barriers to clinical trial participation for patients of all racial and ethnic backgrounds, as well as patients in medically under-resourced communities.\n\nAs one of the leading funders in cancer research, Stand Up To Cancer believes it is critical to ensure that the lack of diverse representation in cancer clinical trials is addressed. This is a national imperative that we cannot turn away from. We need fresh ideas that help to innovate and redesign the cancer clinical research enterprise to include communities that have long been left out.\n\nRussell Chew\nPresident and CEO, Stand Up To Cancer\n\nJanssen Oncology provided a grant of $3 million to the American Cancer Society to fund its Navigating Patients Across the Care and Treatment Continuum program. Janssen\u2019s contribution will support collaboration with 20 health systems over three years, enhancing the oncology patient experience and addressing barriers to enrollment for underrepresented or marginalized communities.\n\nAccelerating diversity in MedTech research: J&J MedTech is taking steps to improve meaningful representation in clinical studies leading to better products and better outcomes. In 2022, we developed our policy position on Diversity in Research & Clinical Trials (U.S.) outlining our call for policies that reduce barriers to participation. We also continue to support the \u2018Diversifying Investigations Via Equitable Research Studies for Everyone (DIVERSE) Trials Act\u2019, introduced in the U.S. House and Senate in 2021, which provides expanded legal authority for companies to diversify their clinical trials. As a founding sponsor of MedTech Color, J&J MedTech helps advance the representation of persons of color in the medtech industry.\nConsumer Health\n\nIn 2021, we announced our intention to separate Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Consumer Health business and to create a new publicly traded company that would take its place as a leader at the intersection of healthcare and consumer goods.\n\nThe new company, named Kenvue, is committed to helping consumers realize the extraordinary power of everyday care. At Kenvue, combining the power of science with meaningful human insights and digital-first capabilities empowers more than one billion people to live healthier lives every day. Kenvue\u2019s portfolio of iconic brands is built for moments that uniquely matter to consumers and drives positive health outcomes around the world.\n\nThibaut Mongon, formerly the Worldwide Chairman, Consumer Health for Johnson & Johnson, serves as Chief Executive Officer of Kenvue. We remain on track to complete the separation in 2023, subject to market conditions.\n\nThe name Kenvue is inspired by two powerful ideas: \u201cken,\u201d meaning knowledge, and \u201cvue,\u201d referencing sight. With rich knowledge of human needs and deep consumer insights, Kenvue will deliver meaningful, personal health solutions.\n\nProgress in advancing our Healthy Lives Mission in 2022 included:\n\nPromoting skin cancer awareness: Neutrogena\u2019s In the Sun in-school program brought skin cancer prevention awareness to more than 150,000 students across the U.S. throughout 2021 and 2022. Following the release of Neutrogena Studios\u2019 award-winning, feature-length documentary film, In the Sun, in 2021 to elevate awareness and understanding of sun safety and skin cancer for all skin types and colors, more than 2,000 schools have participated in the in-school education program over two years. Feedback from the in-school program amongst school students surveyed is that 56% of students said they will change their sun safety habits as a result of watching the film.\n\nGlobally in 2020, more than 1.5 million cases of skin cancers were reported. 52 Globally in 2022, more than 1.5 million cases of skin cancers were diagnosed and more than 120,000 skin cancer-associated deaths were reported. 53\n\nSupporting smoking cessation: NICORETTE brought the first nicotine replacement therapy to market more than 40 years ago and\u2014backed by more than 50 years of research and innovation\u2014remains committed to eradicating smoking. In 2022, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Health continued to support smoking cessation by joining the launch event of the WHO Tobacco Cessation Consortium. The Consortium is a public-private coalition to support the WHO\u2019s work on tobacco cessation worldwide. Our participation in this consortium builds on NICORETTE\u2019s previous support of the WHO\u2019s Access Initiative to Quit Tobacco, which delivered positive results in terms of smokers who quit completely. NICORETTE has donated more than $1.5 million worth of NICORETTE patches to help people quit smoking.\n\nOnly 30% of the world\u2019s 1.3 billion tobacco users have access to the tools to help them to quit successfully. 54\n\nAdvocating for menstrual dignity: In 2022, STAYFREE joined UNICEF for another year to promote education about menstrual hygiene and address menstrual poverty in Brazil.\n\nMore than 11 million people are directly affected by menstrual poverty in Brazil, and 94% of low-income women do not know what menstrual poverty is. 55 Access to menstrual hygiene is a public health issue, as well as a human rights issue, according to the UN. 56 Many women, especially those in low-income regions, live in menstrual poverty, which means lack of basic access to buy hygiene products and often lack of access to water and sanitation. In 2022, STAYFREE joined UNICEF for another year to address menstrual poverty in Brazil. Between 2021 and 2022, STAYFREE donated two sanitation pads in menstrual hygiene kits distributed by UNICEF to 45,000 teenagers in Brazil and supported educational outreach widely across the country. Also, in India, STAYFREE continued its \u201cIt\u2019s just a period\u201d campaign to normalize the topic of menstruation in India, leveraging Daughters Day for a second year as an occasion to destigmatize the first period experience, especially in many households where menstruation is still considered taboo, by educating and involving other family members for support.\n\n52 WHO, \u201cUltraviolet radiation,\u201d https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ultraviolet-radiation, accessed February 2023. 53 WHO, \u201cWHO Director-General approves tobacco cessation consortium,\u201d https://www.who.int/news/item/05-11-2021-tobacco-cessation-consortium, accessed February 2023. 54 According to research commissioned by STAYFREE, in partnership with the Kyra Institute and MosaicLab, 2021. 55 UN WOMEN, \u201cTowards gender equality through sanitation access,\u201d https://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2016/3/towards-gender-equality-through-sanitation-access, accessed February 2023.\nExpanding product transparency for consumers: Johnson & Johnson Consumer Health expanded its product transparency dashboard across several of our leading Consumer Health brands, helping empower consumers to make informed choices about the personal care products they use and rely on. Our transparency dashboard for consumers, launched in 2021, includes product-specific information about ingredients, science and sustainability to meet consumer needs. In 2022, we expanded the product transparency dashboard across several of our Consumer Health brands, tailoring information to the needs of consumers on a brand-by-brand basis. JOHNSON\u2019S Baby also unveiled this dashboard in leading global markets outside the U.S., namely Brazil, Canada and the UK.\n\nImproving packaging sustainability: We are advancing our Healthy Lives Mission by taking important steps to reduce the environmental impact of our personal care product packaging by using less virgin plastic and increasing our use of recycled materials while improving the recyclability and reusability of our packaging. These efforts align with our Consumer Health Packaging targets and support our participation as a signatory to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation\u2019s New Plastics Economy Global Commitment.\n\nIn alignment with our target to eliminate 100% of polystyrene jars and black plastic bottles from our global portfolio, we ceased sourcing packaging components with this resin material in 2022. In addition, we improved the sustainability of several products and packaging, including:\n\n- LISTERINE and OGX introduced innovative product formats, including mouthwash concentrates and shampoo bars, that reduce the need for packaging.\n- AVEENO, NEUTROGENA, JOHNSON\u2019s Baby and LE PETIT MARSEILLAIS launched reuse and refill solutions to reduce plastic use compared to existing packaging.\n- o.b. introduced organic tampons made with 100% certified organic cotton and are 100% plastic free from top to string.\n- CAREFREE launched Organic Cotton Topsheet Liners with 100% certified organic cotton topsheet.\n\nSeveral brands in our portfolio also increased the use of PCR plastic packaging materials and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC\u00ae)-certified paperboard.\n\nCollaborating for greater impact: Johnson & Johnson Consumer Health collaborates with industry peers, NGOs and suppliers to advance our sustainability and transparency objectives. Some of our partnerships and collaborations in 2022 included:\n\n- The Animal-Free Safety Assessment (AFSA) Collaboration is a forum that brings the collective voice of nonprofit and industry leaders together in support of education and advocacy to help eliminate the need for animal testing for cosmetics.\n- The EcoBeautyScore Consortium, an industry-led collaboration of more than 60 companies and associations to help consumers understand the environmental impact of cosmetic and personal care products through the launch of an environmental scoring system for cosmetic products to help inform consumer purchasing decisions.\n- More than 160 companies and organizations across the packaging value chain, as part of the Digital Watermarks Initiative HolyGrail 2.0, plan to assess whether a pioneering digital watermarking technology can enable better sorting and higher-quality recycling rates for packaging in the EU.\n\nAdditionally, to advance a circular economy and packaging sustainability, we continued our collaboration with several organizations, including the Consumer Goods Forum\u2019s Plastics Waste Coalition of Action, the Closed Loop Infrastructure Fund and the A*STAR Institute of Materials Research and Engineering Circular Materials Lab, helping to develop new global industry design rules for sustainable packaging, expand the recycling infrastructure in North America and research circular flexible film packaging solutions respectively.

We promote a culture of respect, inclusion and excellence, inspired by Our Credo, so that the talent of every individual at Johnson & Johnson can be leveraged to ensure our Company, our communities and our environment, and each of us as individuals, can thrive and grow.\n\nOur employees at Johnson & Johnson around the world continue to be energized by Our Purpose to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. Every single one of our employees can make a difference\u2014and with approximately 153,700 individuals in all corners of the globe\u2014that adds up to a huge impact.\n\nEmployee attraction\n\nOur recruitment efforts include outreach through a wide range of channels and partners to encourage a diverse representation of top qualified candidates. Employee referrals again generated a significant proportion of our hiring efforts, demonstrating employee confidence in Johnson & Johnson as an attractive workplace. Other areas of progress related to employee attraction and development in 2022 included:\n\n- Inspiring people to return to work after a career break: Re-Ignite is Johnson & Johnson\u2019s global career reentry program that offers experienced professionals who have taken a break from their career for two or more years the opportunity to return to the workforce with specialized onboarding, networking and development activities. In addition to its ambition to support women in returning to STEM professions, Re-Ignite is a gender-inclusive program that, in 2022, officially expanded its focus to include returning professionals both in and outside of STEM roles.\n\nSince its inception in 2017, Re-Ignite enabled professionals in 13 countries across all four regions to return to the Johnson & Johnson workplace where they can continue their careers in meaningful roles.\n\nBy anticipating and developing critical capabilities across Johnson & Johnson, we can help accelerate business outcomes today and further future-proof our organization for any tomorrow. To do this effectively, we must create meaningful, personalized learning experiences that help shape highly capable leaders and empower our employees to chart individualized career paths that feed Our Purpose and theirs.\n\nPeter Fasolo Ph.D.\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Human Resources Officer, Johnson & Johnson\n\nIn 2022, our direct global workforce included approximately 153,700 individuals. This includes approximately 25,000 new hires across our different regions, of whom 54% were women.\n\nGlobal Workforce by Region\n\n- Asia Pacific: 51,829\n- Europe, Middle East & Africa: 31,322\n- Latin America: 26,053\n- North America: 44,473\n\nNew Employee Hires by Region (%)\n\n- Asia Pacific: 33.2%\n- Europe, Middle East & Africa: 25.2%\n- Latin America: 22.3%\n- North America: 19.4%\n\nEmployee attraction\n\nOur recruitment efforts include outreach through a wide range of channels and partners to encourage a diverse representation of top qualified candidates.

In a sense, we are a hidden workforce. Re-Ignite provided the support structures I needed to help me adjust to returning to the workplace. After participating in the program, I found that I slotted back into the work environment; it was like I never left. This was very empowering. I felt relevant and that I hadn\u2019t lost my skills.\n\nBarbara McCarthy\nSite PMO Manager, Johnson & Johnson Vision\n\n* Abiomed headcount is excluded from Global Employee data, as well as other employee and DEI-related disclosures. ** Values have been rounded to the nearest tenth. Due to rounding, the numbers presented do not add up precisely to the totals provided, and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.\nHiring military veterans: Alongside our appreciation for their valued service, we appreciate the unique skills and experience military veterans and military spouses bring to our business. We engage with government bodies and veteran support organizations to expand our hiring pathways for military veterans, and we offer veteran development programs to support transitioning to civilian life and work. In 2022, we made strong progress as an employer of choice for the military community:\n\n- Enhanced and expanded hiring and development opportunities through our sales and leadership programs. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Military Veteran Leadership Development program, launched in 2017, has maintained 100% retention across all cohorts, totaling more than 40 veterans.\n- Hired veterans through the Department of Defense SkillBridge program, which provides transitioning military service members with civilian work experience during their final six months in service. As part of this program, Johnson & Johnson offers internships to SkillBridge participants, and, in 2022, we completed our first full annual cycle of hiring, during which 90% of SkillBridge interns became Johnson & Johnson full-time employees.\n- Reaffirmed our commitment to veteran and military spouse hiring through the Veteran Jobs Mission, a coalition that brings together hundreds of leading companies to actively hire veterans.\n\nAdvancing leadership development: We developed leadership skills at every level and career stage through on-demand content and innovative and personalized modules across our suite of leadership development programs, with many thousands of employees at all levels.\n\nLearning and development\n\nWe continue to invest heavily in a wide variety of learning and development programs that help employees realize their career goals while building a capable and resilient workforce for the future. Some examples from 2022 follow:\n\nDelivering a new learning ecosystem: We launched J&J Learn, a global learning and development platform that integrates the curricula from our multiple learning organizations across the Enterprise, including leadership development programs, Human Performance Institute programs and more, to become the single source for all learning and development needs. By leveraging the latest technology, including AI, J&J Learn delivers a streamlined learning experience that is easy to access and navigate and enables every employee to incorporate learning into their daily practices while creating the career path that is right for them. J&J Learn includes learning programs, facilitates matching with mentors and holistic career review and development planning tools.\n\nBy embracing a learning mindset\u2014both for ourselves and for our teams\u2014we will be better able to anticipate and develop the critical capabilities needed to accelerate business outcomes and future-proof our organization while also providing rewarding career opportunities that allow employees to realize and pursue their unique purpose and aspirations.\n\nSandra Humbles\nChief Learning Officer, Johnson & Johnson\n\nLearn more about all our people development resources in our Position on Employee Development.\n\nWe also completed our most significant people leader assessment of all time, with more than 7,500 people leaders receiving a report providing valuable feedback on their people leadership skills that will support their ongoing development and further empower them to help our organization deliver on its critical objectives.\n\nLearning and Development in 2022 by the Numbers*\n\n- $112 million total spend on employee learning and development\n- 1,185 employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico participated in the tuition reimbursement program\n- 1,832 new leaders participated in our Enterprise Leader Development Program\n- 46% of Managers and above moved across functions, country or business segment lines, building diversity of experiences*\n- 100% of employees completed year-end performance reviews\n- 9% voluntary turnover rate\n\n* Career progression movement includes upward promotion and lateral transfer and excludes employees in the R&D organizations.\nBuilding digital capabilities: To support the ever-expanding use of digital technologies and data science in almost every aspect of our work in every function of the business, we are heavily investing in building broad digital capabilities for our workforce. To focus our efforts and provide a common learning experience across Johnson & Johnson, we launched our Digital Upskilling Channel supported by \u201cdigital missions,\u201d which are learning activations comprising various learning formats such as synchronous and asynchronous learning, quizzes and articles around one specific digital capability, that provide teams with an effective, experiential learning opportunity. We supported this innovative approach with a playbook for local activation of digital missions. Additionally, Johnson & Johnson employees continued to access our iTalk Digital Education Series, developed by our Technology Division to teach digital topics with 130 iTalk videos available to all employees.\n\nCompensation and benefits\n\nOur compensation framework, which is consistent worldwide, includes a set of core principles that guide all compensation decisions, recognizing the important contributions of our employees to deliver our mission in ways that align with our values. We are committed to pay equity, including gender and ethnic/racial group pay equity.\n\nPeriodically, we analyze our pay across functions to assess market competitiveness and to eliminate unconscious bias or other barriers to full pay equity across the Enterprise. In 2022, we invested significantly in targeted salary increases in several countries to enhance our competitive pay position; this was also influenced by inflationary pressures, and part of our analysis this year used a new framework to monitor inflation and highlight areas for further alignment. In addition, we increased our investment in employees across our Total Health portfolio to address rising rates of mental health concerns and ongoing uncertainties or consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that our investment in employees across the spectrum of compensation and benefits helps make Johnson & Johnson both more attractive as an employer and more resilient as a business.\n\nAdditionally, we completed our annual living wage assessment with the aim of ensuring all employees globally receive pay that is competitive in their local markets and sufficient to support a sustainable standard of living for them and their families (see section: Human Rights).\n\nEnhancing hybrid working: We continued to implement our hybrid working model, J&J Flex, globally, capturing the energy of in-person interactions and remote flexibility. In the supply chain, flexibility offerings for on-site employees were established that combine locally relevant practices with a globally consistent hybrid working framework at each site. This new approach was used, for example, to remotely onboard thousands of supply chain team members, who also completed a portion of their total required training assignments online.\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion advances our culture of belonging where open hearts and minds combine to unleash the potential of the brilliant mix of people working everywhere at Johnson & Johnson today, as well as those who will join us in the future.\n\nWe take a strategic approach to driving DEI at Johnson & Johnson, based on our mission and vision and DEI strategy that is designed to do the following:\n\n- Build a workforce that reflects the diversity of our communities.\n- Accelerate our global culture of inclusion where every individual belongs.\n- Transform talent and business processes to achieve equitable access and outcomes for all.\n- Drive innovation and growth within our business to serve diverse markets around the world.\n\nDEI is fundamentally embedded in our human resources strategies and our Health for Humanity 2025 Goals:\n\n- Progress in Women in Management\n  - 49% of management positions globally are held by women.\n\n- Progress in Ethnic/Racial Diversity in Management\n  - 36% of management positions in the U.S. are held by ethnic/racially diverse employees.\n\n- Progress in Black/African Americans in Management\n  - Achieved a growth of 40.5% in Black and African American management positions from 2020, with Black and African American employees representing 6.6% of management positions in the U.S.\n\nWe cannot overstate the positive impact that diverse voices bring to our organizational culture, our community and society at large. But challenges remain.

We provide platforms, tools and resources across the Enterprise to help everyone contribute effectively.\n\nWe encourage open and inclusive communications so that everyone feels welcome to offer ideas and suggestions about how we can improve outcomes for patients and consumers and demonstrate care for our communities and our planet.\n\nConnecting to our employees: One of the platforms we use to track employee sentiment and feeling of being connected to our colleagues and our values is our biennial Our Credo Survey, which was administered in 2022 in 77 countries and made available in 36 languages. Over the past two years, people around the globe have faced and overcome many social and economic challenges, including those relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the face of these challenges, employees have maintained their confidence in Our Credo values, demonstrating stronger support and recognition for the way we uphold our values and positively impact society.\n\nFollowing an analysis of the detailed results, which were communicated to all employees, we developed plans to address the main areas of opportunity identified by our employees\u2019 feedback, both at the Enterprise level and within individual teams.\n\nIn alternate years, we conduct a global Our Voice Survey, which serves as an indicator of employee satisfaction and measures important aspects of our culture such as employee engagement, inclusion, development, health and wellness, collaboration, execution, innovation, and compliance and risk.\n\nRecognizing employees: In addition to several awards and honors programs that recognize the contributions of our employees across different functions and regions, we maintain our global peer recognition platform, Inspire, which reaches all of our global workforce in 77 countries. In 2022, hundreds of thousands of recognition moments celebrated meaningful contributions and purpose-led behaviors among our employees.\n\nWomen in STEM\n\nWe aim to encourage girls to consider science, technology, engineering, mathematics, manufacturing and design (STEM\u00b2D) studies and career opportunities in the knowledge that advancing gender equality in technical professions will both strengthen society and also build a stronger pipeline of diverse talent in under-resourced STEM\u00b2D-related professions, critical to advancing innovation in healthcare.\n\nThrough our Health for Humanity 2025 Goals, which include a specific target to reach 2 million girls through STEM\u00b2D activities led by Johnson & Johnson employees in partnership with nonprofit organizations, we encourage our employees to play an active role in engaging to advance women in science.\n\nIn 2022, more than 1,500 Johnson & Johnson employee volunteers directly engaged in STEM\u00b2D activities with approximately 170,000 girls.\n\nOur Women in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, Manufacturing and Design (WiSTEM\u00b2D) initiative supports youth, undergraduates, scholars and professionals and has been active since 2015. Through our WiSTEM\u00b2D Youth Pillar, we seek to spark enchantment with STEM\u00b2D in young women and girls all around the globe through creative problem-solving and play.\nIn our WiSTEM\u00b2D Undergraduate program, we collaborated with nearly 70 universities, delivering more than 140 events and reaching more than 23,000 university students via a variety of activities and social media campaigns. We also launched a WiSTEM\u00b2D Camp, a weeklong pilot program in Europe, to give students an opportunity to explore post-secondary options in STEM\u00b2D fields, an initiative we plan to extend to 2023. Further, we expanded our WiSTEM\u00b2D program in our APAC and Latin America regions.\n\nIn our WiSTEM\u00b2D Scholars program, we again selected six outstanding female researchers to receive support to drive their important research. This program has been active since 2017, selecting early to mid-career women faculty researchers, who have completed their post-doctoral studies and are making key STEM\u00b2D discoveries, to each receive a grant of $150,000 and three years of mentorship. In 2022, we received more than 500 applications from highly qualified nominees from around the world, with more than 75% of applicants coming from outside the U.S. The selected WiSTEM\u00b2D 2022 scholars are advancing pivotal global innovations across diverse fields with an aim to significantly improve healthcare outcomes.

This program is part of Our Race to Health Equity commitment (see section: Our Race to Health Equity).\nEngaging employees for a healthy planet\n\nJohnson & Johnson employees are passionate about environmental sustainability and seek to make an impact. We engage, inspire and provide opportunities for employees to learn and collaborate through dedicated environmental sustainability programs and learning and idea-sharing platforms such as WeSustain, HealthyPlanet and environmental sustainability training.\n\nWeSustain: Our environmental sustainability employee engagement program, WeSustain, mobilizes passionate employees to improve environmental health in locations where we live, work and sell our products. In 2022, we brought the WeSustain community together for the first Global WeSustain Summit. Employees globally joined a virtual live event to hear from internal and external speakers, connect with each other and share ideas for a more sustainable future.\n\nHealthyPlanet: In 2022, through our HealthyPlanet platform launched in 2020, we challenged employees to calculate their environmental sustainability impact by offering a personal carbon calculator and ideas to reduce their footprint. Throughout the year, employees completed more than 40,000 actions on topics ranging from reducing energy, lessening food waste and eliminating single-use plastics. Incentives, like charitable donations, drove employees to take over double the actions taken in the previous year. Impact metrics from HealthyPlanet illustrated employee-led savings, including reduced paper use, reduced trash, lower energy consumption and lower water use.\n\nEmployee training in environmental sustainability: In 2022, we built an online self-paced training module, called \u201cSustainability & My Job,\u201d to demonstrate how every Johnson & Johnson employee can contribute to sustainability solutions at work. This follows the broader foundational sustainability training module launched in 2021. The new training depicts real employee examples and guides employees to build their own action plan based on their role and function. Interest in both optional sustainability training modules has been strong from employees around the world.\n\nDeb Gorhan\nDirector, Sustainability Culture & Engagement, Johnson & Johnson\n\nWe are continuously providing opportunities for our employees to learn and build their personal and professional sustainability capabilities so that decisions made today will help protect the environment and the health of future generations.\nEmployee Health, Safety & Well-Being\n\nAt Johnson & Johnson, we take an uncompromising approach to safety in everything we do. We also invest extensively in the health and well-being of our employees; we believe that advancing health for humanity starts with protecting and enhancing the total health\u2014physical, mental, emotional and financial\u2014of our workforce.\n\nWe aim to ensure that all our employees around the world, as well as temporary contractors and visitors to our sites, can work safely. Our workplace health and safety programs include adherence to our robust global safety standards, risk assessments, extensive training and communications. We continuously expand health and well-being benefits throughout Johnson & Johnson globally, incorporating new thinking and technologies to help employees achieve their personal mind and body health goals.\n\nTo reinforce best safety practices, in 2022, we commenced a yearlong global refresher program of our Six Safety Habits framework for all employees in our R&D spaces and supply chain facilities\u2014and those working on construction projects\u2014to reacquaint them with the workplace habits that ensure safety continues to be an essential part of our culture.\n\nOur Six Safety Habits\n\nLearning\nWe learn from both our successes and our failures.\n\nCaring\nWe demonstrate caring and inspire a strong value of safety from the heart.\n\nProactive\nEveryone anticipates and actively engages in controlling safety hazards.\n\nResponsible\nEveryone is personally responsible for their safety and the safety of others.\n\nTransparent\nEveryone feels safe to make suggestions and/or share complaints with those who need to know.\n\nInclusive\nWe seek diverse perspectives and share safety knowledge within and beyond our four walls.\n\nEnsuring people can work safely is foundational to their well-being. In fact, nothing is more important. However, we must continue to remain vigilant. With so many facilities and operations around the world, presenting potential safety risks every minute of every day, we rely on our approximately 153,700 people, as well as contractors and visitors to our sites, to practice safe working in every single one of those minutes.\n\nJohan Geerinck\nWorldwide Vice President, Environmental Health & Safety, Johnson & Johnson\n\nOur Global Employee Safety (%)*\n\n|                      | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|----------------------|------|------|------|\n| Lost Workday Case Rate | 0.05 | 0.05 | 0.06 |\n| Serious Injury and Illness Case Rate | 0.03 | 0.02 | 0.03 |\n| Total Recordable Injury Rate | 0.24 | 0.27 | 0.23 |\n\n* See the Employee Safety table in the ESG Performance Data section of this Report for footnote considerations related to Global Employee Safety data.\nAdvancing road safety: Road safety is a key element of our safe working programs, and we continuously seek to improve the safety of our vehicles and, even more importantly, the awareness, vigilance and safe practices of our drivers. In 2022, we took several actions to further improve our driver and fleet safety globally:\n\n- expanded predictive analytics for the majority of our global fleet drivers;\n- digitized both global road safety data with online at-a-glance dashboards for effective safety controls and management and also our road safety assurance and audit process;\n- standardized our global road safety training on our internal online training platform, accessible to all fleet drivers; and\n- distributed a highly reflective inflatable airbag vest to all riders of two-wheeled power vehicles in India to reduce risk of potential injury.\n\nSince 2012, Johnson & Johnson has donated more than 75,000 lifesaving helmets to children in Vietnam.\n\nBeyond safety, we aspire to have the healthiest workforce, inspiring us to continually examine and expand our total health benefits, programs and offerings to support the total well-being of all employees and embed a culture of health throughout Johnson & Johnson. Our healthiest workforce ambition is tracked in our Health for Humanity 2025 Goals annual Healthiest Workforce Score.\n\nThe comprehensive well-being portfolio available to Johnson & Johnson employees and their families is reflected in the positive employee perception of organizational support for their total health. In 2022, most global employees believed senior leaders support their health and well-being, as exemplified by the Our Credo Survey results.\n\nIn 2022, we again improved our health benefits and programs to support employee health and well-being and rolled out several new initiatives to enhance our robust portfolio of well-being offerings, including:\n\n- Implemented expanded paid parental leave benefits for employees around the world, with 12 weeks of paid leave covering maternal, paternal, adoptive, surrogacy-assisted and foster parents.\n\nGlobal Activity Challenge: In 2022, we held our seventh 30-day Global Activity Challenge, encouraging our employees to join teams to boost their health by getting moving. Employees were able to select walking, running, dancing, cycling, gardening, practicing yoga or other preferred physical activity, competing against other global teams. The 2022 Challenge engaged more than 33,000 participants in 73 countries, recording more than 7.5 billion steps throughout the Challenge. At the end of the Challenge, Johnson & Johnson donated $50,000 each to Operation Smile and UNICEF.\n\nEnergy management: Our enterprise-wide ENERGY FOR PERFORMANCE program helps employees manage their energy capacity so that they can be their best at work and in life. We have consistently expanded the use of this program and introduced virtual courses to continue to deliver this important training during the pandemic. In 2022, 8,872 employees completed ENERGY FOR PERFORMANCE courses.\nA LEED Gold-certified Janssen facility completed the second phase of a photovoltaic (PV) panel installation in 2022.\nClimate Action\n\nAt Johnson & Johnson, we understand that human health and environmental health are fundamentally linked\u2014healthy people need a healthy planet. For more than two decades, we have set and achieved carbon reduction goals. We have taken sustained, long-term action to reduce our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and we are encouraging our suppliers to do the same.\n\nAs the largest, most diversified healthcare products company, we recognize our opportunity to drive positive change on issues that affect the health of the people we serve. We continually strive to improve the environmental footprint of our operations, our products and our value chain while also working with others to accelerate and scale solutions. And together with like-minded partners, we are working to tackle today\u2019s global challenges at the intersection of human and environmental health, including climate change and health equity.\n\nAccording to the WHO, climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity, and climate-sensitive health risks are disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable and disadvantaged.56\n\nJohnson & Johnson has set three public goals to reduce GHG emissions across our value chain. Our near-term goal to reduce Scope 1 + Scope 2 GHG emissions by 60% from 2016 levels, is validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as being consistent with the reductions required to keep global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nJohnson & Johnson was recognized with a CDP A List rating in 2022 for our leadership in climate action for the fifth consecutive year, one of just 297 companies to be named to the Climate A List in 2022.\n\nWe take an intentional approach to climate action in order to benefit the health of our planet, the health of our company, and the health of people, including those who are disproportionately impacted by the effects of rising temperatures, extreme weather events and climate-sensitive health risks. In addition to progress towards our climate goals, we are working with partners to strengthen the climate resilience of the healthcare workforce and healthcare systems that serve those most vulnerable to the health impacts of a changing climate.\n\nPaulette Frank\nChief Sustainability Officer,\nJohnson & Johnson\n\nSince 2016, our absolute Scope 1 + Scope 2 GHG emissions have reduced by 41% (absolute reduction), from 1,166,456 MT CO\u2082e in 2016 to 683,188 MT CO\u2082e in 2022.\n\nScope 1 + 2 GHG Emissions (MT CO\u2082e)*\n\n| Year | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| 1,166,456 | 1,085,385 | 1,058,659 | 968,830 | 742,895 | 753,270 | 683,188 |\n\n* See the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions table in the ESG Performance Data section of this Report for footnote considerations related to Scope 1 + Scope 2 GHG emissions data.\n\n56 WHO, \u201cClimate change and health,\u201d https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health, accessed February 2023.\nAccelerating our use of renewable electricity\n\nWe are making meaningful progress in deploying renewable electricity across a greater portion of our operations around the world, with 67% of our global electricity use powered by renewables at the end of 2022.\n\nOur global expansion of the use of renewable electricity and execution of virtual PPAs and green tariffs has been a significant factor in reducing our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, in line with our goal to achieve carbon neutrality for our operations by 2030.\n\nIn 2022, we completed several initiatives to procure renewable electricity globally, propelling Johnson & Johnson toward our 100% renewable electricity goal at the global level by 2025. These initiatives included:\n\n- **Brazil:** A direct PPA was signed for 100% renewable electricity from a wind farm in northern Brazil for all Johnson & Johnson operations in the country starting in 2023. This is the largest deal we\u2019ve made in South America to date.\n- **India:** A direct PPA was signed in Mulund, India, that will enable the Mulund Consumer Health plant to source some of its electricity from wind power in 2023.\n- **Australia, China and South America:** Multiple Utility Green Tariffs were completed for renewable electricity across several sites.\n- **Mexico:** A direct PPA from a wind farm in Mexico helps deliver part of Ethicon\u2019s Juarez site with renewable electricity, as of September 2022.\n- **Malaysia, South Africa and Spain:** Expansion of on-site solar power generation was completed at three Consumer Health sites.\n\nMinimizing GHG emissions through our operations and products\n\nIn addition to accelerating our use of renewable energy, we continue to invest in energy-efficient processes and equipment, green construction and lower-carbon renovations at our sites.\n\nSince 2005, energy efficiency programs at our most energy-intensive manufacturing and R&D sites are allocated up to $40 million per year in capital relief through our CO\u2082 Capital Relief Program, for energy projects that demonstrate potential CO\u2082 savings and a financial return of at least 15%.\n\nFor example, Janssen\u2019s Xi\u2019an facility in China completed the second phase of photovoltaic (PV) panel installation as part of the CO\u2082 Capital Relief Program, integrating it into its existing system.\nIn 2022, five Johnson & Johnson sites in France (S\u00e9zanne), Germany (Wuppertal), Italy (Pomezia), Switzerland (Neuch\u00e2tel) and the U.S. (Lititz, Pennsylvania) were newly certified CarbonNeutral\u00ae by the external organization Climate Impact Partners, bringing our total number of certified CarbonNeutral sites to six, including Helsingborg, Sweden, originally certified in 2017. Carbon emissions reductions were achieved through energy efficiency initiatives, such as HVAC optimization and chiller system replacements, waste-to-energy projects and renewable electricity use. Carbon credits and carbon offsets were utilized for remaining emissions.\n\nReducing energy consumption: Overall, between 2016 (our base year for the Health for Humanity 2025 Environmental Goals) and 2022, we reduced our total energy consumption by 8%, while our business grew by 32% in the same period. In other words, our energy intensity, expressed as TJ per $ billion in sales to customers, reduced by 30%, strongly demonstrating the cumulative effect of continuous improvement and deliberate energy efficiency initiatives, year after year, across our global operations.\n\nSince 2016, our total absolute energy consumption across all Johnson & Johnson sites has reduced by 8%, from 12,811 TJ in 2016 to 11,800 TJ in 2022. This represents 30% energy reduction on an intensity basis, per $ billion in sales.\n\nTotal Energy Use Since 2016 (TJ)*\n\n| Year | From non-renewable sources | From renewable sources |\n|------|---------------------------|------------------------|\n| 2016 | 12,811                    | 178                    |\n| 2022 | 11,800                    | 124                    |\n\nEnergy Intensity Since 2016 (TJ/$ Billion)*\n\n| Year | 2016 | 2022 |\n|------|------|------|\n|      | 178  | 124  |\n\nGreen buildings: We continue to pursue Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) certification or equivalents (such as Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology [BREEAM]). In 2022, we added one LEED certification across our facilities, bringing our total at the end of 2022 to 68 LEED-certified and BREEAM-certified Johnson & Johnson sites.\n\nApproximately 9.4 million square feet of Johnson & Johnson workspace is LEED-certified.\n\nGreen labs: In 2022, our J&J MedTech DePuy Synthes R&D lab in Leeds, UK, and our Janssen Immunology lab in California, both achieved \u201cMy Green Lab\u00ae\u201d certification for implementing sustainability best practices. My Green Lab certification is recognized by the UN Race to Zero campaign as a key measure of progress toward a zero-carbon future and is considered the gold standard for laboratory sustainability best practices around the world. We intend to seek certification for more Johnson & Johnson labs in the coming year.\nDriving carbon reductions across our value chain\n\nEngaging with our key suppliers across our global supply base is critical to reducing our absolute upstream Scope 3 GHG emissions in line with our Health for Humanity 2025 Goal of 20% reduction by 2030 (from 2016 levels).\n\nTo make progress in this area, our procurement and logistics teams worked closely to identify and realize opportunities to improve our Scope 3 data and drive emissions reductions. We introduced a new Upstream Scope 3 strategy that encompasses:\n\n- **Building capability:** We are helping to educate suppliers on emissions measurement and disclosure, as well as renewable energy adoption. We have also trained our procurement teams to support high-quality data submission by suppliers to CDP.\n- **Driving reductions:** We are piloting a Joint Climate Action Planning process with high-emitting suppliers across various industries to help us understand their climate goals and efforts needed to achieve them. Through Joint Climate Action Planning, we are able to identify the biggest opportunities to collaborate with suppliers to drive reductions in our Scope 3 emissions.\n\nRegarding logistics, we continued to work with suppliers to reduce shipping-related emissions. For example, in Europe, Johnson & Johnson introduced a \u201crolling highway\u201d project that transports fully loaded trucks by rail between Italy and Belgium, significantly reducing emissions from road travel. This program will be expanded to include more shipments in 2023.\n\nPartnering for climate action\n\nIn 2022, we also engaged with two initiatives to support collective efforts in driving down GHG emissions in pharmaceutical supply chains. These were:\n\n- **The Energize Program:** A pharmaceutical industry collaboration platform with an aim to increase access to renewable electricity within pharmaceutical supply chains and to educate suppliers about renewable energy adoption and contracting. More than 160 Johnson & Johnson suppliers have registered to the platform. In 2022, the Energize program supported its first renewable electricity buyers cohort\u2014a group of companies that came together to contract for renewable electricity at scale via a PPA.\n- **The Activate Program:** A pharmaceutical industry collaboration, launched in 2022, bringing together five pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson & Johnson, as founding members to support active API suppliers in their decarbonization efforts through measurement of their GHG emissions and provision of practical decarbonization tools.\n\nWe continued to engage in partnerships and coalitions to help make a positive impact on the health of our climate beyond our value chain:\n\n- In early 2022, the National Academy of Medicine\u2019s (NAM\u2019s) Action Collaborative on Decarbonizing the U.S. Health Sector, a public-private partnership of leaders from across the health system, began engagement after forming in 2021. The Climate Collaborative is a forum to align around collective goals and actions for decarbonization, based on evidence, shared solutions and a commitment to improve health equity. One of the current work streams of this group focuses on developing and sharing resources to help healthcare supply chain companies start or accelerate their sustainability journeys.\n- In 2022, we were foundational funders of the Beyond the Megawatt Initiative from the Clean Energy Buyers Institute (CEBA), charged with creating a resilient, equitable and environmentally sustainable energy system for the benefit of all by leveraging energy customer demands for clean energy.\n\nWe also work with partners to advance environmental health equity. This includes supporting programs to empower healthcare workers and to strengthen the resilience of healthcare facilities in areas where it\u2019s needed most. Learn more \u2192\n\nTo make progress in this area, our procurement and logistics teams worked closely to identify and realize opportunities to improve our Scope 3 data and drive emissions reductions. We introduced a new Upstream Scope 3 strategy that encompasses:\n\n- **Improving data quality:** We are piloting a collection of more detailed sources of emissions data for our supply base, as well as using our data science capabilities to visualize CDP Supply Chain data that shows the maturity level of our largest-emitting suppliers, including their goals, emissions footprint and reductions.\n\n* See the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions table in the ESG Performance Data section of the Report for footnote considerations related to Scope 3 GHG emissions data.\nWater & Waste Management\n\nWe continue to advance initiatives across our facilities and throughout our supply chain to minimize our impacts on the planet through responsible use of water, avoidance of waste and reduction of waste sent to a landfill.\n\nWater stewardship: As part of our efforts to continuously improve our management of water resources and our water stewardship, we are pursuing Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) certifications across elected facilities in our network. In 2022, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Health Thailand and Janssen\u2019s Xi\u2019an, China, facility both achieved AWS certification. The international AWS certification addresses sustainable water management and is confirmation of having met the global benchmark for responsible water stewardship. We are pursuing additional site certifications in the coming years.\n\nJohnson & Johnson was recognized with a CDP A- rating in 2022 for our leadership in water security.\n\nWater-saving projects in Helsingborg, Sweden: At our Consumer Health site in Helsingborg, Sweden, three new water-saving projects were completed in 2022. A newly installed chiller with a closed-loop water cooling system has reduced coolant water needs by more than half while requiring less energy to operate than the old model. Production equipment cleaning processes were also optimized and shortened to save purified water annually. Finally, an adjustment in the reverse osmosis processes and equipment service methodology was completed, saving additional water on-site.\n\nWaste management: We continually advance initiatives across all our facilities and throughout our supply chain to systematically avoid waste, reduce waste to landfill and increase sustainable management of waste. The waste streams generated directly by our operations include hazardous and non-hazardous waste from research laboratories, manufacturing processes, warehouses and offices. Waste management initiatives progressed in 2022 included:\n\n- Reducing hazardous waste: Our aim is to reduce hazardous waste from material-intensive API processes by implementing green chemistry and engineering principles to improve chemical conversion yields and increasing reuse and recycling of raw materials. For example, in 2022, Janssen continued a program to reduce hazardous waste from our small molecule API production at four Johnson & Johnson sites.\n\n- Working toward zero waste: In Brazil, our teams at the S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos site, which houses manufacturing for all three business segments of Johnson & Johnson, have been working toward improving their waste management program. Since 2020, several initiatives have been put in place to advance recycling across non-hazardous waste streams, and in 2022, the site achieved its highest recycling level since the start of the program, on track to achieve its goal of being a certified TRUE Zero Waste facility. Green Business Certification Inc.\u2019s TRUE Zero Waste certification is a program that rates how well facilities perform in minimizing their non-hazardous, solid wastes and maximizing their efficiency in the use of resources. Several new on-site waste management processes, including a waste inventory management system and internal packaging reuse systems, combined with outreach to suppliers for take-back of packaging items for reuse or recycling, have contributed to a reduction in non-hazardous waste sent to landfill from this facility.\n\nOver the past five years, our water withdrawal in million m\u00b3 per $ billion sales across Johnson & Johnson globally has reduced by 5%, demonstrating efficiencies in water management alongside business growth in sales of 16% between 2018 and 2022.\n\n| Total Water Withdrawn (million m\u00b3) | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|-----------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                                   | 11.64| 11.71| 11.09| 11.04| 11.11|\n\nJohnson & Johnson was recognized with a CDP A- rating in 2022 for our leadership in water security.\nProduct & Packaging Sustainability\n\nWe are committed to developing more sustainable products to support the health of people and our planet. We focus on the product categories, platforms and lifecycle areas with the highest potential impact and prioritize improvements that can be implemented across multiple products.\n\nProduct end-of-life and circularity\n\nWe recognize that the products we create may continue to have environmental impacts after use, and we are working to offer more end-of-life circular solutions. A selection of initiatives in 2022 include:\n\nExpanding surgical device recycling: We expanded our hospital surgical device recycling program, which was piloted in Germany in 2021, to include eight countries in Europe. The program allows hospitals to recycle specific metal and plastic components from Ethicon and Biosense Webster\u2019s single-use instruments while digitally capturing and communicating the environmental impact of salvaging materials such as steel, titanium, aluminum, copper and chrome steel, as well as specific plastics. Components from more than 25,000 single-use products were recycled in 2021 and 2022 through our Hospital Recycling Program.\n\nThe program is also expanding to recover Ethicon\u2019s absorbable suture aluminum-based packaging in countries such as Germany and Switzerland.\n\nExpanding pharmaceutical device take-back: We expanded our U.S. SAFE RETURNS program for home-administered Janssen immunology products to Switzerland. SAFE RETURNS allows patients to return their self-injectable devices using paper envelopes instead of plastic containers once used. A feature of the program is the removal of the hazardous material classification due to the needle-safe authorization, thereby eliminating the need for patients to prepare special paperwork for handling by mainstream postal services. The program is expected to expand to several additional European countries in 2023.\n\nAddressing digital health device waste: Janssen launched and coordinated a new multiyear collaborative initiative, with co-funding through the EU Horizon Europe program, to address the issue of increasing digital health device waste. The initiative, called Digital Health in a Circular Economy (DiCE), brings together 20 organizations in the fields of manufacturing, research, refurbishing, remanufacturing, recycling, social science and policy from nine countries across Europe with an aim to examine the lifecycle of digital health devices from design to end of life, to help extend their lifetime and/or to responsibly manage them at the end of their useful life. Use of digital health devices is predicted to increase rapidly, so a collaborative solution is timely.\n\nReprocessing and recycling of medical devices: To reduce the end-of-life impact of medical device parts in the environment, J&J MedTech reprocessed, single-use devices manufactured by Johnson & Johnson company, Sterilmed, and also offers reprocessed products from other original manufacturers, in line with local laws.\n\nIn 2022, J&J MedTech in the U.S. and Canada:\n\n- Collected 0.78 million medical devices\n- Reprocessed 0.32 million medical devices\n\nAdditionally, J&J MedTech\u2019s Biosense Webster, in collaboration with Sterilmed, expanded its on-site support to collect reprocessable ultrasound catheters, diagnostic catheters and electrophysiology cables to maximize the reprocessing programs in Canada and the U.S. and help health systems support their environmental sustainability objectives.\n\nReducing medical e-waste: J&J MedTech\u2019s Biosense Webster in Brazil implemented an initiative to help hospital staff understand how to change the practice of discarding single-use connector cables used in surgical ablation procedures by safely preparing them for reuse. Biosense Webster cables were designed with exclusive materials to perform in sterile conditions and, when properly sterilized, can be safely reused up to 10 times. By investing in educating hospital staff in sterilization procedures, tons of cables that are discarded annually in Brazil can now be avoided, both reducing waste and equipment expenses for hospitals.\n\nThe SOUNDSTAR Catheter shown here with the reusable eco-cable connection.\n\n59 Recycling varies by country.\nSustainable packaging\n\nAcross our diverse portfolio of products, we are working on multiple opportunities to improve the sustainability of our product packaging. A selection of initiatives in 2022 include:\n\nInvesting in new circular technologies: At Johnson & Johnson, we aim to work with suppliers attempting to find solutions to help divert waste from landfills and to develop technologies that turn diverted waste into new materials. This is why in 2022, Ethicon entered into an agreement with Eastman to purchase Eastman\u2019s Eastar\u2122 Renew 6763 copolyester for its medical device trays. Eastman is a global specialty materials company that produces a broad range of advanced materials, chemicals and fibers found in items people use every day.\n\nBy purchasing Eastman\u2019s Eastar Renew 6763 copolyester, Ethicon is able to attribute a portion of the weight of each tray to materials that Eastman collects for recycling. With each tray, Ethicon helps divert waste from landfills and advances new technology solutions such as Eastman\u2019s molecular recycling technology. We know that a collective approach is essential to tackle today\u2019s greatest environmental challenges. This is an important first step toward advancing the circularity of our healthcare packaging.\n\nUsing recycled packaging for medical devices: J&J MedTech company DePuy Synthes launched more than 250 product items in the SYNFIX Evolution brand in post-consumer recycled (PCR) paperboard material (93%). This PCR packaging replaced white boxes made with 100% virgin paperboard. The new packaging went through extensive testing to confirm that it stands up to our stringent standards for sterility and structural integrity.\n\nReducing and recycling contact lens waste: As part of a commitment to reduce its environmental footprint, Johnson & Johnson Vision removed the plastic pouches on the outside of delivery boxes for all ACUVUE contact lenses in Europe. This change, involving placing delivery notes inside orders without external packaging, will save tons of plastic across Europe every year.\n\nIn the UK, Johnson & Johnson Vision\u2019s ACUVUE Contact Lens Recycle Scheme, launched in 2019, has collected over 8.7 million pairs of contact lenses, blister packs and foils.\n\nCollaborations on sustainable product and packaging: We are members of several organizations that promote sustainable packaging and circularity in our industry, including: The Healthcare Plastics Recycling Council, advancing plastics recyclability in healthcare; The Sustainable Healthcare Coalition, a healthcare sector-led group that inspires sustainable practices in healthcare; and The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), which advances the transition to a circular economy across the pharma value chain as a key pillar of its activity.\n\nLearn more about sustainable packaging solutions in Consumer Health.\n\nGreen chemistry and technology\n\nOur R&D teams continue to integrate principles of green chemistry and engineering to develop our medicines. In 2022, progress included:\n\n- Janssen obtained FDA approval for our inline conditioning process installed at Janssen\u2019s Ireland facility. This process, already approved by the Ireland Health Products Regulatory Authority, was developed by the Janssen R&D team as part of a new manufacturing installation to support a plant expansion. Inline conditioning both saves time and reduces material, waste and energy use throughout the process.\n\n- Janssen improved the efficiency of the manufacturing process of an oligonucleotide API. The API manufacturing process is highly complex and can involve more than 100 linear chemical steps, consuming high quantities of solvents and reagents. Expanded process development and deep understanding of each chemical transformation and its engineering parameters upon scale-up reduced the manufacturing process mass intensity, which resulted in halving the API manufacturing cycle time, as well as lowering manufacturing costs. Without these significant process and yield improvements, patient access to this innovative medicine would have been restrictive both in terms of affordability, as well as annual manufacturing capacity.\n\n- Upstream and downstream process improvements in the manufacturing of REMICADE (infliximab) enabled a significant increase in batch yield, thereby improving the product\u2019s environmental profile. The new REMICADE manufacturing process enables a significant reduction in required batches to deliver the final product, thereby lowering the quantities of raw materials to deliver the same output.\n\nPharmaceuticals in the environment (PIE)\n\nWe play an important role in supporting initiatives to reduce the potential impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the environment. We have a mature and robust program for managing PIE and our position can be found here. Learn more \u2192\n\nProgress in 2022 included:\n\n- We continued our active participation in the industry-led Eco-Pharmaco-Stewardship program, which released the Responsible Manufacturing Effluent Technical Guidance document, used by the industry and Johnson & Johnson to inform how we control the concentrations of APIs that may enter the environment from our manufacturing plants and those of our suppliers.\n\n- As a member of the Antimicrobial Resistance Industry Alliance (AMRIA), we contributed to the publication of the AMRIA Antibiotic Manufacturing Standard: \u201cMinimizing risk of developing antibiotic resistance and aquatic ecotoxicity in the environment resulting from the manufacturing of human antibiotics.\u201d\n\n- We also joined the Innovative Medicines Initiative\u2019s Prioritization and Risk Evaluation of Medicines in the Environment (PREMIER) project consortium, which brings together public and private sector organizations to proactively manage the potential environmental impact of medicines. The initiative aims to design a novel information and assessment system for identifying and addressing environmental risks of medicines to support a new European standard for environmental protection.\nAccountability & Innovation\n\nManufacturing Operator Isabelle V. demonstrates manual intervention on the Seidenader automatic inspection line where syringes are inspected. Photo by Dries Luyten.\nSupply Chain Innovation\n\nInnovation is a critical engine of our long-term business success and a driver of our positive contribution to sustainable development.\n\nAcross Johnson & Johnson, we deliver innovation in multiple ways. In our Pharmaceutical, MedTech and Consumer Health business segments, we combine innovative technologies with leading science to generate transformational solutions across the spectrum of healthcare (see section: Healthcare Innovation). Throughout our global operations and supply chain, we deploy the most advanced technologies, including digital, to support our diverse healthcare portfolio, focusing on quality, reliability and efficiency in bringing our products and treatments to patients to enable better health outcomes. Equally, we advance sustainability through our many technology-driven innovations that support environmental efficiencies in our global supply chain. Examples from 2022 include:\n\n**Embracing advanced technologies:** We are early adopters of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) across our organization. 4IR means deploying digital technologies to make bigger and faster leaps forward in productivity, efficiency, sustainability and enhanced customer service. This approach is recognized by the World Economic Forum (WEF) Global Lighthouse Network that identifies leadership in 4IR technology deployment to transform factories, value chains and business models. Of the 145 Global Lighthouse designations granted by the WEF, Johnson & Johnson is privileged to have 11 Lighthouse designations\u2014more than any other company in the world.\n\n**Johnson & Johnson Lighthouse Designations (as of March 2023)**\n\n- **Janssen, Cork, Ireland:** Received a Sustainability designation for incorporating 4IR technologies into daily manufacturing and supply chain operations, and again in 2022, for using 4IR to advance its sustainability efforts. **Advance Case Management end-to-end business model recognized. Johnson & Johnson partners with customers to manage inventory at the point of consumption in an effort to ensure the right orthopaedic implants for the right patient at the right time.**\n\n- **Vision, Jacksonville, Florida, U.S.:** Received a Sustainability designation for using 4IR to improve reliability, accelerate new product introductions by 33% and enhance cost-effectiveness for customers.\n\n- **DePuy Synthes, Cork, Ireland:** Received a Sustainability designation for using 4IR to improve reliability, accelerate new product introductions by 33% and enhance cost-effectiveness for customers.\n\n- **Consumer Health, Mulund, India:** Adopted AI in quality inspections on LISTERINE filling lines, replacing a manual inspection process. New AI modules on all filling lines learn the visual differences in bottle quality, enabling automatic identification of defective bottles to speed up the production process and reduce waste. Our site can now ship LISTERINE directly from the packing line, more than halving lead times for customers.\n\n- **Consumer Health, Mulund, India:** Deployed 4IR solutions such as demand sensing, smart logistics, robotics and 3D printing to improve reliability, accelerate new product introductions by 33% and enhance cost-effectiveness for customers.\n\n**Improving customer service with machine learning:** We established the Janssen Track & Trace Platform to drive proactive risk management and enhance the customer experience. By using Internet of Things sensors with machine learning, we developed an industry-leading Estimated Arrival Time capability that provides customers with a 10-minute delivery window, an unprecedented level of accuracy in predicting and informing customers when shipments will arrive. This new capability is now live on the Johnson & Johnson Customer Connect website and will be a game changer for personalized medicine and time-sensitive products such as CAR-T technology-based cell therapies (see section: Pharmaceutical R&D), hospital trauma kits and gene therapies.\n\n**Janssen, Cork, Ireland:** Received a Sustainability designation for the use of adaptive process controls to automatically adjust the chiller system for faultless operation and built a digital twin chiller loop that connects the plant with its energy provider, allowing it to share and monitor a single source of data to dramatically reduce the site\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\n**Janssen, Cork, Ireland (2 designations)**\n\n- **Latinia, Italy**\n\n**DePuy Synthes, Cork, Ireland**\n\n- **Suzhou, China**\n\n- **Bridgewater, New Jersey, U.S.**\n\n**Learn more \u2192**\n\n* Janssen\u2019s Cork site in Ireland was designated twice: first, in 2020, for incorporating 4IR technologies into daily manufacturing and supply chain operations, and again in 2022, for using 4IR to advance its sustainability efforts. ** Advance Case Management end-to-end business model recognized. Johnson & Johnson partners with customers to manage inventory at the point of consumption in an effort to ensure the right orthopaedic implants for the right patient at the right time.\n\n**4IR represents a new era of innovation in technology. Building on the digital revolution that preceded it, 4IR is marked by a shift from innovation made possible by artificial intelligence, robotics, autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, the Internet of Things and other breakthrough digital technologies to innovation based on a fusion of these technologies.**\n\n**Gary Hartnett**\n\nVice President, Partnership & External Supply, Janssen Supply Chain\nRevolutionizing our transportation network using real-time tools: Our implementation of a new Johnson & Johnson Global Transportation Control Tower, covering contracted inter-regional air and ocean transport and selected road transportation in our three business segments, has revolutionized transport planning efficiency, shipment visibility in transit and customer confidence in shipment status through real-time communications. The Control Tower, supported by our logistics partner, integrated hundreds of shipping sites, thousands of transportation lanes and dozens of ERP systems to form a single transport planning hub that offers several benefits, including end-to-end visibility of supply chain movements; standardized procedures for shipment booking and management; near-real time performance reporting; spend visibility and freight audit capabilities; and continuous improvements through freight optimization, improved lead times and improved response times.\n\nOptimizing surgical inventories using real-time data: Advance Case Management (ACM), our digitally enabled system to increase perioperative efficiency\u2014a priority for surgery centers and hospitals\u2014was further scaled in 2022 after two years of operation. ACM digitally integrates electronic medical records, surgical schedules and patient health information to inform a proprietary AI-driven algorithm that can accurately predict patient-specific implant and surgical instrument needs based on patient joint sizing, biometrics and surgeon preference. Using ACM, patient- and procedure-specific equipment is supplied to surgery centers and hospitals, enabling them to reduce overall J&J MedTech inventory, minimize operating room setup time and achieve other efficiencies leading to higher equipment availability alongside cost savings. ACM doubled its volume in 2022, supporting surgeons in more than 150 health systems around the U.S. and improving overall patient care.\n\nCreating a smart Hot Room in China: At our J&J MedTech Ethicon Suzhou Plant in China, the new smart Hot Room improves production efficiency, optimizes the production environment and reduces safety risks. Ethicon employees operate the Hot Room using intelligent automation (IA) to complete hot degassing, an important process for suture production. Employees have no need to enter the room at any stage, and by using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging, they can track products end to end in real time, enabling a touchless and accurate supply chain to meet China\u2019s growing demand for surgical sutures.\n\nAutomating new product development and launches: At J&J MedTech, IA is used to create a tailored, robotic document-drafting solution that accelerates new product launch timelines. Previously, J&J MedTech teams submitted thousands of pages of documents to regulators detailing device data and clinical study results when applying for new product authorization and, in many cases, different regulatory bodies require different data. This meant that J&J MedTech technical writers spent weeks reviewing extensive documentation to identify and collate the relevant content for regulatory submissions. With the new tool, machine learning and natural language processing are used to deconstruct documents into structured data sets that automatically populate new documents for submission, requiring only minor manual additions. This process increased efficiency, and has resulted in more concise documents\u2014an additional advantage that reduces turnaround time for the multiple language translations required for each document.\n\nBecause we launch products across several jurisdictions, everything isn\u2019t always called the same thing or in the same order in required regulatory documentation. We needed to create a solution that could use and gain knowledge to determine what data is being requested.\n\nJoshua Samuels\nDirector, Clinical Evaluations, J&J MedTech\n\nThe Global Transportation Control Tower is an important step in our journey to become an agile, digital and unified transportation team across the globe. It accelerates our reach to key markets, reduces our total spend and helps us monitor deliveries in real time to proactively resolve issues before they impact our customers.\n\nNico Sacco\nWorldwide Vice President, Planning, Customer Management and Delivery, Janssen Supply Chain\nResponsible Supply Base\n\nA critically important link in our value chain, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s supplier network underpins our business continuity and enables us to manufacture and deliver essential products and services to our patients, consumers and customers.\n\nGuided by Our Credo values, we aim to maintain collaborative supplier relationships and encourage a broad diversity of suppliers to work with us. Our Responsibility Standards for Suppliers, our Supplier Sustainability Program (SSP) and our Global Supplier Diversity & Inclusion Program are core frameworks that underscore our interactions with suppliers, what we expect of them and how we support them. Through our Partnerships for Good, we encourage our suppliers to join us in developing sustainable solutions to social and environmental challenges.\n\nOur responsible supply base ambitions are reflected in three Health for Humanity 2025 Goals.\n\nThe vital role of a strong supply network is evident to all of us at Johnson & Johnson. The saying \u201cit takes a village\u201d could have been written for our supply chain\u2014although in our case, with tens of thousands of suppliers and Johnson & Johnson employees across the globe, we are talking about a very large village! But the point is clear: We could not achieve our goals without the dedication, collaboration, responsiveness and responsible conduct of all those who are engaged day-in day-out in helping us meet our commitments to our patients through the supply of products, goods, services and technologies to our organization.\n\nKathryn E. Wengel\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Technical Operations & Risk Officer, Johnson & Johnson\n\nSupplier Spend* Contracted by Region (%)\n\n- Asia Pacific: 56%\n- Europe, Middle East & Africa: 32%\n- Latin America: 10%\n- North America: 3%\n\nSupplier Spend* Contracted by Business Segment (%)\n\n- Pharmaceutical: 34%\n- MedTech: 23%\n- Consumer Health: 30%\n- Corporate: 13%\n\n* Represents spend we have control over/addressable spend, defined as products and services that procurement teams can negotiate with suppliers to meet business goals.\nSupplier Engagement\n\nOur supply base is an extension of our business and an important link to our customers around the world. In a large and diverse organization such as Johnson & Johnson, setting clear expectations of suppliers across all aspects of their interactions with us enables the best outcomes for our Company, our suppliers and all those we serve.\n\nSuppliers are critical to our mission of changing the trajectory of health for humanity, and we recognize the broad-based impact these external partners have on our communities. That is why we are committed to working with suppliers who not only provide the highest-quality products and services, but who also share our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion; sustainability; and respecting human rights. By working with suppliers who embrace these imperatives, we can drive even greater benefits for society.\n\nTo help us deliver on the high standards embodied in Our Credo, we seek relationships with suppliers who uphold the principles reflected in our Responsibility Standards for Suppliers. These Standards outline our expectations on a number of important topics and are integral to our supplier-selection process, helping us build a supply base that shares our commitment to strong ethics, quality and global citizenship. The Standards are periodically updated to align with current best practices and our own internal advances. In 2022, we updated our Responsibility Standards for Suppliers, including new sections covering:\n\n- **Supplier Diversity, Equity & Inclusion**: Suppliers are expected to foster a culture of DEI within their own organizations and throughout their own supply bases.\n- **Information Security**: Suppliers are expected to rigorously manage their business activities, employ appropriate information security practices to safeguard data and systems and maintain business continuity.\n- **Environmental Responsibility**: Suppliers are expected to align with expanded requirements covering GHG reductions and the willingness to measure and publicly disclose data; increased focus on energy efficiencies; and integration of biodiversity considerations, recyclability and recycled material use.\n\nWe communicated the new Standards to our suppliers, supported by training and ongoing engagement.\n\nWe aim to work respectfully and collaboratively with all suppliers who engage with Johnson & Johnson. Our Supplier Sustainability Program (SSP) is a key tool to engage selected suppliers, requiring them to conform to our Responsibility Standards for Suppliers and regularly complete an assessment by EcoVadis, a recognized provider of business sustainability ratings for global supply chains. We also encourage transparency among our largest suppliers, encouraging them to publicly disclose their environmental performance, including GHG emissions and water use to CDP.\n\nAssessing and engaging suppliers on social risks: We continued to strengthen our processes and tools to assess, verify and address risks in our supply base as part of our compliance with laws and regulations and to check conformance to the Human and Labor Rights section of our Responsibility Standards for Suppliers. Our human rights in the supply base work included targeted due diligence of existing and potential suppliers, including the use of on-site SMETA (Pillar 4) audits and fuller investigations of potential high-risk commodities and supply chains. We also deployed two tech-enabled risk assessment tools: (i) using AI to gain upstream supply chain visibility of potential high-risk commodities, and (ii) embedding third-party modern slavery metrics in our SSP to assess potential supplier risks.\nBuilding supplier capabilities: In 2022 as part of Onward, Johnson & Johnson Procurement and Sustainability managers, in collaboration with the British Standards Institute, introduced new content to more than 1,000 suppliers in 45 countries. These sessions were designed to focus on specific practical areas for development such as measuring and reporting GHG emissions, starting a supplier diversity program and establishing health and safety policies for employees. Our intention is not only to support our own suppliers so that they can help Johnson & Johnson achieve our goals, but also to help suppliers drive responsible conduct through their own supply chains, resulting in greater efficiency, resilience and sustainable practice for a wide supply network. Since launch, the Onward sessions have had more than 1,300 attendees from our global supply base.\n\nEngaging suppliers in innovation: Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Supplier-Enabled Innovation Program allows us to generate innovative solutions through engagement with our supply base using an innovation technology platform. In 2022, Johnson & Johnson Procurement organization held its second annual Supplier-Enabled Innovation Awards event, recognizing the top innovations from these programs in 2021. Among the award winners were:\n\n- Manufacturing design improvement: Working with a supplier, J&J MedTech was able to improve the performance of Ethicon\u2019s flagship stapler by creating a new manufacturing process to deliver an enhanced design.\n- Enhancing precision marketing capabilities: Our OTC team in China worked with a supplier to generate unique data insights from consumer behavior data to help engage consumers and meet their needs more effectively.\n- Improving product sustainability: Johnson & Johnson Consumer Health in Brazil partnered with several suppliers to develop a sanitary napkin under our SEMPRE LIVRE brand that uses 50% less plastic and includes a pouch component that is made of 100% recyclable paper.\n\nPartnerships for Good: We executed three new Partnerships for Good in 2022, advancing our progress toward our Health for Humanity 2025 Goal to collaborate with suppliers to create 10 solutions that drive environmental, social and economic improvements, bringing our total to six Partnerships for Good to date. The three new initiatives in 2022 were:\n\n- Fair chance employment: This partnership with Kelly Services is designed to remove barriers to employment for contingent worker job candidates who may have been previously overlooked. In this program, Kelly Services works with Johnson & Johnson to evaluate existing policies on a job-category basis and to craft and introduce new policies that eliminate unnecessary barriers and develop new contingent assignment postings with more inclusive language.\n- Recyclable pumps: This partnership with supplier Aptar enabled Johnson & Johnson Consumer Health to launch a recyclable pump for our AVEENO brand in European markets with potential for expansion internationally. With more than 100 million pumps used annually by AVEENO, this innovation has the potential to prevent huge volumes of plastic from entering our waste streams.\n- Women\u2019s Empowerment Initiative: Working with supplier Sodexo, this partnership focuses on women\u2019s empowerment in EMEA and APAC, aiming to promote equal access for women to growth and opportunities in our workplaces. A program of initiatives, delivered jointly by Sodexo and Johnson & Johnson, includes mentoring, coaching, job-shadowing for women facing barriers to work, skilled volunteering opportunities and more.\n\nResponsible sourcing\n\nThroughout our business, we source commodities and raw materials, some of which require heightened procurement focus due to critical environmental or biodiversity concerns or elevated human rights risks in the supply chain. We work to understand the potential risks and impacts of our procurement activities in these areas and define appropriate standards and controls in responsible sourcing of commodities and raw materials of concern.\nSupplier Diversity\n\nOur Global Supplier Diversity & Inclusion program provides a platform for proactive outreach to diverse and small suppliers, collaboration with partners advancing supplier diversity and guidance to suppliers on how to engage with Johnson & Johnson. Now in the third decade of this program, we continue to realize the value that an inclusive supply base brings to our business, our people and our communities. We have expanded our global footprint driving social and economic impact in 20 markets, including the U.S.\n\nA key measure of our progress to advance supplier diversity is our Global Impact Spend, representing addressable spend with small and diverse suppliers globally and small businesses in the U.S. Global Impact Spend was also one of our Health for Humanity 2025 Goals and was exceeded in 2021. This Goal, while concluded, is confirmed as having been exceeded again in 2022.\n\nGlobal Impact Spend in 2022 by the Numbers\n\n- **$5.88 billion**\n  - Total Global Impact Spend, a 13% increase compared to 2021\n\n- **$2.927 million**\n  - with small businesses in the U.S.\n\n- **$537 million**\n  - with Tier 1 diverse suppliers in international markets\n\n- **$3.21 billion**\n  - in Tier 1 diverse spend\n  - **$650 million**\n  - in Tier 2 diverse spend\n\n- **$537 million**\n  - with Tier 1 diverse suppliers in international markets\n\n- **10% increase**\n  - in spend with U.S. Tier 1 Black- and Hispanic-owned businesses compared to 2021\n\n- **9% increase**\n  - in spend with U.S. Tier 1 women-owned businesses compared to 2021\n\nFor the 12th consecutive year, Johnson & Johnson maintained membership in the Billion Dollar Roundtable, a group of companies that advance best practices for supplier diversity and that spend at least $1 billion annually with diverse-owned suppliers.\n\nWe are really proud to partner with Johnson & Johnson, recognizing them in 2022 at the very highest platinum level in our annual Global Champions of Supplier Diversity and Inclusion awards. Johnson & Johnson are amongst the best of the best globally in regards of inclusive spend. Our partnership, now in its 11th year, continues to grow as we seek to jointly drive action to break down the barriers that prevent women business owners from accessing new market opportunities.\n\nElizabeth A. Vazquez\nCEO and Co-Founder, WEConnect International\n\nIn 2022, the Global Supplier Diversity & Inclusion team put additional focus on partnering with external advocacy partners to expand capability and capacity for diverse businesses. Following are a few highlights:\n\nBroadening diverse supplier capabilities to compete in a global market: Johnson & Johnson sponsored the National Minority Supplier Development Council\u2019s (NMSDC) Certificate of Excellence program, designed to broaden the capabilities of minority-owned businesses to compete in a global environment. During the nine-month program, launched in 2022, more than 80 select NMSDC-certified Women and Minority Business Enterprises benefited from coaching relationships with corporate leaders and mentors, as well as instructional seminars delivered by Rutgers Business School, subject matter experts from Johnson & Johnson and multiple industry partners.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s substantial support of diverse suppliers is an important indicator of their values. As a sponsor of a cohort of the NMSDC Center of Excellence Certificate Program, Johnson & Johnson is making a difference by investing in the growth of Minority Business Enterprises and Women Business Enterprises. That impacts communities and our economy. We are proud to partner with a company that has a long history of community engagement and corporate citizenship.\n\nJeffrey A. Robinson, Ph.D.\nAcademic Director, The Center for Entrepreneurship & Economic Development, Rutgers Business School\nExpanded mentoring in manufacturing and logistics: Johnson & Johnson also became a founding sponsor of the Diverse Manufacturing Supply Chain Alliance (DMSCA) Foundation. This sponsorship enabled the organization to expand its training to incorporate digitalization modules and assessments to build the capabilities of suppliers. We have been a corporate partner of DMSCA, a development program for diverse manufacturers and logistics suppliers, since 2009.\n\nBuilding capacity for women of color-owned businesses: Johnson & Johnson sponsored two cohorts totaling close to 50 women in the Women\u2019s Business Enterprise Council Metro NY and Greater DMV (District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia) Amplify program. Amplify is a program uniquely designed to engage and support women of color in maximizing opportunities to scale their businesses.\n\nSupporting the development of advocacy bodies around the world: We support the development of advocacy bodies who help us to discover and certify diverse suppliers; these are critical enablers to our program but also advance the adoption of supplier diversity and inclusion practices for other companies to drive even greater impact.\n\nDeveloping minority-owned supplier advocacy in Europe: Johnson & Johnson became a founding member of the European Supplier Diversity Project (ESDP), an initiative led by Minority Supplier Development UK to support ethnic minority and migrant-owned businesses. ESDP aims to enable these businesses to certify and access opportunities in corporate supply chains. The initiative was supported by research sponsored by Johnson & Johnson that documents why an increasingly diverse Europe needs equality in procurement for ethnic minority entrepreneurs, who frequently suffer discrimination on the basis of their race or ethnicity.\n\nIn 2022, we also sponsored the Buy Social Europe initiative to support our strategy to procure from Social Enterprises, as well as a new relationship with Out Britain to support our procurement from businesses owned by members of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nEngaging with customers and suppliers to extend end-to-end impact: We expanded our impact across our value chain through reporting and engagements with customers in the U.S. We introduced a customer engagement program in partnership with internal groups, connecting with more than 50 major customers across healthcare systems to share best practices and support their efforts to address social determinants of health. In addition, we grew our supplier Tier 2 spend reporting by 28% in 2022 through engagements with Johnson & Johnson prime suppliers.\n\nI entered this program hoping to build on the foundational understanding of running a business as a solopreneur, and I received so much more. I was able to expand my network and grow my business ... up 75% in revenue.\n\nBianca Ellis\nCEO, ProjACCT Workflow\n\n60 Legrain P. and Fitzgerald M., \u201cEQUIP Europe: Why an increasingly diverse Europe needs EQUality In Procurement for ethnic minority entrepreneurs,\u201d MSDUK, https://www.msduk.org.uk/static/EQUIP-Europe-Report.pdf, accessed February 2023.\nCorporate Governance\n\nOur Board of Directors oversees our Company in accordance with Our Credo values, enabling us to put the patients we serve first and create value for society while maintaining a thriving business.\n\nOur governance structure, policies and processes are designed to serve the needs of our business, our shareholders and other stakeholders and to promote a culture of accountability across the Enterprise. For details of our corporate governance principles and approach, our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework, governance structures, Board Charters, organizational documents and all SEC filings, please see our Position on Corporate Governance and the Corporate Governance section on Johnson & Johnson\u2019s website.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing execution of risk management duties and for assessing Johnson & Johnson\u2019s approach to risk management. The Board reviews and discusses strategic, operational, financial and reporting risks, as well as non-financial, or ESG, risks, including compliance, environmental, social (e.g., human capital management) and cybersecurity risks, leveraging the ERM Framework. For more information, see section: ESG Governance.\n\nChanges to our governance structure in 2022 included:\n\n\u2022 We announced the appointment of Joaquin Duato as the 10th Chairman of the Johnson & Johnson Board of Directors, in addition to his role as Chief Executive Officer, effective January 2023. We also announced that Alex Gorsky would be stepping down from his role as Executive Chairman.\n\n\u2022 During the annual review of how the Board evaluates and mitigates risk, we concluded that our Regulatory Compliance & Sustainability Committee was best positioned to oversee certain ESG matters alongside other complementary compliance matters. In turn, the Science & Technology Committee now oversees medical safety and devotes even greater attention to the Company\u2019s product pipeline and evaluation of innovative technologies. This restructuring helps ensure that our governance structure reflects the most important issues and opportunities facing Johnson & Johnson.\n\n\u2022 The collaboration between the Compensation & Benefits Committee and the Audit Committee of the Board was formalized to ensure that incentives and compensation are appropriately aligned with financial performance and Our Credo.\n\nFor more than 13 decades, Johnson & Johnson has shown that robust corporate practices, disciplined leadership and a values-driven culture is a winning mix, underpinning long-term value creation for our shareholders, patients, customers, partners and our employees around the world. As we move into the next era of our Company\u2019s history with the separation of our Consumer Health business, this reliable legacy of doing the right things in the right way positions us well to continue to deliver on Our Purpose of profoundly changing the future of health for humanity.\n\nLiz Forminard\nExecutive Vice President, General Counsel, Johnson & Johnson\nOur tax footprint evolves over time and reflects our healthcare activities and investments, including in research and development and manufacturing. What has not changed or wavered is our commitment to good corporate citizenship, which we demonstrate through sustainable values and behaviors relating to tax governance, compliance, planning, risk management, relationship with governmental authorities and transparency, which are more fully described in our Johnson & Johnson Tax Policy. This Tax Policy was updated in 2022 to provide greater transparency regarding our tax governance, compliance, tax planning and incentives.\n\nIn 2022, Johnson & Johnson contributed approximately $13.7 billion in taxes and fees to governments and economies around the world. This Total Tax Contribution is made up of two components: Total Taxes Borne by the Company and Total Taxes Collected. Taxes Borne are a direct cost to the Company, whereas Taxes Collected are collected from customers and employees on behalf of governments and ultimately remitted to them.\n\nOur intent is to provide a comprehensive view of total taxes paid around the world. Corporate Income Tax represents payments in all markets in which we operate and is the amount reported as Income Taxes Paid in the 2022 Annual Report. Other taxes shown aggregate the Company\u2019s data from 22 major markets that represent the vast majority of our revenues. We aspire to include all markets in future years.

These collections were in the form of payroll and social insurance taxes from approximately 153,700 employees across the world, sales and use taxes and value-added taxes. These taxes are collected on behalf of governments from employees, customers and other business partners. Taxes Collected are an important part of the measure of the contribution made by Johnson & Johnson through job creation and business activities in the many countries in which we operate.\n\n**Total Taxes Borne:** In 2022, Johnson & Johnson bore $7.7 billion in taxes around the world. The taxes include corporate income taxes, the Company\u2019s share of payroll and social insurance taxes and the Company\u2019s share of sales and other taxes. Sales taxes include sales, use and non-recoverable value-added tax. Other taxes are primarily comprised of customs and other duties such as local taxes and special fees related to the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n---\n\n61 The tax information contained in this section is intended to provide the reader with an overview of all taxes contributed by Johnson & Johnson, and not just income taxes. It should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s tax information filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including in the most recently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. This tax information is supplemental to, and not a substitute for, the information reported in the Company\u2019s SEC filings.\nEthics & Compliance\n\nThe values that guide our decision-making are spelled out in Our Credo, which guides us to act ethically and within the laws that govern our businesses everywhere and at all times. Supported by comprehensive policies, procedures and training programs, everyone at Johnson & Johnson knows the value of doing the right thing.\n\nWe embed Our Credo values throughout our Company to ensure all employees and contingent workers know their responsibilities to act in accordance with applicable laws, regulations and industry codes, as well as the Company\u2019s internal standards and expectations for ethical and compliant conduct. We use our biennial Our Credo Survey to assess how our values come to life across the Enterprise, which is supplemented in alternate years by the Our Voice Survey, which monitors employee sentiment related to many topics, including ethical business conduct.\n\nBuilding on Our Credo values, Our Code of Business Conduct (CBC) and Health Care Compliance (HCC) policies list comprehensive ethical standards for decisions and actions in every market where we operate. Mandatory CBC training is conducted every two years, and HCC training is conducted each year. All new employees are assigned and required to complete CBC, HCC and other relevant required training.\n\nAspects of ethics and compliance we advanced in 2022 included:\n\n- Updating our compliance framework: We revised our HCC Framework to provide updated practical guidance on compliance with HCC guidelines based on the \u201cTen Hallmarks of an Effective Compliance Program\u201d of the U.S. Department of Justice and to highlight specific focus on the role of our business leaders in setting a strong message at the top and continuing to drive a culture of accountability throughout our organization.\n\n- Annual compliance training: Our Enterprise HCC Annual Training encompasses the foundations of compliance using role-based topics and scenarios to drive training effectiveness. We design our training with the objective of ensuring learning is achieved, incorporating interactive challenges and a final assessment. We evaluate learning transfer using our proprietary methodology, and in 2022, our evaluation showed that learning transfer proved to be statistically reliable for a third year in a row. This indicates that critical thinking was required to answer the Enterprise HCC Annual Training assessment questions correctly and that passing the assessment was not simply the result of guesswork.\n\n- Reinforcing our culture of accountability: Throughout 2022, our communication and training efforts focused on strengthening the culture of accountability with several initiatives, including communications from leadership; ethical leadership workshops using situational cases; and training to assist in preventing, detecting and correcting non-compliant behavior, as well as the Compliance Week 2022 Initiative containing interactive games, contests, and appealing communication materials to support culture-building initiatives under the tagline \u201cPeople Follow People.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, the Johnson & Johnson Enterprise HCC Annual Training Measuring Effectiveness methodology was awarded the prestigious Brandon Hall Gold Award for \u201cBest Advance in Compliance Training,\u201d along with a Silver Award for \u201cBest Advance in Learning Measurement.\u201d\n\n| Compliance-Related Investigations and Responsible Marketing Indicators | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Number of compliance-related allegations investigated | 749 | 661 | 559 |\n| Percentage of compliance-related allegations investigated by category | | | |\n| Healthcare compliance | 55% | 48% | 41% |\n| Financial | 36% | 43% | 51% |\n| Other | 9% | 9% | 8% |\n| Number of warning letters or untitled letters issued by OPDP or APLB in the U.S. | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n\n\u2021 See PwC\u2019s Report of Independent Accountants and Management\u2019s Assertion and PwC\u2019s Report of Independent Accountants in previous Health for Humanity Reports.\n\n* OPDP: Office of Prescription Drug Promotion; APLB: Advertising and Promotional Labeling Branch of the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.\n\n1 See PwC\u2019s Report of Independent Accountants and Management\u2019s Assertion and PwC\u2019s Report of Independent Accountants in previous Health for Humanity Reports.\n\nGRI 2-27, 205-2, 206-1, 417-1, 417-2, 417-3, J&J22-3, J&J22-4\nIndependent assessment of external research proposals:\nSince 2014, we have been working with the Yale University Open Data Access (YODA) Project to enable a consistent approach for the independent assessment of external research proposals requesting the use of clinical trial data generated by Johnson & Johnson companies. As of 2022, 301 research proposals have been reviewed and 85 articles published using data shared through the YODA Project, enabling researchers to create new insights that advance science and medicine and lead to improvements in public health. Johnson & Johnson continues to demonstrate its support of expanding the reach of clinical trial data and, in 2022, joined the Vivli Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Data Register (see section: Antimicrobial Resistance).\n\nWe collaborate with NYU School of Medicine to support Janssen decision making for investigational medicine requests, also known as \u201ccompassionate use\u201d or \u201cpre-approval access.\u201d The Compassionate Use Advisory Committee (CompAC) comprising ethicists, physicians and patient representatives independently selected by NYU, provides recommendations to Janssen on pre-approval access plans and individual requests received at Janssen. CompAC affirms Johnson & Johnson\u2019s commitment to ensuring a transparent, ethical and objective approach to reviewing compassionate use requests. Since 2015, Janssen has provided access to almost 8,000 patients globally through its Pre-Approval Access (PAA) Program. In 2022, we further advanced transparency by providing, for the first time, a list of potential treatment options available per country or territory on Janssen.com.\n\nKeeping bioethics on the agenda: Our Office of the Chief Medical Officer (OCMO) sponsors the Johnson & Johnson Bioethics Committee (JJBC), which advises our global teams on ethical issues, in alignment with our Ethical Code of Conduct for R&D. In 2022, the JJBC continued to advise many Johnson & Johnson teams on ethical questions related to research, access to investigational medicines and data transparency; conducted workshops on bioethics principles; and launched a bioethics-related mentoring program for employees. JBC members undertook professional ethics training with Fellowships at Auschwitz for the Study of Professional Ethics (FASPE). In addition, OCMO sponsored the Harvard Multi-Regional Clinical Trials Bioethics Collaborative; a bioethics colloquium convened by NYU and the New York Academy of Sciences; and co-founded and co-chairs the Bioethics Community within DIA, a global organization advancing life sciences networks.\n\nPromoting animal welfare: Research involving animals has led to major medical advances and will continue to be an important part of further discoveries until viable non-animal alternatives are developed and accepted. Year after year, we utilize non-animal alternatives whenever possible and work with regulatory bodies to gain acceptance of appropriate non-animal alternatives. Johnson & Johnson is committed to the 3Rs principles for the ethical treatment of animals involved in biomedical research\u2014replacing, reducing and refining their use whenever possible. Our Global Animal Welfare Officer is responsible for ensuring adherence to and monitoring our animal welfare standards, supported by many R&D professionals who are certified in different aspects of veterinary medicine and animal welfare. Learn more \u2192\n\nAs part of our commitment to the ethical and humane treatment of laboratory animals under our care, we hold an annual 3Rs awards program to recognize our teams\u2019 outstanding achievements in replacing, reducing and refining the use of animals in the fields of biomedical research, education or training. In 2022, the winning innovation advanced the use of donated human cadavers to avoid animal use in HCD training on medical devices. We are transparent about our animal welfare practice and engage widely to inform, share and work toward improving public policy on animal testing. For example, in 2022, Janssen\u2019s Beere site in Belgium welcomed the Animal Welfare Committee from the Flemish Parliament and a number of other stakeholders from the life sciences ecosystem. Visitors toured the animal facilities and engaged in discussions around Janssen\u2019s animal welfare policy and alternatives that could reduce animal testing.\n\n100% of facilities with animals have veterinary oversight. 100% of sites with animals are accredited by AALAC International.\nHuman Rights\n\nGuided by Our Credo values, we respect and promote human rights across our operations, through our business relationships and in the communities in which we operate.\n\nFocus Areas: In line with the UNGPs, we focus our efforts in areas where the potential and actual risk of adverse human rights impacts linked to our business is most significant. In 2022, we established a four-pillar framework to guide our human rights priority focus areas and related action plans.\n\nFair Working Conditions\nEnsuring fair working conditions for Johnson & Johnson employees and engaging our suppliers to do the same across our supply base\n\nAccess to Healthcare\nAdvancing sustainable and equitable access to medicines and medical solutions that save and improve lives, cure patients and prevent disease for those in need\n\nSafe, Effective Products\nProviding patients, consumers and healthcare providers with products that are as effective and safe as possible at every stage of product development, manufacturing, supply chain and commercialization\n\nSustainable Environment\nImproving the environmental footprint of our operations, our products and value chain, while also integrating human rights considerations into our environmental policies and programs\n\nLearn more \u2192\n\nThe Regulatory Compliance & Sustainability Committee (RCSC) of the Board of Directors provides oversight of management\u2019s approach to respecting human rights. In 2022, the RCSC received an update outlining the continued evolution of the Company\u2019s approach to human rights and external regulatory and stakeholder developments.\n\nImproving human rights due diligence: We continually evolve and strengthen our broad-based human rights due diligence process. In 2022, we worked with ERM, an independent sustainability consultancy, to develop a risk identification tool to better identify geographic sites and at a potentially higher risk of adverse human rights impacts within Johnson & Johnson\u2019s own operations and facilities. The tool will be deployed in 2023 to prioritize targeted due diligence reviews. In our supply base, we continued to assess human rights risks in our supply chain through the use of tools such as EcoVadis self-assessments from suppliers in our SSP and supplier audits. We also updated our Responsibility Standards for Suppliers (RSS), which strengthened guidance on how suppliers should establish policies and management systems to identify and address human rights impacts, and we provided training for suppliers on the RSS updates (see section: Supplier Engagement).\n\nWe prohibit the use of any forced or bonded labor in the manufacture of any product, or any component of a product, as outlined in our Anti-Human Trafficking Policy and Employment of Young Persons Policy. In 2022, we established an Anti-Modern Slavery work stream to advance our due diligence efforts in this area. We worked with Impact\u2014a consulting firm specializing in ethical trade and human rights\u2014to support us in developing a suite of modern slavery due diligence materials such as training materials, a supplier assessment questionnaire and investigation guidelines. We also integrated Verisk Maplecroft risk indicators on Modern Slavery into our Supplier Risk Management system to identify potentially higher-risk suppliers. This work will inform further due diligence in 2023.\n\nMaintaining a living wage: In line with our commitment to fair working conditions, we continued in 2022 to implement an annual living wage assessment in collaboration with Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) to ensure employees in all the countries in which we operate receive pay that is both market competitive and sufficient to attain a sustainable standard of living. As in previous years, we made a small number of wage adjustments in countries to ensure our living wage standards were met.\n\nCapability building: All Johnson & Johnson employees and certain categories of contingent workers are assigned and required to complete the Code of Business Conduct training, available in 27 languages, every two years. This training includes guidance related to human rights. Furthermore, our Foundational Human Rights Learning and Education course is available to all employees globally. At the end of 2022, more than 3,400 employees and contingent workers key to our human rights program had completed the module.\n\nIn 2022, 99% of Johnson & Johnson Procurement employees completed mandatory human rights training.\n\nCollaborating to advance human rights: We continue to participate in various external platforms to share insights and good practices across industry, including Shift\u2019s Business Learning Program, BSR\u2019s Human Rights Working Group and the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative Human Rights and Labor Working Group.\n\nLearn more about our approach and frameworks to respecting human rights in our Position on Human Rights, our Responsibility Standards for Suppliers and related ESG Policies & Positions. For our grievance mechanism, see section Ethics & Compliance.\nQuality management\n\nOur commitment to quality, safety and reliability is the basis for everything we do. Our Quality Policies and Quality Standards cover the lifecycle of our products from R&D to the patient and consumer experience. They provide a framework and common foundation of quality expectations and help ensure a reliable supply of high-quality products across all our business segments in the markets we serve.\n\nIn 2022, our Quality & Compliance organization led several improvements in our quality and compliance practices, including:\n\nTransforming quality processes with digital solutions: Many tasks in Quality & Compliance are transactional, and to date, much employee time has been spent on manual processes. Automating manual tasks by applying intelligent analytical tools allows employees to tackle higher-value tasks such as data-driven proactive decision making and assessing larger data sets to further advance preventive quality management and create valuable product and patient insights.\n\nWe continued to progress the digital transformation of our quality process and management systems in several ways, including:\n\n\u2022 Installed a new data portal to increase access to Quality & Compliance data sources and improve agility through quality insights, analytical data tools and dashboards across all business segments.\n\u2022 Achieved considerable efficiencies through the automation of manual processes, enabled by IA applications, in combination with data insights and natural language processing solutions.\n\u2022 Developed new digital tools to assist in simplifying and improving the quality of literature, document and report reviews; capturing product insights from complaints; improving product release cycle time through transparency planning and managing sample and process flows.\n\nReinforcing our commitment to quality, all employees are required to take our interactive e-Learning Quality Management Framework course. The course informs employees about our quality management systems and provides examples of roles and responsibilities that help maintain quality across Johnson & Johnson and how everyone, in every role, should play a part.\n\nCarol Montandon\nGlobal Vice President, Chief Quality Officer, Johnson & Johnson\n\nProduct Quality\n\nJohnson & Johnson reaches patients and consumers across the world with our medicines, medical technologies and consumer health products. Their safety when using our products is a critical priority for Johnson & Johnson: We insist on quality and safety at every stage of product development, manufacturing, supply chain and commercialization.\n\nWe have a bold ambition to be at the leading edge in our industry with a quality and compliance organization enabled by a fully connected digital ecosystem and highly competent people who are skilled in managing and addressing all aspects of the quality spectrum. The future of healthcare will increasingly rely upon digital solutions, and we have been continually evolving our systems and our teams to embrace digital technology that support consistent quality, compliance and positive experiences with our products for patients, consumers and customers.\n\nProduct Quality Indicators\n\n| Indicator | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|-----------|------|------|------|\n| Number of FDA warning letters issued | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Product recall rate* by business segment | | | |\n| Pharmaceutical | 0.003%\u2021 | 0% | 0% |\n| MedTech | 0.006%\u2021 | 0.059% | 0.034% |\n| Consumer Health Self-Care OTC** | 0%\u2021 | 0% | 0% |\n\n\u2021 See PwC\u2019s Report of Independent Accountants and Management\u2019s Assertion and PwC\u2019s Report of Independent Accountants in previous Health for Humanity Reports.\n\n* Product recall rate is defined as the number of lots removed from market per total globally manufactured, based on field action removals where it has been determined internally by a Quality Review Board, and aligned by Johnson & Johnson Enterprise Compliance, that there is a reasonable probability that the product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences and, in certain cases, will cause serious adverse health consequences. ** The Pharmaceutical and MedTech recall rates consider all products in each business segment. The Consumer Health product quality recall rate is inclusive of Consumer Health products from the Self-Care over-the-counter (OTC) business segment.\nIntroducing a new quality model for better customer experience: Customer Experience Engineering (CxE) is a new proactive quality model and capability that supports the involvement of our Quality & Compliance organization in technical improvements for products and services. CxE focuses entirely on the experiences of our customers and is led by internal Quality experts who can make a practical contribution to solving product challenges. With several projects in the pipeline, CxE promises to help transform the experience of patients, physicians and surgeons by enhancing our product and delivery quality with tangible customer outcomes. For example, in 2022, the Quality & Compliance CxE team engaged with the J&J MedTech DePuy Synthes team to solve a challenge relating to its PUREVUE Visualization System, which is used for arthroscopic procedures. When the system\u2019s camera lens began to fog up during procedures, temporarily clouding the visualization of the operating area, the CxE team visited surgeons to witness the issue in real time in operating rooms and contributed to a new design solution that significantly improved the temporary visualization issue.\n\nReimagining Quality Month: Our theme for 2022 Quality Month was \u201cDigitally Enabled End-to-End Quality,\u201d which was supported by weekly topics that encouraged our global sites to focus on critical Quality & Compliance initiatives:\n\n- **Digital transformation:** Using digital to enable our employees, customers and patients.\n- **Strategy:** Leading the way in end-to-end patient, consumer and customer experiences enabled by a fully integrated digital ecosystem.\n- **Innovation:** Innovating through the use of digital tools to enhance customer success.\n- **Learning:** Driving learning and engagement beyond Quality Month to build a digitally enabled workforce for the future.\n\nRefreshing our Quality & Compliance Competency Model: This model prioritizes upskilling our people to prepare them for proactive and capable quality management in a digitally enabled future. It encourages employees to actively participate in their individual career journey and promotes a culture of continuous and innovative learning.\n\nThe Quality & Compliance Capability Framework, including the Competency Model, developed with wide collaboration across Johnson & Johnson, is aligned with our Enterprise approach to learning and development and provides an advanced platform to ensure our employees are developing within the critical capabilities needed most to deliver on our Quality & Compliance strategic goals, including strengthening the Quality & Compliance talent pipeline.\nMedical Safety\n\nAt Johnson & Johnson, we recognize our fundamental responsibility is to provide patients, consumers and healthcare providers with products that are as effective and safe as possible. We take an evidence- and science-based, ethics- and values-driven approach to medical safety, putting patient and consumer well-being first and foremost in our decision making and actions.\n\nThe Office of the Chief Medical Officer (OCMO) is a global, functionally independent group of medical and scientific professionals working across Johnson & Johnson to guide excellence in product safety and development across our three business segments. We apply our expertise in safety science, epidemiology and bioethics to inform evidence- and science-based product decisions that put people first. OCMO also chairs the Pharmaceutical Development Committee, which reviews product development plans to ensure that our products address unmet needs and benefit the people who will ultimately use them.\n\nOur Healthcare for Women 2025 Goal reflects the growing importance of RWD in improving health outcomes.\n\nOCMO, in collaboration with many internal and external groups, advanced multiple initiatives to improve medical safety, including innovative RWD methods to generate reliable real-world evidence about patient health outcomes across numerous initiatives spanning pharmaceutical products, vaccines, medical devices and Consumer Health products. Highlights of this work in 2022 include:\n\n- Improving access to critical medical devices using RWD: We conducted RWD studies to inform clinical and regulatory safety decision making in two key areas: evaluating the safety of our TFN-ADVANCED Proximal Femoral Nailing System compared to other nail implants to treat hip fractures and evaluating the potential risk of cancer and reproductive issues associated with cobalt-containing devices. Our work in both areas generated extensive evidence of comparative safety of both TFN-ADVANCED and cobalt-containing products being confirmed as safe to use in patients, which we supported with the publication of six papers in peer-reviewed journals to drive transparency among patients, surgeons and regulators. These studies are important to provide information on the safety and effectiveness of these devices, which provide life-changing healthcare for thousands of patients in different parts of the world.\n\n- Treatment for children suffering from active psoriatic arthritis (PsA): OCMO\u2019s Child Health Innovation Leadership Department (CHILD) supported Janssen\u2019s clinical development team in the design and execution of a pediatric safety study to evaluate the safety of a new treatment option for pediatric patients with active PsA. The generated data, now in our label, supported a much-needed treatment option to enable children suffering from PsA to live a fuller life.\n\n- Spearheading medication safety and education: Health education programs can help families protect small children from accidental unsupervised ingestion of medicines, a frequent occurrence that often requires emergency treatment. In 2022, OCMO collaborated with Young Minds Inspired to develop educational resources to teach youth about OTC medicine safety, and continued to advance safe pill storage innovation in collaboration with the CDC PROTECT Initiative and QuickFire Challenge Awardee Gatekeeper Innovation Inc. The winning QuickFire Challenge concept, which reinvented the traditional pill minder for improved safety, functionality and patient adherence, is anticipated for commercialization in 2023.\n\nJanssen participated, along with industry experts and regulators, in the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Expert Working Group on development of the ICH E19 Guideline that aims to support large-scale efficacy and safety clinical trials.\n\nAdvancing the safety of children: The safety of children has always been a priority for Johnson & Johnson in R&D and across our OTC medicines. Achievements in 2022 include:\n\n- Treatment for children suffering from active psoriatic arthritis (PsA): OCMO\u2019s Child Health Innovation Leadership Department (CHILD) supported Janssen\u2019s clinical development team in the design and execution of a pediatric safety study to evaluate the safety of a new treatment option for pediatric patients with active PsA. The generated data, now in our label, supported a much-needed treatment option to enable children suffering from PsA to live a fuller life.\n\n- Spearheading medication safety and education: Health education programs can help families protect small children from accidental unsupervised ingestion of medicines, a frequent occurrence that often requires emergency treatment. In 2022, OCMO collaborated with Young Minds Inspired to develop educational resources to teach youth about OTC medicine safety, and continued to advance safe pill storage innovation in collaboration with the CDC PROTECT Initiative and QuickFire Challenge Awardee Gatekeeper Innovation Inc. The winning QuickFire Challenge concept, which reinvented the traditional pill minder for improved safety, functionality and patient adherence, is anticipated for commercialization in 2023.\n\nAt Johnson & Johnson, leading OCMO provides me and our entire team with the opportunity to make a far-reaching and lasting contribution to improving patients\u2019 lives by delivering the most advanced methods to assure product safety in our Company and across our industry.\n\nWilliam N. Hait, M.D., Ph.D.\nExecutive Vice President, Chief External Innovation and Medical Officer, Johnson & Johnson\nPromoting maternal health: OCMO supported the advancement of maternal health and maternal health equity in the U.S. through continued guidance to clinical teams in conducting evidence-generation activities that include women, as well as pregnant and lactating women, and collective action to close the Black maternal health equity gap. Through this work, we are accelerating sex-disaggregated data, uncovering insights that can improve care and outcomes for women and offering evidence so that pregnant people and their providers can make informed decisions about the safe use of Johnson & Johnson products. Recent examples include:\n\n- Accelerating women-centric science by further shifting from sex-biased to more sex-inclusive science and data to provide treatment and innovation that is specifically tailored for women. OCMO collaborated with different groups within Johnson & Johnson to provide sex-differentiated analyses on immunologic, neurologic and other conditions to understand the experiences that men and women have and how altering the approach to treatment might enhance the health of both sexes. Through our Healthcare for Women Health for Humanity 2025 Goal, we delivered nine publications that provide sex-differentiated analyses for long COVID, psoriasis and other conditions.\n\n- Advancing pregnancy and lactation science through the Johnson & Johnson Pregnancy and Lactation Advisory Group (JJ-PAL), composed of experts across 14 functions to support the planning of evidence-generation activities in pregnant and lactating people. JJ-PAL progressed in several areas in 2022, including nine internal consultations to product teams to help improve designing and interpreting evidence related to safe use of medication during pregnancy or lactation; delivering a searchable inventory of global RWD sources for studying medication use during pregnancy and lactation; co-chairing a National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine Workshop to facilitate inclusion of pregnant and lactating people in clinical research; and initiating a survey of pregnant, postpartum and lactating persons in the U.S. to better understand opportunities for increased inclusion of pregnant and lactating people in clinical trials.\n\n- Improving maternal health outcomes for Black women through several activities that included initiating an effort to design a care model that reimagines the role of the front office staff as patient connectors, advocates and critical members of the care team; initiating an effort to elevate representation of Black people in medical illustrations; and continuing to advance multiple pilot projects to investigate the creation of digital tools to help advance maternal healthcare services for Black women and birthing people.\n\nEnhancing the patient voice in clinical studies: We are co-leading the Innovative Medicines Initiative PREFER project, a five-year project to establish recommendations for industry regulatory authorities and Health Technology Assessment bodies on how and when to use patient preferences on benefits and risks of medicinal products in decision making. Johnson & Johnson serves on the PREFER steering committee, and in 2022, we closely supported two achievements:\n\n- PREFER released a detailed framework and recommendations for industry, regulators and health technology assessment bodies on the assessment and use of patient preferences in medical product decision making.\n\n- The PREFER framework received formal qualification from the EMA and the European Network for Health Technology Assessment (EUnetHTA).\n\nThe EMA qualification of the PREFER framework is significant because it will enable a more explicit pathway for stakeholders to engage with the EMA on conducting patient-focused, structured benefit-risk assessments. It will also help to grow the acceptability of such studies as part of clinical and regulatory decisions around the world.\n\nIn 2022, we co-authored a new report from the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) with recommendations to involve patients throughout the lifecycle of medicines.\n\nTalc safety: We continue to address allegations that JOHNSON\u2019S Baby Powder can cause adverse health effects. We sympathize deeply with patients and their families and appreciate that they are seeking answers. However, the science and the facts show that their illnesses were not caused by their use of our talcum-based products. For more information, please see factsabouttalc.com.\n\nTalc transition: In 2022, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Health made the commercial decision to transition to an all cornstarch-based baby powder portfolio as part of a larger portfolio assessment. As a result of this transition, talc-based JOHNSON\u2019S Baby Powder will be discontinued globally in 2023.\nCounterfeiting & Illicit Trade\n\nFor Johnson & Johnson, trade in counterfeit products is enormously concerning. Counterfeit healthcare products place people\u2014the very people we aim to help\u2014at risk of adverse events, serious health problems and potentially death. Fake medical products undermine confidence in product quality, safety and reliability, which, at Johnson & Johnson, are at the center of everything we do.\n\nWe constantly strive to adopt new ways of monitoring and detecting illicit trade through enhanced product security and analytics. Advanced technologies are critical in addressing the growing sophistication of illicit trade, especially in online marketplaces. Our 24/7 online monitoring includes more than 780 global marketplaces, 108 dark web locations, 24 social media sites and more than 294,000 unique domains. We investigate bad actors and seek to stop the flow of illicit trade by sharing relevant information with law enforcement to assist in tracking down and prosecuting those who are endangering patients through illicit trading activities.\n\nFake medicines kill almost 500,000 sub-Saharan Africans a year.62\n\nIn 2022, we conducted 104 training sessions that led to 24 related seizures of illicit trade shipments in various regions.\n\nDuring 2022, we continued to reinforce our programs and engage widely across our markets, including with regulatory bodies, to protect our patients by combating fake products and illicit trade. For example, throughout the first half of 2022, Johnson & Johnson was actively involved in an investigation into a counterfeit HIV medication ring and filed suit against a number of distributors and pharmacies who were involved with this scheme. On June 17, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) announced the arrest and indictments of two individuals for allegedly distributing more than $230 million in adulterated HIV drugs to unsuspecting patients across the U.S. We continue to engage with the DoJ and law enforcement in ongoing investigations.\n\nJ&J MedTech\u2019s Ethicon created a compelling educational campaign targeting healthcare facilities to raise awareness about risks of counterfeit medical devices to patients and how to prevent their introduction into the supply chain. Informational materials were distributed and promoted by Ethicon\u2019s sales force using various channels; for example, Ethicon presented information about how the illegal gray market is a conduit to counterfeit products to 1,300 attendees at the American Society for Healthcare Risk Management (ASHRM) 2022 Annual Conference. This was the first time this topic had ever been presented at ASHRM to an influential audience of healthcare risk professionals, and we hope this will lead to further engagement and collaboration to combat illicit trade.\n\nGuided by Our Credo, we aim to safeguard patients and our brand reputation against the risks posed by illicit trade, which includes product counterfeiting, tampering and illegal diversion. Protecting patients and consumers against counterfeit versions of our products is essential in promoting worldwide access to beneficial healthcare and our genuine Johnson & Johnson products.\n\nWe continue to record our trademarks with customs and border protection agencies to help eliminate illicit versions of our products from crossing borders around the world. We conduct specialized training for various national and international law enforcement agencies across the globe.\n\n62 United Nations News, \u201cFake medicines kill almost 500,000 sub-Saharan Africans a year: UNODC report,\u201d https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/02/1133062, accessed February 2023.\nInformation Security & Data Privacy\n\nWe believe in maintaining a proactive information security strategy to protect information assets against deliberate or inadvertent threats to safeguard our business.\n\nWe improved the robustness of our information security and privacy programs in 2022 in the following ways:\n\nEnhancing protection against cyber risk in critical pharmaceutical research: We improved the cyber posture of multiple Pharmaceutical R&D sites, deploying additional cyber capabilities to protect both systems and data. These actions improved the protection of Company IP and the resilience of our R&D environments in meeting the needs of our healthcare partners and patients, reduced the potential for R&D to be negatively affected by a cyber event and increased the protection of Company IP. New capabilities included technology implementations in research and laboratory environments to provide increased visibility to the security posture of R&D systems and detection of potential cyber threats.\n\nExpanding cyber capabilities: Through both investments in new capabilities and strategic partnerships, we improved the security of company products, data and systems. Our initiatives included a strategic investment in technology from an industry-leading security provider to enhance the security of our medical device product suite, the deployment of new capabilities supporting continued adoption of zero trust principles for increased cyber protection of both the Company and our customers and deployment of advanced AI-supported tools to better detect and block security threats.\n\nProtecting personal information: We continued our commitment to protecting personal information of our consumers, clinical research participants and employees, expanding our efforts to ensure compliance with growing legal and regulatory data protection requirements that broaden the protection of individual data subject rights. At the same time, we continued to participate in industry associations and external forums to help shape new regulations under review on cross-border data flows, data localization and other healthcare initiatives in the privacy and cybersecurity space. Focus areas in 2022 included establishing compliance programs for new and expanded U.S. state privacy laws and multiple privacy and data security legal regulations in China. We also supported data science and digital initiatives, including defining standards for anonymization, pseudonymization and de-identification, to increase our ability to compliantly leverage data insights and promote digital health solutions in our sectors. We made progress on various key privacy processes designed to consistently support the rights of consumers and patients for the management of their personal data and delivered privacy support to ensure successful completion of major deals.\n\nReinforcing our cybersecurity and privacy frameworks: To ensure continuous evaluation and enhancement of the Johnson & Johnson cybersecurity program, we periodically undertake program maturity assessments and pursue security certifications. By way of example, in 2022, we engaged an independent third party to conduct a maturity assessment against the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, providing a current view of program maturity and areas for continued improvement. We also obtained ISO 27001 certification for the environment supporting the Johnson & Johnson CAR-T immunotherapy offering in EMEA, extending the number of certifications we hold for a range of Company products. In parallel, we monitor the introduction of new standards such as ISO 31700 covering Privacy by Design, which was released in early 2023, to evaluate the requirements and technical controls needed for the certification process.\n\nEnhancing cyber awareness: Through 2022, we offered our employees around the globe various opportunities to improve their cyber awareness and learn more about smart cyber practices in innovative ways. One example is our CyberEscape online escape rooms, which attracted hundreds of employees who worked in teams to solve a series of basic cyber challenges and puzzles in different escape room scenarios, raising their cybersecurity knowledge. Additionally, alongside our ongoing information security and privacy training for all employees, in 2022, we expanded our Johnson & Johnson PhishSmarts phishing simulation program. This program provides quarterly simulated phishing emails and follow-up to help employees better detect real phishing attempts and defend against phishing email threats, which pose a potential risk to our organization.\n\nSimilarly, Johnson & Johnson is committed to data privacy and ensuring that protecting personal information is integral to our core way of operating. In addition to our Code of Business Conduct and compliance with the laws that apply to our operating companies\u2019 handling of personal information, we maintain robust data privacy controls to protect the personal information of our employees, customers, partners and all those who entrust their information to us.\n\nThe complex patchwork of compliance obligations and active regulatory enforcement in many international markets imposes greater demands on data protection and cyber professionals to design the right type of governance models and solutions to ensure that Johnson & Johnson can compliantly pursue its data-related initiatives across the globe.\n\nEnsuring availability of critical systems and preventing unintended or unauthorized access to business and personal information is foundational to our business continuity and the people who rely on Johnson & Johnson each day.\n\nGary Harbison\nChief Information Security Officer (CISO), Johnson & Johnson\n\nWinston Khoo\nChief Privacy Officer, Johnson & Johnson\nThe Reporting Hub contains the following information:\n\nESG Performance Data \u2192\nIndependent Assurance Statements \u2192\nGlossary \u2192\n\nThe following downloads supplement the 2022 Health for Humanity Report:\n\n- 2022 ESG Summary\n- 2022 ESG Disclosure Index detailing our performance against the following ESG standards and frameworks:\n  - Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)\n  - Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)\n  - Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n  - Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM)\n  - UN Global Compact (UNGC);

Employee data may not include full population from more recently acquired companies, and individuals on long-term disability are excluded. Contingent workers, contractors and subcontractors are also excluded. Allocated headcount is excluded from Global Employee data, as well as other employee and DEI-related disclosures.\n3. Fixed-term employees (employee with a contract for a limited period that ends when the specific time period expires, or when the specific task or event that has an attached time estimate is completed) are excluded from other employee and DEI-related disclosures. Fixed-term contracts make up less than 5% of total employees plus individuals on fixed-term contracts.\n4. Values have been rounded to the nearest tenth. Due to rounding, the numbers presented do not add up precisely to the totals provided, and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.\n5. Professional positions are defined as pay grades 20\u201326; management positions are defined as pay grades 30 and above; executives are defined as employees reporting directly to the CEO.\n6. 2022 figures are as of April 2023. 2021 figures are as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 figures are as of December 31, 2020.\n7. As of October 2020, new categories were added to allow employees to actively decline self-identification or remain unidentified. Where the value for \u201cDeclined to answer\u201d rounded to zero, we excluded from the reported table.\n8. Gender and ethnic/racial diversity are reported in accordance with the gender, ethnicity, and race as self-reported by the employee and recorded in the Human Resources Information System (HRIS) as of December 31, 2022. \u201cOther\u201d is defined as employees who self-reported as American Indian or Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, or two or more races.\n9. Career progression movement includes upward promotion and lateral transfer, and excludes employees in the R&D organizations.\n10. Category includes employees who don\u2019t have a merit plan as part of their compensation package.\n11. 2021 numbers were restated.\n12. In 2022, Johnson & Johnson invested significantly in our internal J&J Learn platform, and identified areas of efficiency with our Learning and Development vendors, resulting in a decrease in our external spend. Due to overlapping spend between categories, Johnson & Johnson returned to a consolidated reporting approach for learning and development.\n13. Reported Injury/Illness Rates are excluding COVID cases.\n14. Average hours of enterprise-wide training data represents available data from three of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s primary learning management systems. We are working to include training data from additional sources available in future. Where training durations were not included, we applied estimates based on training type.\n15. Lost days are calendar days counted beginning the day after an incident has taken place.\n16. CPMM and IPMM rates are based on Safe Fleet data. Rate calculation methodology uses both actual and estimated data on miles driven. We collect Safe Fleet data on employees who drive Company-owned or -leased and personally owned vehicles for Company business. Employees in the latter category are those who: 1) drive for Company business as a \u201cregular part\u201d of their job duties, and 2) receive a car allowance to purchase their own vehicle and/or are reimbursed for vehicle expenses such as fuel, maintenance, insurance and other miscellaneous charges associated with vehicle upkeep.\n17.

paired with appropriate economic input/output (IO) emission factors from the Carnegie Mellon 2002 data set. Where more specific primary data were able to be obtained, they were used in place of the IO calculation methodology.\n\n7 Business travel emissions from personal vehicle travel reflect CO\u2082 only.\n\n8 Data from a 2022 survey of a sample of employees in all regions, extrapolated for all employees globally, were used to estimate average employee commuting and remote working emissions intensity per employee. This value was used to calculate 2022 emissions from Employee Commuting. Year over year trend may be due to methodology adjustments.\n\n9 Emissions from fuel- and energy-related activities were calculated for emissions from transmission and distribution (T&D) losses from purchased electricity, well-to-tank (WTT) emissions from purchased electricity, WTT emissions from T&D losses, and WTT emissions from purchased fuels. Emissions were calculated using International Energy Agency (IEA) loss factors for electricity and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) WTT emission factors for fuels and electricity.\n\n10 Emissions from Upstream Leased Assets were calculated by applying the energy intensity from office locations in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 footprint to the building area of leased assets less than 50,000 square feet, or those greater than 50,000 square feet outside of our operational control which are excluded from Scope 1 and Scope 2 reporting.\n\n11 Emissions from Waste Generated in Operations were calculated for both non-hazardous and hazardous waste from manufacturing and R&D operations using Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs\u2019 emissions factors for waste.\n\n12 Emissions from Downstream Transportation and Distribution were calculated using the U.S. EPA\u2019s SmartWay Program and are provided for U.S. shippers only. GHG covered in these calculations include CO\u2082 only for the 2021 calendar year, the most up-to-date available. 2022 data will be available in December of 2023 and will be reported in future reports. We have identified a level of uncertainty around the reporting boundary, and the reported value is potentially overstated.\n\n13 2020 and 2021 values are restated due to a correction in the calculation methodology. Emissions from the Use of Sold Products and the End-of-Life Treatment of Sold Products were calculated using sales volumes for all Johnson & Johnson products combined with lifecycle assessment (LCA) models where sales volumes could be obtained; where they could not be obtained, sales revenues and average unit prices were used to estimate volumes. Due to the size of our product portfolio, LCAs were not performed for every Johnson & Johnson product, so products were placed into LCA categories, and a representative product LCA was applied.\n\n14 Emissions from the Processing of Sold Products, Downstream Leased Assets, Franchises and Investments are not applicable to Johnson & Johnson operations.\n\n15 GHGs covered in these calculations include CO\u2082 only.\n\n16 Includes site-specific data from all Johnson & Johnson manufacturing and R&D sites only.\n\n17 Results from completed projects. Based on fuel and electricity reduction calculations. Avoidance of energy consumption and GHG emissions calculated by comparing energy consumption before project implementation and expected consumption after implementation using engineering estimates at the time the projects are approved through an internal process.\n\n18 Municipal water, Groundwater, Rainwater and Surface water sources are considered as the \u2018Freshwater\u2019 category. Grey water & Other water sources are considered as the \u2018Other water\u2019 category.\n\n19 Certified to ISO 14001 or ISO 45001 means the site has received an external certification that is valid as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in sites with ISO 14001 certifications is driven in part by a decrease in overall Johnson & Johnson-owned manufacturing and R&D sites.\n\n20 The denominator of total manufacturing and R&D sites excludes small R&D and manufacturing sites (defined as having less than 50 employees) and newly acquired sites (i.e., owned less than three years as of December 31, 2022).\n\n21 Environmental non-compliances represent instances of non-compliance with environmental regulatory requirements or laws that were either (i) self-reported to authorities in the reporting year or (ii) identified by authorities and the non-compliance occurred in the reporting year. The authorities include regional, national, state/country/province and local/city regulatory agencies.\n\n22 Environmental non-compliances and fines paid exclude newly acquired sites (i.e., owned less than two years as of December 31, 2022).\n\n23 Fines paid for environmental non-compliances include those paid in the reporting year. It does not include fines assessed and/or under negotiation that were not paid as of December 31, 2022.\n\n24 The number of regulatory non-compliances has increased in 2022. Root cause analysis has been performed as needed and corrective actions have been identified.\n\n25 Totals include 3 BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology) certified sites.\n### Supply Base Overview\n\n|                      | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Number of Johnson & Johnson suppliers | 46,064 |

Values have been rounded. Due to rounding, the numbers presented do not add up precisely to the totals provided, and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.\n\n2 Supplier EcoVadis assessments are reported as of January 25, 2023 and may not capture suppliers that updated their assessment in January of 2023.\n\n3 Except Tier 2 diverse spend, all indicators represent spend Johnson & Johnson has control over addressable spend, defined as products and services that procurement teams can negotiate with suppliers to meet business goals.\n\n4 Total Global Impact Spend consists of: Tier 1 diverse supplier spend in the U.S. (billions) and countries outside the U.S., plus small business spend in the U.S., less overlap spend, plus Tier 2 diverse supplier spend, global (millions). U.S. suppliers can be classified as Tier 1 diverse and small business. The Tier 1 diverse & small business overlap is removed to avoid double counting of the spend.\n\n5 Suppliers can be designated in multiple diverse categories and each are counted in each category for which the supplier qualifies. Total Tier 1 diverse supplier spend in the U.S. (billions) counts the spend with each supplier once.\n\n6 A technical visit is a follow-up visit to the initial audit.\n\n7 We define a \u201ccritical finding\u201d as evidence of very high risk to human life or potential catastrophic impact to facility, community or environment. We expect suppliers and potential suppliers to address critical findings immediately.\n\n8 Social audits are conducted using the Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) protocol.\n\n9 Figures as of March 2023.\n\n10 In 2022, this Committee changed names.\n\n11 The tax information contained in this section is intended to provide the reader with an overview of all taxes contributed by Johnson & Johnson, and not just income taxes. It should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s tax information filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including in the most recently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. This tax information is supplemental to, and not a substitute for, the information reported in the Company\u2019s SEC filings.\n\n12 Certifiers include senior leaders at VP2 level and above, selected Managing Directors and General Managers based on country or business segment risk profile, and executives of recently acquired companies.\n\n13 OPDP: Office of Prescription Drug Promotion APLB: Advertising and Promotional Labeling Branch of the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.\n\n14 Johnson & Johnson Triage Committee and case investigators have the ability to change the issue type of the cases upon receipt in Our Credo Integrity Line. This occurred for no more than 16% in 2022.\n\n15 Product recall rate is defined as the number of lots removed from market per total globally manufactured, based on field action removals where it has been determined internally by a Quality Review Board, and aligned by Johnson & Johnson Enterprise Compliance, that there is a reasonable probability that the product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences and, in certain cases, will cause serious adverse health consequences.\n\n16 The Pharmaceutical and MedTech recall rates consider all products in each business segment. The Consumer Health product quality recall rate is inclusive of Consumer Health products from the Self-Care over-the-counter (OTC) business segment.\n\n17 As a result of sporadic attendance logs being kept during law enforcement trainings (stemming from potential security concerns), in 2022, only the number of training sessions was captured vs. number of attendees.\n\n18 All employees at Johnson & Johnson are trained on the Code of Business Conduct as well as what to do if they become aware of a product complaint or adverse event. Brand protection awareness is included in both of these mandatory trainings to raise understanding and awareness of illicit trade issues among all employees. Supplemental brand protection training is also available to stakeholders and is reflected in the number above.\nIndependent Assurance Statements\n\nIndependent Limited Assurance Statement to Johnson & Johnson on Health for Humanity 2025 Goals\n\nERM Certification and Verification Services Inc (\u201cERM CVS\u201d) was engaged by Johnson & Johnson Inc (\u201cJ&J\u201d) to provide limited assurance in relation to selected information reported in the Johnson & Johnson 2022 Health for Humanity Report, the Health for Humanity 2025 Goals Scorecard (together the \u201cReport\u201d) and on healthforhumanityreport.jnj.com\n\nOur conclusion\n\nBased on our activities, as described below, nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the selected information for the disclosures listed under \u2018Scope\u2019 above are not fairly presented in the Report, in all material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria.\n\nOur assurance activities\n\nConsidering the level of assurance and our assessment of the risk of material misstatement of the selected information a multi-disciplinary team of sustainability and assurance specialists performed a range of procedures that included, but was not restricted to,\n\n- Assessing the appropriateness of the reporting criteria for the selected information including review of the reporting principles, boundaries, definitions and internal guidelines for each of the Health for Humanity 2025 Goals.\n- A review of external media reporting relating to J&J to identify issues in the reporting period that may be relevant to the assurance scope.\n- Interviews with management representatives and other staff to understand and evaluate the relevant management systems and processes (including internal review and control processes) used for collecting and reporting the selected information.\n- A review at corporate level of a sample of qualitative and quantitative evidence supporting the selected information.\n- A review of the GHG and renewable energy data to confirm consistency with the findings of our separate GHG and renewable energy verification engagement including completeness and consistency.\n- Reviewing the presentation of information relevant to the scope of our work in the Report and on healthforhumanityreport.jnj.com to ensure consistency with our findings.\n\nThe limitations of our engagement\n\nThe reliability of the assured information is subject to inherent uncertainties, given the nature of some of the Health for Humanity 2025 Goals dependence on partner organisations to provide performance information, as well as the use of estimates, assumptions and extrapolations in determining the Selected information.

Johnson & Johnson\u2019s management is responsible for its assertion and for the selection of the criteria, which management believes provide an objective basis for measuring and reporting on the sustainability metrics. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on management\u2019s assertion based on our review.\n\nOur review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) in AT-C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements, and AT-C section 210, Review Engagements. Those standards require that we plan and perform the review to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to management\u2019s assertion in order for it to be fairly stated. The procedures performed in a review vary in nature and timing from, and are substantially less in extent than, an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management\u2019s assertion is fairly stated, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. Because of the limited nature of the engagement, the level of assurance obtained in a review is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had an examination been performed. We believe that the review evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our conclusion.\n\nWe are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement.\n\nThe firm applies the Statements on Quality Control Standards established by the AICPA and, accordingly, maintains a comprehensive system of quality control.\n\nThe procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment. In performing our review, we performed inquiries, performed tests of mathematical accuracy of computations on a sample basis, read relevant policies to understand terms related to relevant information about the sustainability metrics, reviewed supporting documentation in regard to the completeness and accuracy of the data in the sustainability metrics on a sample basis, and performed analytical procedures.\n\nBased on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to Johnson & Johnson\u2019s management assertion in order for it to be fairly stated.\n\nFlorham Park, New Jersey\nJune 2, 2023\n\n[Signature]\nJohnson & Johnson Management Assertion\nAs of or for the Year Ended December 31, 2022\n\nManagement of Johnson & Johnson is responsible for the completeness, accuracy, and validity of the sustainability metrics included in the tables below as of or for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the reporting year) for global operations, unless otherwise noted.

Management believes that management believes provide an objective basis for measuring and reporting on the sustainability metrics. The preparation of the sustainability metrics requires management to establish the criteria, make determinations as to the relevancy of information to be included, and make assumptions that affect reported information. The selection by management of different but acceptable measurement techniques could have resulted in materially different amounts or metrics being reported.\n\nOur Giving\n\n| Metric Description | Metric Value (in millions) |\n|--------------------|---------------------------|\n| Total products and cash contributed | $4,292 |\n| Products contributed | $3,925 |\n| Cash contributed | $367 |\n\n(a) Our contributions include products or cash donations made to qualified nonprofit entities (i.e., 501(c)(3) organizations in the U.S. or with an NGO source 501(c)(3) equivalency determination for organizations outside the U.S.) by Johnson & Johnson during the reporting year.
