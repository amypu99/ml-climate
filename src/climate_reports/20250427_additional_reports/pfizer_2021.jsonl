By remaining laser-focused on our purpose, we were able to achieve unprecedented progress in helping to address some of the world\u2019s most pressing challenges. I also realize there is still more we need to do, significant inequities that must be overcome, and real threats to our society and environment that lie ahead. I am confident we can rise to any challenge, just as we have in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMy confidence is grounded in my belief that Pfizer is fundamentally a different company today than it was just two years ago. By applying the lessons learned from our work to develop a COVID-19 vaccine and oral treatment, and by further embedding Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) principles into our core operations, we have transformed the way we discover, develop, finance, and deliver breakthroughs that change patients\u2019 lives. At the same time, external forces transforming societal and environmental norms, along with our internal commitment to equity as one of our core values, have reinforced the importance of integrating ESG into our day-to-day activities.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to focus on ways to make a meaningful and measurable impact. Never before has our impact been so wide-reaching when it comes to the number of patients treated or vaccinated with a Pfizer product. We reached an estimated 1.4 billion patients with our medicines and vaccines \u2013 roughly one out of every six people on Earth. Even when we separate out our breakthrough COVID-19 products, we treated an estimated 424 million patients globally.\n\nOur ESG strategy includes six priority areas: product innovation; equitable access and pricing; product quality and safety; diversity, equity and inclusion; climate change; and business ethics. Our progress on these areas is detailed in this report, and we look forward to engaging with colleagues and other stakeholders to hear how we can continue to enhance our impact, both within and outside of Pfizer. We also continue to refine the metrics we use to measure our performance as the voluntary and emerging regulatory frameworks governing ESG reporting evolve at the national, regional and global level.\n\nBreakthroughs and bold ambition\n\nThe significance of \u201cbreakthroughs\u201d has never been clearer than it is today as we continue to face COVID-19 variants and as unacceptable rates of morbidity and mortality from the virus endure. We are unwavering in our commitment to applying science and the dedication of our workforce to help end the pandemic and address inequities.\n\nWe also recognize that even as some people have received a booster dose of our vaccine, others are still waiting for their initial dose. We continue to believe we will more rapidly reach more people with our COVID-19 vaccine by continuing to scale our manufacturing capacity while maintaining quality and safety through the last mile. This is coupled with our unwavering support for multilateral organizations and governments with readiness programs \u2013 including lending our infrastructure expertise \u2013 so vaccine doses can more quickly translate into vaccinations anywhere in the world. These efforts have helped us remain on track to fulfill our pledge to deliver two billion doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to low- and middle-income countries by the end of 2022, having delivered the first billion by the end of 2021.\n\nWe also licensed our intellectual property for the COVID-19 oral treatment to the Medicines Patent Pool, which we hope will lead to expanded generic access pending country regulatory authorization or approval in low-income and lower-middle-income countries as well as some upper-middle income countries, accounting for approximately 53% of the world\u2019s population. I am proud of how quickly we identified pathways to facilitate more rapid and equitable access for our vaccine and treatment, respectively, and we will continue to push ourselves to meet patients\u2019 needs, wherever they may live.\n\n---\n\n1 Please refer to \u201cAbout This Report\u201d for explanation about Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA). Patient counts are estimates based on multiple data sources.\nColleagues at our core\n\nAs we scaled up physical capital to meet the needs of society with manufacturing and distribution, we recognized we would only achieve our bold goals if we simultaneously protected and nurtured our human capital. Our approximately 79,000 employees help us reach patients in more than 165 countries.\n\nAt Pfizer, our policies continue to focus on the safety of our colleagues and ways to support our people. We encourage everyone to be their authentic selves at work and are proud of our new and expanded colleague benefits and wellness offerings. In 2021, we partnered with Thrive Global, a wellness and organizational change initiative focused on colleague mental health and wellness. We also hosted two global listening sessions with more than 500 colleagues to discuss topics including allyship, racial bias, and how to have difficult conversations with empathy.\n\nWe believe that ESG is part of everyone\u2019s job at Pfizer: it\u2019s important to our colleagues, and we have linked performance on our goals to executive compensation to drive the behavior and culture changes required to achieve such ambitious and sustainable endeavors.\n\nWe have set key performance indicators (KPIs) and continue to evaluate additional goals to track our progress on priority issues and programs like greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction and diverse talent attraction, retention, and development. As a company with science embedded in our roots, branches, and leaves, we understand the importance of data and KPIs.\nLetter from our Chairman & CEO\n\n\u2014 Continued\n\nBold Moves and ESG Strategies \u2014 Working toward a common objective\n\nBack in 2019, we launched our Purpose Blueprint (including our new Purpose, Bold Moves, and Values), and it has served as our North Star in becoming the new Pfizer. Our ESG strategy was aligned to our Purpose Blueprint in 2020, and the close connection between efforts to advance our corporate and ESG strategies and report on our efforts helps accelerate our progress towards a long-term sustainable growth trajectory.\n\n**Bold Move 1: Unleash The Power Of Our People**\n\nWe are further building on our inclusive, engaging work environment to recognize and reward performance and leadership, and empower all colleagues to bring their authentic, best selves to work for the benefit of patients.\n\nImplemented in 2021, our new Global DEI Strategy and non-linear colleague growth model are helping us champion personal career journeys in line with our purpose. According to our survey results, 90% of colleagues reported feeling engaged, as measured by pride, a willingness to recommend Pfizer as a great place to work, and intent to stay, and 92% feel their work contributes to our purpose. In 2021, we also made progress toward our 2025 opportunity parity goal with a 3.4% increase of females globally and 3.5% increase of minorities in the U.S. at the Vice President level and above.\n\n**Bold Move 2: Deliver First-In-Class Science**\n\nWe aim to deliver first-in-class science by sourcing the best science in the world and significantly improving our innovation success rate through a focus on the most promising medical solutions.\n\nOur 2021 end-to-end clinical success rate for new molecular entities represents a four-fold increase from 2015. We began tracking FDA breakthrough designations as an independent measure of innovation that addresses unmet needs and delivery to patients as quickly as possible. From 2017 to 2021, 45% of Pfizer new molecular entity and novel biologics license applications approved by the FDA were designated as Breakthrough Therapies.\n\n**Bold Move 3: Transform Our Go-To-Market Model**\n\nWe are creating new solutions to address patient access and affordability challenges by exploring flexible business models that allow us to reach patients and improve their health care experience.\n\nNo single model is able to address access and affordability challenges for all products, which is why we work with a range of bilateral and multilateral partners to create solutions and help advance health equity. Based on our efforts to proactively address antimicrobial resistance (AMR), another growing public health challenge that has significant impact across the globe, Pfizer was recognized as a joint leader in the Access to Medicine Foundation Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Benchmark. We were recognized as the industry leader in the category of antibiotic stewardship, which includes strategies to expand access and ensure continuous supply and appropriate use of relevant products.\n\n**Bold Move 4: Win The Digital Race in Pharma**\n\nWe are continually exploring ways that digital, data and technology can accelerate our business, expedite the drug discovery and development process and enhance patient experiences and outcomes.\n\nThe pandemic has accelerated digital transformation drastically, and in 2021 we automated 90% of transactions on a baseline of 100 million transactions annually, exceeding the original goal of 75%. We have embedded the practice of working faster and leaner in 267 dedicated, cross-functional teams across the company to accelerate innovation and better respond to customer needs. Digital programs are also enabling us to better engage with patients and healthcare systems and this year we increased the number of programs to 38 in total. For example, our LivingWith\u2122 digital app provides valuable resources to approximately 90,000 cancer patients and their caregivers.\n\n**Bold Move 5: Lead The Conversation**\n\nWe are engaging with policymakers and other stakeholders to advocate for policies that allow innovation to flourish while helping ensure patient access to the latest vaccines and therapies \u2013 all while communicating the value our science brings to society.\n\nOne of the ways we measure our success is PatientView\u2019s annual \u2018Corporate Reputation of Pharma\u2019 survey, which asks more than 1,900 patient advocacy groups in 84 countries to assess pharmaceutical organizations across a range of important activities. In the 2020 Global PatientView survey, Pfizer ranked #2 amongst the largest 14 pharmaceutical companies thanks to our range of services and support \u201cbeyond the pill\u201d as well as our patient information score, which measures how usable and timely information is for patients.\nLooking ahead\n\nAdvancing science has never been more urgent or more important to meet society\u2019s needs in an ever-changing world. I am proud of how our employees have helped us further our purpose and the breakthroughs we achieved in 2021. As we tackle future threats to the health of people and our planet, I am confident that incredible things can happen when people come together to address a problem.\n\nThe future of medicine is happening at Pfizer, and we\u2019re committed to work together and with our partners to improve health around the world.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nDr. Albert Bourla\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\nDear Stakeholders,\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank you for your interest in Pfizer. I am pleased to share with you our 2021 ESG Report.\n\nOver the past two decades, we have observed an evolution in how Pfizer and our stakeholders think and talk about the importance of ESG topics. Today, ESG has evolved into the mainstream, and is factored into Pfizer\u2019s values, and our short- and long-term strategy. These topics have become a growing part of conversations we have with stakeholders \u2014 from shareholders, patients and colleagues and the communities in which we operate in and serve around the world. Accordingly, these topics have become key focus areas for Pfizer and the Board.\n\nIn recognition of the growing importance of ESG topics among our stakeholders, the Board more directly and explicitly formalized in 2020 its oversight of Pfizer\u2019s ESG efforts, with the Governance & Sustainability Committee assuming oversight responsibility of Pfizer\u2019s overall ESG strategy, reporting, policies and practices. The Committee receives regular updates from management on Pfizer\u2019s ESG priorities and the Company\u2019s progress against related metrics and targets. The Committee and management also discuss potential initiatives to further enhance Pfizer\u2019s ESG performance.\n\nAs a Board, we recognize that diversity, equity, and inclusion are growing interest areas among our stakeholders. In particular, at the Board level, we strive to maintain a Board that includes a diverse set of experiences, qualifications, attributes, and skills. Accordingly, the Board considers a diverse pool of qualified candidates across several dimensions, including skills, gender, age, race, ethnicity, background, professional experience, and perspectives, as evidenced by the addition of six new independent Directors since 2017.\n\nThe Board is fully engaged and supportive of Pfizer\u2019s ESG initiatives and continues to believe that our commitment to sustainability and corporate responsibility are essential to the Company\u2019s long-term success. We are proud to share Pfizer\u2019s progress on these efforts in this report and eager to hear responses and reactions from you.\n\nThank you for your interest on these important topics and we look forward to sharing updates as we further Pfizer\u2019s efforts.\n\nMr. Shantanu Narayen\nLead Independent Director\n2021 Progress and Highlights\n\n- **7%**\n  - Reduction in scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 2019 baseline\n\n- **4th**\n  - Consecutive year on CDP\u2019s Supplier Engagement Leaderboard\n\n- **15%**\n  - Reduction in water withdrawal and 13% reduction in hazardous and non-hazardous waste disposed compared to 2020\n\n- **1.4b**\n  - Estimated patients treated or vaccinated by a Pfizer product\n\n- **424m**\n  - Estimated patients treated excluding COVID-19 vaccines or treatments\n\n- **41.5%**\n  - Representation for women at VP+ levels globally\n\n- **25%**\n  - Representation for U.S. minorities at VP+ level\n\n- **21%**\n  - Clinical success rate (first-in-human to approval) for Pfizer new molecular entities by end of 2021\n\n- **3/12**\n  - 3 out of 12 board directors identify as ethnically diverse\n\n- **4/12**\n  - 4 out of 12 board directors are female\n\n- **3/12**\n  - 3 out of 12 board directors identify as ethnically diverse\n\n- **4/12**\n  - 4 out of 12 board directors are female\n\n---\n\n1 Patient counts are estimates based on multiple data sources.\nOur Approach To ESG\n\nAt the heart of Pfizer\u2019s ESG approach is the simple idea that our values and commitment to long-term sustainability is the way we strive to responsibly fulfill our purpose \u2013 **breakthroughs that change patients\u2019 lives** \u2013 build trust, and take accountability for the impact we make on society.\n\nESG issues are increasingly a priority to stakeholders, including shareholders. We recognize the impact of environmental issues on society and public health, and we seek to harness our cutting-edge science to create a healthier, more equitable world. We are committed to acting ethically, thoughtfully, and responsibly in all that we do. Guided by our purpose, we are focused on:\n\n**Environmental**\n- Climate action\n- Sustainable medicines\n- Resource conservation\n\n**Social**\n- Product innovation\n- Equitable access\n- Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)\n\n**Governance**\n- Continually prioritizing integrity and transparency in our business\nOur purpose is more important now than ever, as societal, environmental and economic shifts impact global health and health equity. In 2020, we laid the foundation to more intentionally connect our purpose with our ESG strategy in order to better understand and address the needs of patients, colleagues, partners, shareholders and communities. In 2021, we advanced this work by further embedding ESG throughout our corporate strategy, business operations, and governance structure.\n\nOur efforts included:\n\nEvolving Pfizer\u2019s approach to financing capital investments using ESG-related instruments. After launching the biopharmaceutical industry\u2019s first Sustainability Bond in 2020, we followed in 2021 by launching a second Sustainability Bond and establishing a $7 billion, 5-year revolving credit facility, which included ESG KPI-linked metrics focused on our long-term corporate goals and annual targets related to carbon emissions and diversity, equity & inclusion.\n\nEnhancing the rigor in the processes and controls used to govern the integrity of data used in our ESG metrics. We strengthened procedures, automated controls, and instituted practices used in Pfizer\u2019s financial reporting processes with the aim of increasing stakeholder confidence in our disclosures.\n\nEmbedding an ESG lens in our assessments of potential acquisitions, investments, and divestitures. Assessing ESG factors in the business development process is critical to mitigate potential risks to Pfizer\u2019s business, reputation, and commitment to our Purpose and Values, and to better understand the risk-adjusted value of a business or an asset. Potential partners need to be ready to stand out not only in terms of production and innovation but also in the realms of good corporate governance, environmental stewardship and commitment to social issues and community investment.\n\nAligning divisional strategies related to Pfizer\u2019s priority Environmental, Social, and Governance issues to tell a coherent narrative about our impact on society and enhance the rigor around public disclosures. As Pfizer expanded its DEI strategy in 2021, important ESG principles were taken into account and embedded formally in the governance structure.\nIdentifying priority issues and engaging with stakeholders\n\nOver the past year, we\u2019ve had important conversations with key internal and external stakeholders, including employees, investors, policymakers, patient advocacy groups, academia, and customers. Feedback received from stakeholders is critical to validate the results of our priority assessment, which was conducted in the second half of 2020. We intend to further enhance and systematize the processes by which we capture stakeholder feedback and consider the optimal frequency of conducting formal updates to our priority assessment in the future. In 2021, for example, we experienced an increase in the level of engagement we had on ESG-related priority issues with: patient advocates, employees, investors, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).\n\nPatient Advocacy Organizations\n\nIn 2021, Pfizer\u2019s Global Patient Advocacy Team engaged more than 1,800 global patient advocacy groups across North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia through trainings, workshops and webinars focused on health policy issues, capacity building, patient centricity and patient education and information.\n\nNon-governmental organizations (NGOs)\n\nPfizer has a long history of engaging with organizations advocating for access to medicines and vaccines, environmental concerns, transparency, and business ethics. As the COVID-19 pandemic and climate issues remained at the forefront in 2021, we increased the breadth and depth of communication with NGOs and coalitions. Among the organizations with which we experienced an increase in engagement included: Oxfam, Amnesty International, Doctors Without Borders, and Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n\nInvestors\n\nThrough written surveys and questionnaires, one-on-one conversations, and in public forums, we significantly increased our dialogue at multiple levels of the organization. Our Chairman and CEO addressed over 200 investors convened at the CECP Biopharma CEO Investor Forum and participated in the Morgan Stanley Sustainable Investing Summit. We held our first ESG investor event, which featured a fireside chat between Pfizer Board Director and Chair of the Governance & Sustainability Committee, Joseph Echevarria, and Rady Johnson, Pfizer Chief Compliance, Quality and Risk Officer. The event was broadcast publicly and described how the Board addresses ESG issues across multiple committees, and how our approach to ESG is integrated with the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program, which provides a framework for risk identification and management.\n\nColleagues\n\n2021 marked an inflection point in the breadth and depth of awareness and engagement by Pfizer colleagues in our ESG strategy, programs, and reporting. Colleagues were both inspired by the actions taken by the company to address issues related to our breakthroughs for COVID-19 and other diseases, and curious to find out what they could do to support our efforts. We raised internal awareness about our strategic approach to ESG through an enterprise-wide webinar, as well as conversations led by our Chief Sustainability Officer and our ESG Head with division leadership teams and departmental town halls.\nReporting on our highest priority issues\n\nThe priority assessment we conducted in 2020 helped map current ESG issues and the relative impact on our business and expectations of our external stakeholders. Through our analysis, we identified 30 topics, the most significant of which are discussed in this ESG Report. These have been mapped to our six ESG priority areas, which closely align to our Bold Moves outlined in our Purpose Blueprint, as well as the risks and opportunities identified with our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) approach.\n\nBased on the results of our 2020 assessment and subsequent stakeholder engagement in 2021, we sharpened the focus of our ESG strategy on these high priority topics, while also monitoring and managing the other issues from our assessment.\n\nWe recognize that our priority issues may evolve over time. We will continue to regularly engage with a wide variety of stakeholders to understand their changing needs, interests and expectations of Pfizer, and are committed to adjusting our approach as appropriate.\n\nIntegration with our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process\n\nThe ESG priorities were also informed by our ERM process, which provides a framework for risk identification and management, the outputs of which are reported to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Pfizer Corporate Audit facilitates the ERM process in coordination with Legal and Corporate Compliance and helps ensure that ERM is integrated into our strategic and operating planning process. For the first time, ESG risks were integrated into the ERM process in 2020. We will continue to further align our ESG, corporate strategy and ERM processes to enable a holistic view of risks and opportunities to help protect and enhance value.\nIn 2021, three focus areas stood out as key indicators of the progress we made against our ESG goals and commitments, as well as critical external drivers.\n\nThe sections that follow highlight our extensive work across these priorities, leading with our ongoing ambition to help ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. We also cover the global impact made through our Sustainability Bond as we further connect our ESG and financial strategies, as well as Pfizer\u2019s refreshed Global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strategy, which applies within our direct operations and beyond.\nFrom the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have worked relentlessly to leverage our decades of experience and expertise in development, testing, manufacturing and distribution, along with our partnerships, to work towards safe and effective vaccines and treatments for all. As a healthcare company, we understand human rights to be of the utmost relevance to our business, given the right to health\u2019s wide-ranging interconnections to other fundamental rights. Our responsibility to respect human rights extends across our entire product portfolio, but the pandemic has helped create an amplified urgency to ensure equitable access to vaccines and treatments against COVID-19.\n\nEquity is a core value of our company and has been the north star of our COVID-19 response. Clinical trial diversity played an important role in our COVID-19 vaccine development program, where we ensured that historically underrepresented participants had access to our COVID-19 vaccine trials, and where we enrolled racially and ethnically diverse participants reflecting the patient population where the burden of disease has been higher. It has also driven our ongoing collaboration with governments and key stakeholders around the world to work towards fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines while also providing our expertise and resources for novel approaches to help strengthen healthcare systems where greater support may be needed. We recognize that there is a lot of interest in every aspect of our work in relation to access to the COVID-19 vaccine and treatment and are grateful for all feedback. We remain open to and welcome partnership for new and creative ways to reach more people.\n\nIn order to accelerate our efforts to reach vulnerable populations, we pledged to provide 2 billion doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to low- and middle-income countries in 2021 and 2022 \u2013 at least 1 billion doses each year. Lower-middle-income and upper-middle-income countries are currently home to 75% of the world\u2019s population and 62% of the world\u2019s poor. We fulfilled this pledge in December 2021, with more than 1 billion doses delivered to 100 low- and middle-income countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Jordan, Ukraine, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia \u2013 among many others.\n\nAs part of this strategy, Pfizer is a proud partner and top contributor to the COVAX facility, a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines directed by the GAVI vaccine alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and the World Health Organization, alongside key delivery partners UNICEF and the Pan American Health Organization. In 2021, Pfizer worked with COVAX and government partners to enable supply of more than 250 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, more than 25% of the total COVAX supply in 2021. The U.S. Government was a critical partner in this effort, committing to purchase 1 billion doses at the not-for-profit price to donate to the 92 COVAX Advanced Market Commitment (AMC) countries as well as the member states of the African Union that are not already part of the AMC 92. More than 200 million of these doses were delivered in 2021, and the remaining 800 million will be delivered through 2022.\n\nVaccine distribution showing the 166 countries and territories where Pfizer doses were received in 2021\nVaccine Distribution and Partnerships\n\nWe know that it won\u2019t just be vaccines that will help bring an end to this pandemic, but vaccinations. Country readiness is critical in ensuring that vaccinations are successful. Based on our experience working with Ministries of Health and multilateral organizations during the unprecedented scale up of vaccination campaigns, we have seen multiple issues when it comes to supply planning and delivery, including, the ability to properly maintain product handling requirements, the availability of sufficient ultra-cold-chain (UCC) and traditional cold chain capacity, availability of essential supplies such as syringes and diluent, and resource and training limitations as well as lower uptake rates due to hesitancy. Without cold chain support, countries are not able to accept high volumes of vaccine that allow for robust and comprehensive vaccination campaigns. And, without service delivery and sufficient workforce capacity, vaccines in country will not result in vaccinations.\n\nDistributing these types of products rapidly and at national scale has no precedent in modern public health, and close coordination across all stakeholders is critical for ensuring the success of vaccination campaigns. Continued investment in readiness efforts in many lower income countries are still necessary to ensure that vaccines shipped effectively reach populations. We continue to partner with the global health community, governments and private industry to address these challenges.\n\nAs a few key examples:\n\n\u2022 Pfizer and the UPS Foundation are committed to accelerating the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccinations. The UPS Foundation is donating freezers to countries that need assistance with building out their ultra-cold chain capacity, and Pfizer provides guidance and experience in product supply. Our partnership leverages innovation in the healthcare cold chain to move our world forward by safely, securely and quickly delivering vaccines to areas where they are needed most.\n\n\u2022 As part of a four-year partnership with Zipline, Pfizer is supporting an innovative pilot initiative in Ghana, focused on delivering vaccines requiring cold-chain storage to hard-to-reach areas using drones. The initial success of the project suggests that the program could be quickly expanded to deliver doses of COVID-19 vaccines to remote regions across the world where Zipline operates.\n\n\u2022 Pfizer has signed a memorandum of understanding with Global Environment and Technology Foundation to collaborate with Project Last Mile. The partnership is focused on aligning the supply chain expertise and technical capabilities of Coca-Cola, a company whose supply chain is characterized as one of the widest reaching in the world, with technical expertise from Pfizer on vaccine handling, storage and administration in order to improve the availability of vaccines in developing countries, and, in particular, to those residing in and around the last mile of the medical supply chain in Africa.\nThrough our ongoing efforts and initiatives, we remain fully focused on getting high-quality, safe and effective vaccines to patients all over the world as quickly as possible to help end the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPfizer\u2019s purpose is to bring breakthroughs that change patients\u2019 lives. With the people most in need always in mind, we will continue to work towards a future where disease doesn\u2019t win, but science does. We recognize and are concerned by the complex evolution of the pandemic and how it continues to have severe impacts on individuals, families and communities. We continue to regularly evaluate the risks it poses to people, particularly in the most vulnerable geographies, and among the most vulnerable groups of society. No single organization or company can solve the equity challenge alone.\n\nWe are committed to continue evolving and improving our response to this pandemic where we can, and we strongly welcome the opportunity to engage with others to share challenges, lessons learned and to build collaborative solutions to improve equitable healthcare access globally. The right to health remains one of our most salient priorities, with availability, accessibility and affordability standing as key areas of focus.\nFinancing for a Sustainable Future\n\nEmbedding our commitment to ESG into our corporate and financial strategies\n\nAt Pfizer, our commitment to ESG helps us advance our purpose and drive positive impacts relevant to the breakthroughs we aim to deliver. In 2021, we took steps to further embed our commitment to ESG into all aspects of our corporate strategy, including applying an ESG discipline to our financing approach to help fight the pandemic, reduce our environmental footprint and improve diverse representation at our company.\n\nThis past August, we continued to focus our efforts by reapplying an ESG lens to our capital raising strategies by issuing a second Sustainability Bond, this time raising $1.0 billion. We followed the same path as we did in 2020, by assembling a cross-functional team to assess the benefits associated with issuing a second Sustainability Bond. We leveraged the Sustainability Bond Framework we established in 2020 when we issued the biopharmaceutical industry\u2019s first such bond, which raised $1.25 billion. Proceeds from the 2020 Sustainability Bond are being used to help manage our environmental impact and to support increased patient access to Pfizer\u2019s medicines and vaccines, especially among underserved populations, and to strengthen health care systems.\n\nProceeds from the August 2021 Sustainability Bond were used to support the research and development (R&D) expenses related to our COVID-19 vaccine R&D, and capital expenditures in connection with the manufacture and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nFrom day one, Pfizer\u2019s strategy to address COVID-19 has been anything but business as usual. Our goal has been and will continue to be scaling capacity to provide enough COVID-19 vaccine doses on an equitable basis to reach all who choose it. On the R&D front, we considered the social impact of the vaccine in the Phase 3 clinical trial R&D process, which included a diversity of countries, diversity in race and ethnicity, and diversity in age categories. Given the impact of the pandemic on people living in low- and middle-income countries and the need to bolster public health systems, we believe directing resources towards these COVID-19 investments qualified under the International Capital Market Association\u2019s Social Bond Principles.\n\nDemand for ESG bonds has surged, following the increased investor focus on environmental issues and economic inequality. In 2020 there was $800 billion in global sustainable debt issuance. That figure more than doubled in 2021 to $1.6 trillion, including $530 billion in sustainability-linked loans and bonds. Pfizer\u2019s two Sustainability Bonds issuances enabled us to publicly highlight our efforts in the ESG space. The latest issuance also allowed us to capitalize on the continued strong demand for ESG-themed debt amongst fixed income investors, with a number of major investors upgrading their internal ESG ratings on Pfizer based on the bond marketing materials.\n\nFurther embedding an ESG discipline in our financing strategy, in 2021, we became the first U.S. biopharmaceutical company to include ESG Key Performance Indicator (KPI)-linked metrics in our $7 billion, 5-year revolving credit facility. The metrics specifically focus on our corporate goals to reduce carbon emissions at our locations around the world, as well as promoting more diversity in leadership among women globally and minorities in the U.S.\n\nPfizer\u2019s strategic focus on creating more opportunities to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion across our workforce and those with whom we do business extended to our financial strategy, and in 2021, we expanded our financing initiatives through capital market activities and money market fund investments, which aim to support women, minority and disabled veteran-owned firms.\n\n---\n\n1 Sustainable Debt Issuance Breezed Past $1.6 Trillion in 2021; BloombergNEF, Bloomberg, L.P., January 12, 2022\n\n---\n\n| 2021 Sustainability Bond - Allocation of Proceeds | 2020 Full Year Actual | 2021 Full Year Actual | Spend Through 2021 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| $ in Millions                                 |                      |                      |                   |\n| Research & Development                        | 401                  | 688                  | 1,090             |\n| Capital Expenditures                          | 168                  | 535                  | 703               |\n| Total                                         | 569                  | 1,223                | 1,792             |\n\nAllocation of proceeds for the August 2021 Sustainability Bond was up to $1 billion which was fully allocated as of year-end 2021.\nPost Issuance Transparency\n\nTo the extent that 2020-2021 was about putting ESG in the spotlight, 2022 is likely to be about bringing accountability center stage. Pfizer is committed to post-issuance transparency by measuring and reporting on the impact we have on society and the environment resulting from investments we make with Sustainability Bond proceeds.\n\nWe aligned our \u2018use of proceeds\u2019 from the March 2020 $1.25 billion Sustainability Bond to several relevant United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets, including SDGs 3, 6, 7, 9, and 12.

Pfizer has allocated $270 million of the Sustainability Bond proceeds to replenish The Pfizer Foundation, a charitable organization established by Pfizer Inc. with distinct legal restrictions that works to help address the challenges of a complex and evolving global health landscape.\n\nGiven that infectious diseases are responsible for an estimated seven million deaths annually, are a leading cause of disability, and often perpetuate the cycle of poverty, The Pfizer Foundation is focused on accelerating innovative solutions and improving health systems to help address the urgent threat of infectious diseases through its Infectious Disease (I.D.) Impact Initiative.\n\n- The Pfizer Foundation is working with Save the Children in Kenya to address pneumonia, the leading cause of preventable death in children worldwide. The partnership works to help ensure children receive high quality routine immunizations and equip healthcare workers with tools to help improve child health services.\n- Also in Kenya, The Pfizer Foundation is partnering with AMPATH to help address antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by improving healthcare worker capacity to generate reliable data to inform clinical practice and improve infectious disease care.\n- In Ghana, The Pfizer Foundation is working with PharmAccess to help improve the quality and availability of essential medicines by using digital tools to improve the supply chain and identify substandard or counterfeit products that can drive antimicrobial resistance (AMR).\n- In Indonesia, The Pfizer Foundation is partnering with Jhpiego to help strengthen long-term capacity, improve primary care and upskill healthcare workers to reduce childhood mortality and support government efforts to advance universal health coverage.\n- In Uganda, The Pfizer Foundation is working with World Vision to contribute to reductions in childhood mortality by strengthening community-level prevention, diagnosis, and treatment to improve access to quality care.\n- In 2020, The Pfizer Foundation launched \u2018Innovation Awards in Community Health,\u2019 a new program in partnership with Direct Relief to support innovative approaches to help improve infectious disease education, screening, testing, treatment, and care through federally qualified health centers and safety clinics in the U.S.\n\nAs the burden of infectious disease grows, particularly among underserved communities, local innovators are bringing new and creative thinking to the fight against these threats. By partnering with civil society, governments, and other private sector organizations, we can help expedite the development of solutions that help address these healthcare inequities.\n\nThe Pfizer Foundation\u2019s Global Health Innovation Grants (GHIG) program, which is part of the Infectious Disease (I.D.) Impact Initiative, provides funding and technical support to health-focused entrepreneurs and social enterprises in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Initiatives seek to address systemic challenges through training for health providers, implementation of clinics in remote areas, establishing digital health access and more.\n\n| People with improved care for infectious diseases (cumulative) through support from The Pfizer Foundation\u2019s Infectious Disease (I.D.)

CREDITS: Save The Children\nAntimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Action Fund\n\nApproximately 700,000 people die around the world each year from AMR, and the burden is expected to surge in the coming years: as many as 10 million people could die annually from AMR by 2050.\n\nThere is broad consensus among governments, academia, industry, and public health agencies that the world urgently needs new antibiotics. The creation of the AMR Action Fund represents one of the most significant and collaborative steps taken to date to address the problem.\n\nIn 2020, Pfizer pledged $100 million to support the AMR Action Fund, a collaboration of more than 20 biopharmaceutical companies that aims to bring two to four new antibiotics to patients by 2030. Pfizer plans to use proceeds from the Sustainability Bond to invest $20 million over 5 years. The AMR Action Fund, which includes a representative from Pfizer on its Board of Directors, is the world\u2019s largest public-private partnership supporting antibiotic R&D. The Fund expects to invest approximately $1 billion in the coming years in clinical-stage biotechs developing antibiotics and other anti-infectives that target World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) priority drug-resistant pathogens. These investments are expected to help bring novel antibiotics to market and, importantly, re-establish an innovation ecosystem to support long-term antibiotic development.\n\nIn recent months, the Fund has taken critical steps toward operationalizing, including appointing a CEO, a board chair, and an independent scientific advisory board that will evaluate the global health impact and scientific merit of potential investments. The Fund expects to make its first round of investments in early 2022, and it will continue participating in high-profile global health and policy events to sound the alarm on the AMR crisis and build support for appropriate solutions.\n\nSayana\u00ae Press\n\nAn estimated 190 million women of reproductive age worldwide would like to delay or prevent pregnancy but are not using any method of contraception.\n\nPfizer Inc. and a consortium of partners are part of a public-private collaboration to broaden access to Sayana\u00ae Press, Pfizer\u2019s long-acting, injectable and reversible contraceptive. The all-in-one prefilled, single-use, auto-disable system eliminates the need to prepare a needle and syringe. It also allows the contraceptive to be administered by a health worker outside of a clinical setting, or it can be self-injected if approved locally and after health care worker instruction.\n\nBecause of its unique contraceptive delivery technology \u2013 enabling the product to be compact, discreet, and easily transportable \u2013 Sayana\u00ae Press can be provided in low-resource, non-clinic settings, potentially transforming the way in which women can access and receive their preferred method of contraception.\n\nPfizer completed its investment in 2021 to establish a new automated filling line for the Uniject\u2122 injection system, which delivers the contraceptive. In total, Pfizer allocated $39 million from the bond proceeds to fund the capital expense. Once operational, this new filling line will allow for capacity to scale from 23 million units per year to up to 30 million units per year. The new automated filling line will undergo process validation and EU regulatory review in 2022, and is expected to enter into commercial production in 2023.\nEnvironmental Investments\n\nAligned with Pfizer\u2019s ongoing commitment to limit the environmental impact of our operations, the Sustainability Bond launched in March 2020 included planned investments in environmental projects.\n\nThe Bond was confirmed as aligned with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2018 (GBP 2018) and Social Bond Principles 2018 (SBP 2018) by Sustainalytics. As of December 31, 2021, $401 million in net proceeds from the Sustainability Bond issuance have been allocated to environmental projects supporting green design and construction of new office and manufacturing facilities.\n\nThrough the application of proceeds from the 2020 Sustainability Bond, Pfizer is designing a new multi-product API manufacturing facility in Tuas, Singapore. Design priorities include integration of systems and technologies to increase energy efficiency and enable effective energy demand management. The design is being informed through identification of the largest energy consuming systems and processes enabling evaluation of opportunities for reduction of electrical and thermal loads. This analysis includes use of benchmarking studies to identify good practices, including incorporation of a comprehensive metering infrastructure facilitating early investigation and action of energy demand changes. Currently the Tuas project is in the detailed design phase and is on track for completion in 2023.\n\nThe proceeds are also being used to advance sustainable design principles in Pfizer\u2019s new corporate headquarters in Hudson Yards, New York City. This new Pfizer facility is being designed to meet or exceed the Gold level of two independent certification standards including the US Green Building Counsel (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEEDv4) standard and the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI) WELLv2 Pilot Standard. The design includes maximizing the use of natural lighting, reducing lighting power demand 30% below the LEEDv4 baseline, water use management through incorporation of low flow plumbing fixtures, and enabling effective energy management through installation of advanced energy metering and energy performance modeling. Construction of the new facility is expected to be completed by end of 2022.\n\nIn addition to the Use of Proceeds from the Sustainability Bond, please refer to the \u2018E\u2019 section for further information about other environmental initiatives Pfizer is progressing to help limit environmental impact.\n\nFuture Impact Reporting\n\nPfizer is committed to measuring progress in the impact our investments are making on society and the environment. Due to the long-term nature of certain investments, we plan to continue to report on progress in deploying the capital, completion of the projects, and the impact on society.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, $401 million in net proceeds from the 2020 Sustainability Bond issuance have been allocated to environmental projects supporting green design and construction of new office and manufacturing facilities.\nPfizer\u2019s vision is to be a best-in-class organization that embeds diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) into our workplace and our purpose. To bring our vision to life, we undertook a review of our DEI strategy and updated the strategy, priorities and governance model in 2021.\n\nWe used the opportunity to \u201cembed DEI into our DNA\u201d with this updated approach, working together with our Enterprise Colleague Resource Groups and leadership across the business to develop the new approach. The updated overarching DEI vision is supported by clear roles and accountabilities, alignment of our business, and transparent planning to track our progress against measurable outcomes.\n\nOur refreshed approach is outcomes-focused and revolves around three key stakeholder groups and pillars, which create a strong foundation to develop an inclusive workplace for all. Our goals with this structure are to improve diversity, foster belonging, aim to conduct inclusive research, improve health outcomes, remove barriers to access, improve partner diversity and contribute to a more equitable society.\n\nThe pillars of our strategy include:\n\n**Build A More Inclusive Colleague Experience**\nBuild A More Inclusive Colleague Experience focuses on improving diversity and fostering belonging for all colleagues across the talent lifecycle, from potential recruits and part-time employees to full-time colleagues and contractors. We also aim to foster belonging by connecting colleagues in a more meaningful and authentic way, reducing barriers to equity and creating a culture that celebrates all. In a first for Pfizer, we hosted two listening sessions in 2021 following the Afghanistan refugee crisis in August and during two high profile U.S. court trials in November (Kyle Rittenhouse and Ahmaud Arbery). Over 500 colleagues attended and the discussions included allyship, Muslim bias, how to have difficult conversations with empathy, and other topics where people were able to express their views respectfully. These global safe spaces are one example of how we are institutionalizing activities that support our people.\n\n**Advance Equitable Health Outcomes**\nAdvance Equitable Health Outcomes focuses on current and future patients, as well as those who impact and influence their lives and healthcare decisions. We will conduct inclusive research by ensuring our R&D activities, including disease priorities and clinical trials, reflect the diversity of the communities we serve. We believe that we can help improve health outcomes by preventing, identifying, treating, and/or mitigating disease drivers that disproportionately impact underserved populations. Our goal is to remove barriers to access by increasing access and affordability for patients in historically underserved communities. Advancing equitable health outcomes starts with increasing diversity in our trials and considering access from early research and development through pre-launch and commercialization.\n\n**Transform Society with External DEI Partnerships**\nTransform Society with External DEI Partnerships focuses on partners and suppliers we work with, as well as the broad set of stakeholders we engage with to impact society. We believe that working with diverse suppliers will empower underrepresented communities through opportunity and education. We aim to contribute towards a more equitable society by partnering to deploy capital, colleague volunteer hours, and know-how to amplify equity initiatives and help make the world a more equitable place. Over 8,000 colleagues volunteered more than 43,700 hours in 2021 and donated $16.7 million together with the Pfizer Foundation.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nRefreshing Our DEI Strategy\n\u2014 Continued\n\nOur progress on our equity commitments and programs will be measured against 16 outcome metrics and 35 key initiatives. We are focused on operationalizing this new strategy and tracking progress against our metrics while also establishing other key performance indicators to hold us accountable and to ensure our work is having a meaningful impact on society. Our aim is to embed our value of equity with our people/colleagues, patients, and our society by ensuring they are seen, heard, and cared for.\n\nLearn more about our diversity and belonging efforts, inclusive research, and partnerships work in the Social section of the report.\n\nHEALTH EQUITY CANNOT BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT RESEARCH EQUITY\n\nAt Pfizer we recognize that in order to better understand individuals\u2019 health needs and the impact of our medicines across all people, our research activities must represent diverse communities and the diseases we aim to address. That\u2019s why we\u2019re working diligently to close the gap in health disparities in minority and underserved populations by applying medical, scientific, and translational expertise to do more precise and targeted disease management and achieve greater equity in research.\n\nIn November 2021, Pfizer launched the Institute of Translational Equitable Medicine, or ITEM, under the Office of the Chief Medical Officer. Our vision for ITEM is to achieve health equity by preventing, treating, and identifying disease drivers that disproportionately impact underserved and minority populations nationally and globally. We believe there are gaps in applying scientific knowledge to diseases, and inefficiencies in recognizing unmet clinical needs that ought to inform fundamental research. Our goal is to use data to help us understand the drivers of health inequities, and how our scientific discoveries can meet the needs of underrepresented and minority patients.\n\nTo that end, the institute\u2019s initiatives will span three key dimensions: research, development, and medical activities leveraging science, data, and translational expertise to close gaps in health disparities. ITEM will strive to integrate equity across our end-to-end development pipeline, by delivering on the following key objectives:\n\n\u2022 Directing our research to understand the root cause of healthcare disparities in diseases across our development portfolio\n\u2022 Identifying new targets of diseases that are inclusive of underrepresented minorities, and for the benefit of all populations\n\u2022 Amplifying precision medicine by including minorities and identifying root causes of disparities\n\u2022 Collaborating with colleagues across Pfizer to enhance key initiatives focused on patient centricity, health equity, and social determinants of health.\n\u2022 Engaging and partnering with the communities that are most impacted by the inequity\n\nIn the drive to achieve health equity, there is always more work to be done. We are passionate about embedding equity at the very beginning of our R&D process, and every step along the way.\nAs planetary health impacts public health, we are committed to limiting our impact on the environment and the climate. Our company purpose \u2013 Breakthroughs that change patients\u2019 lives \u2013 guides our environmental priorities, with a focus on impact reduction, conservation of resources and the reduction of waste arising from our operations.\n\n**Climate Change**\n- Our 2030 Climate Ambitions\n- Reducing Emissions From Our Operations\n- Accelerating Action Across Our Supply Chain\n- Proactive External Engagement\n- Understanding How Climate Change Could Impact Our Business\n\n**Sustainable Medicines**\n- Pharmaceuticals In The Environment\n- Waste\n- Water Stress\n\n---\n\n**How our approach to environmental sustainability supports the SDGs**\n\n**Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure**\nWe promote resilient and sustainable infrastructure, scientific research and innovation.\n\n**Responsible Consumption and Production**\nWe aim to achieve environmentally sound life cycle management and adopt sustainable practices.\n\n**Climate Action**\nThrough our goals we are taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.\n\nMore information on the SDGs [here](#).\nEnvironment\n\nClimate Change\n\nClimate change has the potential to impact public health in a myriad of ways. As a biopharmaceutical company, Pfizer is uniquely positioned to help address the global health challenges resulting from climate change. We\u2019re applying the power of science and engineering to contribute to solutions to these challenges and innovating to bring products to the market that may tackle health conditions linked to climate, such as treatments for various vector and waterborne diseases.\n\nOur 2030 climate ambitions\n\nPfizer is dedicated to becoming carbon neutral across our internal operations by 2030. Through our fourth-generation greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets, approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in February 2021 as aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C trajectory, we are committed to:\n\n| Target | Progress |\n|--------|----------|\n| Reducing scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 46% from a 2019 baseline | Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in 2021 were 0.8% lower than 2020 in spite of production increases, including COVID-19 vaccine production. Emissions for 2021 were 7% lower than the 2019 baseline. The majority of this decrease is attributed to pandemic response including reduction of office and in field sales operations. |\n| Sourcing 80% purchased renewable electricity by 2025, and 100% by 2030 | Pfizer sourced 6.5% renewable electricity in 2021 and entered into a virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) for 310 MWh of renewable energy beginning in 2023 to help drive progress against our goal. |\n| Reducing emissions from upstream transportation and distribution by 10% and from business travel by 25% by 2025 from a 2019 baseline | Transportation and distribution of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, transported predominantly by air using cold chain technologies, contributed to an increase in upstream logistics emissions in 2021. Additionally, the urgent need for certain Pfizer products to treat COVID-19 patients prompted a shift from ocean to air transportation, further increasing logistics emissions. Business travel continued to be impacted by pandemic-related travel restrictions throughout 2021. Travel-related GHG emissions were 92% lower than the 2019 baseline. Going forward we will continue to utilize digital tools to reduce travel. |\n| Working to accelerate change across our supply chain, driving 64% of our suppliers of goods and services by spend to also set science-based GHG emission reduction goals | Pfizer\u2019s response to the pandemic, including the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and oral treatment, resulted in a significant increase in purchased goods and services spend in 2021. Currently 10% of our suppliers by spend have GHG emission reduction targets approved by SBTi. Beginning in 2022 we intend to expand reporting to include suppliers that have set science-based targets but have not pursued approval through SBTi. |\nReducing Emissions From Our Operations\n\nOur manufacturing and R&D sites have long-term environmental sustainability masterplans to reduce impact, including actions ranging in scale and complexity. We seek opportunities to design new facility or renovation projects with reduced environmental impact (such as energy consumption, water usage and waste management) so we can deliver greener buildings. For example, we aim to replace equipment at end-of-life with energy-efficient alternatives. We invest in no/low carbon technologies at our sites and in contractual agreements that enable sourcing of clean energy from renewable sources. We also undertake process enhancements within our product manufacturing to reduce the number of steps and resources required.\n\nIn October 2021, Pfizer entered into a virtual power purchase agreement (PPA) with Vesper Energy (Vesper). Under this 15-year agreement, Vesper will deliver 310 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy to the grid from the Hornet Solar project in west Texas beginning in 2023. Once operational, we expect Pfizer\u2019s North American purchased electricity needs, which comprise approximately 50% of electricity use globally, will effectively be met through solar energy.\n\nWe are currently working to establish a virtual PPA in Europe, which represents approximately 16% of our global electricity footprint, and aim to secure renewable energy certificates to address the remainder of our purchased electricity by 2025. As outlined by our goals and demonstrated through our commitment to RE100, we expect electricity generated by our operations will be transitioned to renewable sources by 2030. We plan to address any residual emissions through high-quality and verifiable offsets.\n\nAccelerating Action Across Our Supply Chain\n\nPfizer\u2019s scope 3 (value chain) GHG footprint is more than four times that associated with the company\u2019s direct operations. We recognize action is needed throughout our value chain to address the complex threat of climate change. The procurement of goods and services, essential to producing medicines and vaccines, is the most significant contributor to our scope 3 emissions. Therefore, we are urging all our suppliers to commit to ambitious, science-based GHG reduction targets and have integrated environmental criteria in our supplier sourcing, contracting, and performance management processes. We are asking our suppliers to establish their GHG baseline no later than the end of 2022 and to set reduction targets aligned with SBTi guidance for their scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by the end of 2025. In 2021, Pfizer was recognized as a CDP Supplier Engagement Leader for the fourth consecutive year for our work to measure and reduce environmental risks in our supply chain.\n\nPfizer is proud to be part of Energize, a first-of-its-kind collaboration launched in November 2021 between 10 global pharmaceutical companies to engage suppliers in decarbonization of the pharmaceutical value chain through renewable energy procurement. The program, which is designed and delivered by Schneider Electric, will enable pharmaceutical suppliers to learn more about renewable energy adoption and contracting. This will offer suppliers\u2014which may not otherwise have the internal resources or expertise available\u2014the opportunity to participate in the market for PPAs.\nProactive External Engagement\n\nVoluntary measures, such as those being taken by Pfizer and many other companies around the world, often offer the greatest opportunity for companies to design innovative solutions that work best for their particular situation, product range, and investment timelines. Tackling climate change, however, will require action from all parties across all sectors, and Pfizer urges governments both in the U.S. and abroad to establish ambitious climate policies to stabilize global temperature rise at 1.5 degrees.\n\nFor additional information on Pfizer\u2019s climate action program, please see our:\n\n- Climate Change Position Statement\n- 2021 CDP Climate Change Response\n\nUnderstanding How Climate Change Could Impact Our Business\n\nWe are committed to transparency in evaluating the risks and opportunities that climate change may present to our business. To meet this commitment, we incorporate the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework into our enterprise risk management governance process and voluntary report aligned with TCFD recommendations. See our TCFD Response on page 76.\nPharmaceuticals in the Environment\n\nPharmaceuticals in the environment is the signature environmental issue for our industry. We are committed to limiting environmental impact of discharges from manufacturing processes and we participate in the Pharmaceutical Product Stewardship Work Group (PPSWG) in the United States and MEDSdisposal in Europe to enable proper disposal of unused medicines.\n\nRecognizing the threat to human health from antimicrobial resistance (AMR), we have a significant focus on antibiotics. The AMR Industry Alliance (AMRIA) report demonstrates greater transparency and progress by the Alliance. Pfizer\u2019s progress in driving a responsible manufacturing strategy, including risk assessments against published science-based discharge targets (Predicted No Effect Concentrations), was positively recognized through both the 2020 and 2021 Access to Medicine AMR Benchmarks. We remain committed to our goal of meeting industry targets for antibiotics by 2025.\n\nPfizer is also leading the development of an industry standard with the sponsorship of AMRIA. Once the standard is finalized, the next step is to create a certification scheme, supporting the standard, to further demonstrate responsible manufacturing of antibiotics. We intend to certify our antibiotics to this standard.\n\nEnvironment\n\n\u2014 Continued\n\nSustainable Medicines\n\nPfizer has a long history of using the concepts of green chemistry and promoting them across the industry. Through scientific innovation we aim to design more efficient processes that can reduce the environmental impact of our medicines throughout the product life cycle.\n\nTo support environmental footprint reduction efforts, Pfizer is conducting life cycle assessments (LCAs) across our small molecule, large molecule, and device portfolios. Guided by these assessments, we are working to define environmental sustainability criteria across the product lifecycle.\n\nFor example, through LCAs we have determined 70% to 90% of the carbon footprint of our small molecule products is associated with the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), while the remainder is attributed to packaging, excipients, and other elements. Many factors contribute to the carbon footprint of API: manufacturing equipment, number of process steps, route efficiency and use of higher intensity materials such as precious metal catalysts used in the manufacturing process. Organic solvents commonly employed to allow the necessary conditions for chemical reactions to progress represent one of the most significant contributors to the API carbon footprint.\n\nWe continue to evaluate ways to reduce the environmental impact of our products through the use of new technology, application of green chemistry, and solvent recycling and reuse.\nEnvironment\n\u2014 Continued\n\nWaste\nAmong the priorities of sustainable medicines design work is the minimization of waste. We pursue process improvements in our existing manufacturing operations through next-generation design projects. In addition, our manufacturing sites look for opportunities to reduce, reuse and recycle other materials. Pfizer uses a metric that encourages the hierarchy of control of handling waste: reduce, reuse, recycle, disposal. Each site has targets to improve the circularity of their waste and we benchmark our performance against others in our industry.\n\n**TRACKING OUR PROGRESS**\nTotal hazardous and nonhazardous waste generation decreased by 18% in 2021 compared to 2020. We continue to focus our efforts on waste minimization and, where waste can\u2019t be avoided, identifying options for reuse or recycling.\n\nWe work to find beneficial uses for materials we can\u2019t reuse and have shared some examples of success in the following case study.\n\n**Water Stress**\nThe availability of clean water is a basic human need globally and must be addressed locally. Our recently published Water Stewardship position statement describes our efforts to be good stewards of water with a particular focus on water stressed areas. To learn more about our efforts, see our position statement.\n\n**TRACKING OUR PROGRESS**\nWater withdrawal in 2021 was 15% lower than 2020, and water discharges for the same period decreased 18%. Pfizer\u2019s water consumption in 2021 was 14% of water withdrawal, a 2% increase compared to 2020.\n\n**CASE STUDY: KALAMAZOO SOLVENT RECOVERY**\nOur Kalamazoo, Michigan site operates a solvent recovery facility. Distillation columns recover spent solvent blends which are then reused in onsite manufacturing processes or are sold for reuse by other manufacturers. During calendar year 2021, the Kalamazoo site recovered more than 50% of the total quantity of solvents used in its production operations thereby reducing the amount of solvent purchased and waste sent to off-site disposal. The site continues to evaluate opportunities to increase spent solvent reuse.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to introduce uncertainty and fluid challenges, heightening our business imperative to harness scientific innovation to help create a healthier, more equitable world for all. While we are continually redoubling our efforts to try to stay one step ahead of COVID-19 as it evolves, we remain focused on helping to address the burden on individuals, their families, and communities from other equally debilitating infectious and chronic diseases. Through our partnerships and programs, we aim to expand access to our breakthrough medicines and vaccines, particularly among underserved communities. Our societal priorities extend to people across the globe and within our own workforce and supply chain, as we invest in our human capital and work to advance diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nInnovation and Global Health\n- Product Innovation\n- Equitable Access and Pricing\n- Healthcare Infrastructure\n- Patient-Centric Design\n\nHuman Capital\n- Colleague Engagement\n- Colleague DEI\n- Colleague Resource Groups\n- Opportunity Parity\n- Partnerships\n- Pay Equity\n- Colleague Growth and Development\n- Health, Safety and Wellbeing\n- Our Pandemic Response\n\nHow our approach to social issues supports the SDGs\n\n| SDG | Description |\n|-----|-------------|\n| 32  | Good Health and Well-Being |\n| 5   | Gender Equality |\n| 8   | Decent Work and Economic Growth |\n| 10  | Reduced Inequalities |\n| 17  | Partnerships for the Goals |\n\nWe aspire to ensure health and well-being for all at all ages through equitable access to medicines and vaccines.\n\nWe aim to end discrimination against women, ensure equal opportunities for leadership and access to reproductive health.\n\nWe promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment, and decent and safe working environments.\n\nWe empower and promote the social and economic inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status.\n\nWe are working to create new partnerships to help attain relevant sustainable development goals.\n\nMore information on the SDGs [here](#).\nSocial\n\nInnovation and Global Health\n\nThe global health landscape continues to face a crisis of unprecedented dimensions. The COVID-19 pandemic has not only reversed progress made in the well-being and longevity of humanity, but the duration and future course of the pandemic remains unknown. Also uncertain are the implications for individuals suffering from other equally debilitating and deadly diseases or conditions, from cancer to pneumonia, as health care providers are overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients and routine procedures are canceled or delayed. Innovation is among the most vital tools we can rely upon to help navigate these unchartered waters.\n\nOur colleagues have continued to work tirelessly to help address evolving impacts of COVID-19 in addition to persistent pre-pandemic infectious and chronic diseases. Established in 2018, our Infectious Disease (I.D.) Impact Initiative is Pfizer\u2019s long-term global health commitment to redefine the way we fight infectious disease and help protect underserved people in the U.S. and around the world from deadly threats. But we realize we cannot overcome global health challenges alone. Partnerships, whether it be among private entities or through public-private means, are more critical than ever before.\n\nProduct Innovation\n\nTrue to Pfizer\u2019s Purpose, our priority is bringing to market innovations that positively impact patients. Over the last decade, we\u2019ve been taking a hard look at our productivity, sharpening our focus, and implementing changes across dimensions. From our deep understanding of biology, doubling down on new modalities, and efforts to empower our scientists for critical decision-making, Pfizer\u2019s pipeline\u2014including 89 programs in development from Phase 1 through registration (as of February 8, 2022)\u2014reflects the scientific opportunity brought about by our focus on improvement.\n\nOur approach is translating to results as we accelerate new medicines to market. We continue to see improvement in our Phase 2 success rate for new molecular entities (NMEs) on a five-year rolling average basis, as it quadrupled from 2015 to 2021, placing Pfizer among industry leaders. Our Phase 2 success has also helped us achieve significant improvement in our end-to-end clinical success rates. By the end of 2021, Pfizer achieved a 21% success rate for NMEs in clinical trials from first-in-human (FIH) trials to regulatory approval - a fourfold increase from 5% in 2015. This positions Pfizer with the potential to achieve one regulatory approval for every five new molecular entities entering the clinic for FIH trials. Significantly, most recent successes have been either first-in-class assets or innovations built on established mechanisms with novel scientific designs.\n\nAdditionally, from 2017 to 2021, Pfizer reduced our FIH to Approval cycle time for new molecular entities by 14% (from 9.4 years to 8.1 years). These reductions focus on operational activities\u2014including strategy development, decision-making and clinical trial recruitment\u2014where we can impact timeframes and find efficiencies. Pfizer is in line with the industry cycle time of approximately 8 years, with all planned development programs targeting less than 7 years.\n\nBy the end of 2021, Pfizer achieved a 21% success rate for NMEs in clinical trials from first-in-human (FIH) trials to regulatory approval - a fourfold increase from 5% in 2015.\n\nOur relentless focus on productivity results in greater social impact as we get more life-changing medicines into the hands of patients, and at a faster rate.\n\nThe critical importance of reducing our cycle times and increasing our clinical success rate was evident in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We delivered a breakthrough COVID-19 vaccine, achieving Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), in record time with our partner BioNTech, as well as the Pfizer treatment Paxlovid\u2122 (nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablets), which achieved FIH to EUA in less than one year.\nWe scaled our COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing efforts and processes further, successfully delivering 3 billion doses worldwide as of February 2022, broadened regulatory authorizations to include children 5 years of age and up in several countries\u2014with ongoing studies underway in younger age groups\u2014and helped vaccinated individuals maintain vaccine protection through booster doses. We will continue to follow the science and closely track emerging variants. We know there is a great need to provide vaccine access to more people quickly\u2014especially in low- and middle-income countries. More on these efforts can be found on pages 14-17.\n\nIn 2021, Pfizer\u2019s oral treatment for COVID-19, Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir and ritonavir), received authorization or approval in the U.S., Israel and other nations. Nirmatrelvir\u2014the 3CL or main protease inhibitor in Paxlovid\u2014was developed entirely in-house at Pfizer and is the first authorized oral 3CL protease inhibitor specifically designed to combat SARS-CoV-2. As an oral medication, it can be prescribed as an at-home treatment to help reduce hospitalization and deaths in patients at high-risk of developing severe illness, as well as potentially reduce the probability of infection following household exposure to COVID-19 among adults, subject to clinical success and regulatory authorization.\n\nWe have entered into multiple agreements with countries around the world, and the U.S. government has committed to purchase 20 million treatment courses of Paxlovid in 2022. In addition, as part of our comprehensive strategy to work toward equitable access to COVID-19 treatments for all people, particularly those living in the poorest parts of the world, Pfizer entered into a voluntary license agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool, a United Nations-backed public health organization. The agreement facilitates sharing of intellectual property for the production of generic versions of our oral COVID-19 treatment, with the goal of helping to improve access to COVID-19 treatments to 95 low- and middle-income countries.\n\nPfizer is very focused on applying the lessons from COVID to other programs\u2014a philosophy we call \u201clightspeed\u201d mentality. Following the successful launch of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, we took the next steps to potentially expand the application of the mRNA platform to diseases beyond COVID-19, leveraging the promise the platform holds for future breakthroughs. For example, Pfizer initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of an investigational mRNA vaccine against influenza. Beyond the flu, Pfizer plans to explore mRNA in other respiratory viruses, as well as expand to develop mRNA technology in oncology, shingles and genetic diseases.\n\nAlso within the oncology space, we are continuing development of elranatamab, an investigational bispecific molecule for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Although there are several approved therapies for myeloma, most patients will inevitably progress, and there remains a significant unmet need for innovative treatment approaches. We are advancing the development of elranatamab as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents with the goal of improving outcomes for patients with this difficult-to-treat blood cancer. In addition, through an agreement with Arvinas Inc. and the acquisition of Trillium Therapeutics Inc. in 2021, we are investing in further potential breakthrough cancer therapies. This includes ARV-471, an investigational drug for breast cancer that selectively targets the estrogen receptor for degradation, and Trillium\u2019s lead molecule, TTI-622, which targets a key immune checkpoint involved in blood cancers.\n\nAdditionally, our acquisition of Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. will allow us to advance development-stage therapeutic candidates for a range of immuno-inflammatory diseases.\n\nWe continue to advance new vaccines against pneumococcal and meningococcal diseases, and explore the impact of applying groundbreaking technologies to help fight other infectious diseases where there have been no vaccine breakthroughs to date. For example, in 2021:\n\n- Pfizer initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of its investigational respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine candidate for older adults.\n- Pfizer received FDA approval for PREVNAR 20\u2122 (Pneumococcal 20-valent Conjugate Vaccine) protecting adults against serotypes responsible for the majority of circulating pneumococcal disease.\nOur commitment to developing these breakthroughs that change patients\u2019 lives extends across our research and development (R&D) portfolio. U.S. FDA regulatory policies recognizing breakthrough innovation among new medicines offer pathways for faster review and approval. Relative to industry, Pfizer\u2019s New Molecular Entity (NME) and Biologics License Application (BLA) approvals reflect a greater proportion of breakthrough therapy and expedited regulatory designations. Between 2017-2021, 45% of Pfizer NME and novel BLA applications approved by the FDA were designated as Breakthrough Therapies compared to 30% of industry Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) vaccine applications approved over the same period. Including other FDA designations involving expedited review between 2017-2021, 91% of Pfizer NME and novel BLA applications approved by the FDA achieved one (or more) expedited designations compared to 66% of industry CDER and CBER vaccine applications.\n\nA core pillar of our ongoing product innovation work is our efforts to help slow the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) \u2013 one of the biggest threats to global health and a threat that has become even more prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic. As one of only a few large pharmaceutical companies still active in R&D of anti-infective therapies, Pfizer is continuously looking for solutions that target newly emerging infections.\n\nSlowing the spread of AMR requires a multifaceted approach across R&D, policy changes and reimbursement reforms, innovative surveillance, and an emphasis on active stewardship. Therefore, our strategy extends to innovative opportunities and unique partnerships that help improve infrastructure, education and access, enable comprehensive tracking, and expand the R&D pipeline.\n\nPfizer\u2019s recognition in the 2021 Access to Medicine AMR Benchmark reflects our industry-leading approach to combat AMR. In addition to a large portfolio of existing solutions, we are advancing a pipeline of 13 projects between pre-clinical and marketing approval stages. To complement our diverse product portfolio, our ATLAS surveillance program \u2013 one of the largest in the world \u2013 provides public access to both antifungal and antibiotic resistance data, helping researchers and stakeholders better understand resistance patterns.\n\n**Equitable Access and Pricing**\n\nPfizer\u2019s medicines and vaccines are created to help address the most challenging diseases of our time in areas of high unmet need. But those breakthroughs will not change patients\u2019 lives if patients can\u2019t access or afford them. So, in addition to driving scientific innovation, we are focused on developing transformative approaches to access, affordability and delivery, modernized for the 21st century and reflected in our pricing methods.\n\nIn 2021, an estimated 1.4 billion patients were treated or vaccinated by a Pfizer product\u00b9 (424 million patients excluding our COVID-19 vaccine and Paxlovid\u2122)\n\nFor information on access to our COVID-19 vaccine and oral treatment, see our COVID-19 Impact Story.\n\nIn 2021, an estimated 424 million patients were treated and/or vaccinated by a Pfizer product\u00b9, excluding our COVID-19 vaccine and Paxlovid. In our 2020 ESG report, we included two metrics \u2013 Patients Treated (420+ million) and Patients Reached (58+ million) through access and affordability programs. We endeavored to streamline our reporting and clarify our impact by combining these two metrics into a single KPI to show the estimated totality of patients treated with Pfizer medicines and vaccines in 2021. As a result, the 2020 number is restated to reflect the new approach resulting in 399 million patients treated in 2020. (See table for detailed breakdown by distribution channel).\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Patients Treated metric uses Pfizer and third-party datasets to estimate overall patients treated. Patients treated includes Patients Reached, which totaled the estimated number of patients globally who received a Pfizer medicine or vaccine through an alternate access or affordability program. See ESG KPI footnotes for more details.\nTo reduce the number of people who cannot afford our medicines, we are implementing:\n\n- Innovative financing mechanisms, including microfinancing, peer-to-peer lending, subscription models, flexible payment options and other innovative payment mechanisms to help reduce out-of-pocket costs for patients on a sustained basis.\n- Distribution and delivery mechanisms to simplify the drug supply chain to reduce \u201cmiddle-men\u201d and bring cost savings to patients at the pharmacy counter.\n- New technologies, such as telehealth applications that reduce barriers to care and digital wallets with the potential to pass rebates directly to patients at the point of sale, reducing out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWe set the price of our medicines and vaccines guided by the value our products bring to patients and society, achieving the broadest possible access; and with an understanding of the health systems and environment in which we operate. We partner and advocate with payers, governments and others in the health care system on behalf of patients to relieve their financial hurdles and provide access to our medicines at a cost they can afford.\n\nWe offer patient assistance and donation programs when insurance or reimbursement systems fail to provide affordable access to our medicines. And, building on our 30-year legacy of experience manufacturing biologics, our robust portfolio of biosimilars offers additional treatments at potentially lower costs.\n\nIn addition to programs for patient affordability, we also use differential pricing models, considering the differing needs of populations, to advance equitable access by striving to ensure countries and patients with the least ability to afford medicines and vaccines pay a lower price compared to those with higher incomes. Our tiered pricing strategy also works within market, where prices are determined based on the specific circumstances of a given market or region.\n\nAs part of this strategy, we engage in global commercial access partnerships with organizations like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, through which we committed to supply up to 930 million doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine by 2027 to infants and young children around the world. We\u2019ve also invested in Sayana\u00ae Press to scale capacity of contraceptive delivery from 20 million units per year to 30 million.\n\nWe aim to ensure health systems remain financially viable in situations where earlier coverage of the newest medicines is needed for optimal health. We work toward longer term solutions using flexible payment models, including risk-sharing and value-based agreements. As of April 2021, Pfizer was engaged in 10 outcomes-based agreements globally, with another six in development. Alternatively, to achieve faster and broader access to our medicines, we have over 150 financial-based agreements currently implemented or in development in emerging markets.\n\nPfizer\u2019s 2021 score in the bi-annual Access to Medicine Index jumped to No. 4, up from No. 11. Our top five positioning was driven largely by our access strategies in low- and middle-income countries, including policies for proactive access planning, capacity building and income-tailored patient solutions.\n\nHealth Care Infrastructure\n\nPfizer acknowledges that healthcare is more than the development of medicines and vaccines. Governments, civil society and the private health sector play a critical role in facilitating access to health innovations by establishing and strengthening local healthcare infrastructure.\n\nAs part of our commitment to advance health equity, The Pfizer Foundation\u2019s \u2018Accelerating Health Equity\u2019 Grant Program seeks to support efforts to reduce health disparities and improve health outcomes in Black communities in the U.S. using a social determinants of health framework.\n\nINTERNATIONAL TRACHOMA INITIATIVE (ITI)\n\nIn 1998, Pfizer and the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation co-established the ITI, a nonprofit dedicated to eliminating trachoma, the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. The ITI manages Pfizer\u2019s donated antibiotic and collaborates with governments and partners to implement the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) recommended strategy for trachoma control.\n\nOur impact\n\n- Since 1998, more than 956 million doses of Zithromax\u00ae have been donated to ITI, and more than 184 million people in 40 countries were treated.\n- A 91% decrease in the number of people at risk for blindness from trachoma between 2002 and 2021.\n- Thanks to global partners\u2019 efforts 11 countries: Cambodia, China, Iran, Ghana, Laos, Mexico, Morocco, Myanmar, Oman, Nepal, and The Gambia have eliminated trachoma as a public health problem with four other counties reporting elimination to the WHO.\n\n* As of November 2021\nLaunched in 2020, the pilot program supported 10 community-based organizations providing new health and livelihood services that address the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in Black communities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer.\n\nIn 2020, The Pfizer Foundation launched \u2018Innovation Awards in Community Health,\u2019 a new program in partnership with Direct Relief to support innovative approaches to improve infectious disease education, screening, testing, treatment, and care. Through 11 Pfizer Foundation-funded projects with U.S. safety-net community healthcare providers, more than 297,000 people in vulnerable communities across 10 U.S. states were reached through mobilization or outreach activities.2\n\nGlobal health system strengthening\n\nTo drive health access and affordability, Pfizer engages in initiatives and programs that target underserved communities and populations around the world.\n\nSince 2016, The Pfizer Foundation\u2019s Global Health Innovation Grants (GHIG) program has provided funding and technical support to health-focused entrepreneurs and social enterprises in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Initiatives address systemic challenges through training for health providers, implementation of clinics in remote areas, establishing digital health access and more. Since its launch, The Pfizer Foundation has provided $11.5 million to our partners who have helped treat 2.7 million patients, provided life-saving screening and education for 1.3 million patients, trained more than 10,000 healthcare staff and opened nearly 700 new health centers around the world.\n\nOver the past few decades, the number of people living in displacement has grown, amplifying challenges to healthcare access. The Pfizer Foundation has long partnered with organizations like the International Rescue Committee, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and others to help eliminate barriers to access and improve healthcare outcomes for refugees and other displaced populations. In 2020 and 2021, as the pandemic exacerbated health challenges around the world, we provided grants to these groups to support emergency health response efforts and the continuation of basic health services.\n\nPatient-Centric Design\n\nPfizer is more committed than ever to ensuring the perspectives of patients are not only taken into consideration, but embedded into every facet of our work to help people live longer, healthier lives. From research and development to product access, we work hand-in-hand with patients, caregivers and patient advocacy groups. Through patient education programs and resources, public policy workshops, and patient advisory boards across Pfizer\u2019s therapeutic areas, 2021 has seen continuously increasing engagement between our leadership and patient advocacy groups around the world.\n\nIn 2021, Pfizer hosted its first ever global Patients in Focus, a week-long activation on the patient perspective. Under the theme \u201cPatients are Our Why,\u201d regional leaders from across the enterprise hosted 60+ events designed to share patient and caregiver stories that build Pfizer\u2019s understanding of the needs of all patients, bring colleagues together to discuss patient-centric design, and showcase impactful patient advocacy efforts across the company. Over 38,000 colleagues and 340 patient advocacy groups participated in Patients in Focus 2021.\n\nBy way of grassroots programming and outreach, Pfizer continues to work with key groups across the U.S. to address health disparities among historically disregarded populations through its Multicultural Health Equity Collective (\u201cThe Collective\u201d formerly known as the Multicultural Center of Excellence). Building upon the trust established with partner organizations, in 2021, the Collective placed special emphasis on providing partners with culturally relevant material through educational briefing sessions, to increase confidence in COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, we started a conversation on systemic racism in healthcare to help identify solutions to disparities. The Collective continues to partner with multicultural organizations on topics that are important to them, such as access to healthcare, diversity in clinical trials, health literacy and community support programs.\n\n2 Reflects Dec. 2020-May 2021 data from the U.S. Direct Relief program\nHuman Capital\n\nPart of our commitment to remain a company of choice is being an employer of choice. We strive to create a workplace where our people feel empowered to bring their whole selves to work and realize their full potential. We focus on integrating workforce, workplace, and work output by paying special attention to the health and wellness of our colleagues; prioritizing meaningful work that contributes to our purpose of Breakthroughs that Change Patients\u2019 Lives; and fostering an environment where our people can thrive and grow.\n\nWe engage our colleagues through every phase of their experience, bringing a people-centric approach to everything from recruiting, benefits and compensation, to growth, inclusion and communication.\n\nColleague Engagement\n\nTo attract, develop and inspire the brightest talent, we aim to support our colleagues through moments that matter. We understand the importance of continuously listening and responding to colleague feedback, and our annual engagement survey, Pfizer Pulse, provides a forum for our colleagues to give structured feedback about their experience. Through this survey, we measure and track key areas of the overall colleague experience and equip leaders with actionable insights for discussion and follow up. Regular topics in the survey include employee engagement, such as colleagues\u2019 commitment to and advocacy for Pfizer; purpose, including how colleagues\u2019 work connects with our company purpose; inclusion, such as having a climate in which diverse perspectives are valued; and growth, including the ability for all colleagues to gain new experiences that align with their individual career goals.\n\nWe are proud that in 2021, on average 90% of colleagues reported feeling engaged, as measured by pride, a willingness to recommend Pfizer as a great place to work, and intent to stay. In addition, 92% agreed their daily work contributes to our purpose.\n\nColleague DEI\n\nEquity is a core value at Pfizer where every person deserves to be seen, heard, and cared for. In 2021, Pfizer made several advances in our approach to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI): we announced a New Chief Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Officer, Ramcess Jean-Louis; our annual Global DEI Summit focused on allyship and the science behind inclusion; and we launched our refreshed Global DEI Strategy and Governance Structure.\n\nOur refreshed Global DEI Strategy and Governance Structure aims to further embed DEI into our workplace and our purpose through defined enterprise priorities and expectations, new roles and accountabilities, and outcomes tracking. The strategy was co-designed with our Enterprise Colleague Resource Groups (ECRGs) and cross-functional stakeholders across our business. It is built upon three pillars:\n\n- Building a more inclusive colleague experience through representation and meaningful connections.\n- Advancing equitable health outcomes by evaluating our work through the lens of the communities we serve.\n- Transforming society with external DEI partnerships, including deploying capital, engaging diverse suppliers and amplifying equity initiatives.\n\nWith such a broad scope, leaders are responsible for various priorities under each pillar and teams are responsible for driving 35 key initiatives. Each priority has clear outcome metrics\u2014a total of 16\u2014aligned to removing barriers to access and improving diverse representation for colleagues and partners. These metrics are agreed upon by our DEI Board prior to executing initiatives. It is critical that DEI is embedded in everything that we do.\nColleague resource groups\n\nIn 2021, we established an ECRG Council to enable regular sharing of best practices across our seven ECRGs\u2014Global Asian Alliance, Global Black Community, Disability, Pfizer Women\u2019s Resource Group, Out Pfizer Employee Network (OPEN), Pfizer Latino Community and Veterans in Pfizer, which act as the parent organizations for our local site Colleague Resource Group (CRG) chapters. Our more than 100 global CRG chapters offer support, developmental opportunities, mentoring and networking opportunities to help members enhance their skills and advance their careers, while fostering community. Despite the pandemic, our CRGs continued to host virtual events with external experts and internal leaders to discuss equity, allyship, clinical trial diversity, and intersectionality with the intention to build bridges across demographics.\n\nOur CRGs contribute to a more diverse and inclusive environment through colleague discussions such as newly created Safe Space Listening Sessions in response to current events, and by helping to fuel our pipeline of diverse talent. In 2021, 72% of summer interns surveyed identified as representing an underrepresented group or disadvantaged background, far exceeding our goal of 50%. Within this class of students, 13 placements came directly from CRG referrals and another 48 resulted from our partnership with INROADS, a non-profit that seeks to develop and place talented under-served young people in business and industry.\n\nPartnerships\n\nWe hire, grow, and empower diverse talent by partnering with external organizations that provide rich engagement opportunities with people of diverse backgrounds and experiences. In 2021, this included joining Tent\u2019s Coalition for Afghan Refugees, signing a commitment to help drive lasting change for the 1.3 billion people living with a disability around the world, and participating in McKinsey\u2019s Black Leadership Academy Management Accelerator.\n\nOur efforts and partnerships earned Pfizer industry recognition. We received 100% on the Human Rights Foundation Corporate Equality Index and Disability:IN Equality Index, and earned a 5-star rating in procurement and governance by the Hispanic Association on Corporate Responsibility. Additionally, Pfizer ranked #1 within the Drug & Biotech industry on Forbes\u2019 \u201cBest Employers for Women\u201d list and #21 overall on Forbes\u2019 \u201cBest Employers for Diversity\u201d list. Notably, we jumped 174 spots on the Financial Times annual Diversity Leaders list to #38.\n\nPay equity\n\nOur commitment to pay equity for all colleagues is based in our value of Equity and our intention to continue to build a diverse and inclusive workforce. In 2021, Pfizer announced, both internally and externally, the findings of a recognized compensation expert, which confirmed equitable pay practices at Pfizer for employees based on role, education, experience, performance and location. In terms of base pay, Pfizer pays our female colleagues globally at greater than 99% (99.4%) of what we pay male colleagues. When looking at minority versus non-minority pay in the U.S., minorities are at dollar-for-dollar parity (100%) with the pay of non-minorities. The study covered 71,100 colleagues globally, including our Executive Leadership Team (ELT).\n\nFor the first time in 2021, Pfizer released median pay gaps for women globally and minorities in the U.S., measuring the distribution of pay among colleagues without accounting for any factors. As of the start of 2022, Pfizer\u2019s pay equity study demonstrated the median pay for women globally was 102.3% of the median pay of men, and the median pay for minorities in the U.S. was 85.5% of the median pay for non-minorities.\n\nIn the UK, Pfizer has seen significant year-over-year progress in closing the median gender pay gap \u2014 the difference in average hourly pay for men and women across our organization. In 2021, the median gender pay gap decreased 2.7 percentage points to 7.5%. This fourth consecutive year-over-year reduction is driven by our UK five-point Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strategy. Introduced in 2019, it follows a test, learn and adapt approach and enables us to measure success and target action where it\u2019s most needed.\n\nIn 2021, Pfizer\u2019s efforts with pay equity secured an \u2018A\u2019 grade on the Arjuna Capital/Proxy Impact Racial and Gender Pay Equity Scorecard. We intend to continue to measure pay equity on an annual basis and to publicly release results.\n\n---\n\n1 The analysis is based on the pay period in which the snapshot date of April 5, 2021 sits. These metrics represent our combined Pfizer UK figures. Under the U.K. Gender Pay Gap regulations, we are required to report our gender pay gap data for each separate legal entity that has at least 250 employees and therefore we have reported data for Pfizer Limited and Pfizer R&D UK Limited. A full copy of the report can be found at: https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/\nColleague Growth and Development\n\nWe are committed to helping our colleagues reach their full potential by rewarding both their performance and leadership skills, and by providing opportunities for growth and development. In 2021, we began redefining our growth strategy at Pfizer to promote non-linear development for all colleagues, set a transparent talent framework followed by all managers, and cultivated a sustainable pipeline of leaders through internal mobility. Championing personalized career journeys, Pfizer implemented a common language around growth \u2014along with a guiding framework\u2014to help colleagues identify the best growth experiences to unleash their full potential and deliver breakthroughs. The rollout also included various colleague tools and resources to encourage growth conversations and offer transparency on the sources of growth available to all colleagues.\n\nChampioning personalized career journeys, Pfizer implemented a common language around growth \u2014along with a guiding framework\u2014to help colleagues identify the best growth experience to unleash their full potential and deliver breakthroughs.\n\nIn addition to fostering an environment where all colleagues have an equitable opportunity to grow, we are committed to scientific talent development through various learning programs designed to give participants exposure to different scientific functions across Worldwide Research, Development and Medical (WRDM). Objectives include increased scientific and business acumen through broad exposure to WRDM:\n\n- Build and expand networks to promote cross-line knowledge-sharing and professional development.\n- Energize and engage critical WRDM talent in the broader objectives of the organization.\n- Provide insights into potential internal alternate career paths.\n- Provide WRDM line leadership with exposure to top talent throughout the organization.\n- Implementation of a targeted EHS Risk Reduction program with external API suppliers to drive closure of EHS observations identified through onsite audits.\n- Development and launch of a new Biological Risk Assessment tool to increase hazard awareness.\n\nReplication of such initiatives is a key mechanism in accelerating positive change to help colleagues and collaborators remain engaged and productive.\n\nHealth, Safety, and Wellbeing\n\nAt Pfizer, protecting the health, safety and well-being of colleagues and contingent workers, all of whom are essential to delivering our business objectives, is an integral part of how we operate. Our Global Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) Policy and supporting standards outline our approach to assessment, evaluation, elimination, and mitigation of EHS risks across our operations globally. In addition, they facilitate colleague engagement in EHS thereby enabling continuous improvement.\n\nEach Pfizer colleague and contingent worker plays a crucial role in facilitating a culture of EHS excellence where improvements, ideas, suggestions, and opportunities are welcomed. Fostering this culture of interdependence with everyone looking out for each other enables Pfizer to meet its commitment to our patients.\n\nThrough our annual EHS recognition program we recognize and celebrate actions taken by colleagues to implement or replicate innovative solutions that achieve measurable improvements in attaining an injury-free Pfizer. Examples of health and safety initiatives recognized in the past year include:\n\n- Implementation of an EHS auditor qualification program to increase line colleague engagement in EHS performance review at one of our manufacturing sites.\n- Increasing effectiveness of response to hazard observations by empowering Safety Representatives to drive mitigation actions to completion at another manufacturing site.\n- Provided 15 educational webinars and information sessions on mental health and wellbeing, nutrition, and work-life balance through our employee assistance program (EAP) provider; included monthly wellness tips in the twice-monthly HR newsletter and distributed videos developed by internal experts to educate colleagues on vaccinations and combat vaccine hesitancy.\n\nOur Pandemic Response\n\nDuring 2021, pandemic preparedness and response continued to be a key focus to help ensure on-site workers at our commercial, manufacturing and research sites remained safe and healthy while continuing to support work from home arrangements for colleagues who can work remotely. A task force of senior leaders continues to oversee implementation of the company pandemic preparedness plan, setting expectations for precautions required at Pfizer sites including social distancing, face masks and sanitation. These precautions have been instrumental in protecting our workforce and helping ensure a continued supply of medicines and vaccines to patients. During 2021, we:\n\n- Implemented a vaccination program for colleagues and their families in the U.S. and 23 other countries where employer vaccination programs were possible. Over 150,000 doses have been administered as of the end of 2021.\n- Partnered with Thrive Global, a wellness and organizational change initiative with a primary focus on colleague mental health and wellness.\n- Provided 15 educational webinars and information sessions on mental health and wellbeing, nutrition, and work-life balance through our employee assistance program (EAP) provider; included monthly wellness tips in the twice-monthly HR newsletter and distributed videos developed by internal experts to educate colleagues on vaccinations and combat vaccine hesitancy.\nWe behave ethically and thoughtfully in everything that we do, owning our responsibility to change lives for the better. As part of this responsibility, Pfizer prioritizes safety, quality and transparency in our operations. Our governance structure supports proactive business-led quality and compliance built around elements of effective risk management. To facilitate accountability, our Board of Directors is more involved than ever in the governance and oversight of our ESG strategy, as outlined in the following sections.\n\n**Ethics, Transparency, and Quality**\n- Ethical Decision Making\n- Laws and Regulations Compliance\n- Open Door Culture and Investigations\n- Transparency\n- Safety and Quality\n- Counterfeit Medicines\n- Supply Chain Transparency\n- Intellectual Property\n- Clinical Trials\n- Data Privacy and Protection\n- Right To Health\n- Political Contributions and Lobbying Activities\n\n**Accountability**\n- Right Incentives\n- Board Of Directors and Board Committees\n- Board Leadership Structure\n- Governance of ESG\n- Board Diversity and Independence\n\n**How our approach to governance issues supports the SDGs**\n\n**Good Health and Well-Being**\nWe aspire to ensure health and well-being for all at all ages through equitable access to medicines and vaccines.\n\n**Gender Equality**\nWe aim to end discrimination against women, ensure equal opportunities for leadership and access to reproductive health.\n\n**Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions**\nWe operate to uphold justice, promote the rule of law, and develop ethical, transparent, and representative decision-making.\n\nMore information on the SDGs [here](#).\nGovernance\n\nEthics, Transparency, Quality\n\nAt Pfizer, we have established values and clear expectations regarding how we achieve our purpose. We are committed to living our values and to acting with integrity. Our values help guide us in making decisions ethically, thoughtfully and responsibly, to help support our business to appropriately meet patient and societal needs.\n\nThe Regulatory and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors oversees our quality and compliance governance framework, including the business-led Quality & Compliance Committees across our core functions, which drive proactive risk management and accountability. This Committee\u2019s oversight of healthcare quality and compliance includes business ethics, responsible product marketing, and compliance with anti-bribery / anti-corruption, transparency, product promotion and other applicable laws and regulations, in pursuit of advancing integrity and Pfizer\u2019s purpose. Our leaders set the tone for our strong culture of acting with integrity in all we do and support a speak-up culture in which colleagues can raise concerns without fear of retaliation. Our patient-centric purpose and established culture of quality and safety are of paramount importance during this extraordinary time in history as we innovate and continue to deliver breakthroughs.\n\nEthical Decision Making\n\nValues-based decision making promotes accountability and helps ensure that integrity, quality, safety and ethics are foundational to all we do. Our Code of Conduct (The Blue Book) and related policies, procedures and training are designed to support these values, including courage, excellence, equity and joy. Policies governing colleague interactions with healthcare organizations, physicians, patients and other stakeholders are contained in the White Guide for U.S. headquarters-based colleagues and the Orange Guide for U.S. field-based colleagues. Pfizer also maintains a Global Policy on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. We incorporate ethics and business integrity into internal performance evaluations, which are designed to enhance colleague accountability, including leadership performance with integrity.\n\nLaws and Regulations Compliance\n\nPfizer\u2019s ethics and compliance expectations represent a shared undertaking on the part of all colleagues. Pfizer is committed to conducting business responsibly, and acting ethically and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. We expect the same commitment to acting ethically and with integrity from suppliers, as well as from consultants, agents, representatives and other companies and individuals acting on our behalf, as well as those acting on their behalf (e.g., subcontractors), in connection with work for Pfizer.\n\nPfizer is proud to be named one of the World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing standards for ethical business practices. Pfizer\u2019s purpose-driven work and strong culture of ethics, integrity, sustainability, governance and community were critical to this recognition.\n\nPfizer\u2019s compliance organization is led by our Chief Quality, Compliance & Risk Officer who reports directly to the CEO and is a member of the Executive Leadership Team, which is designed to ensure access to cross-functional leadership and sufficient resourcing. Pfizer\u2019s ethics and compliance program is overseen by a dedicated Regulatory and Compliance Committee of the Board, which helps support impartiality and independence of the program. We regularly engage independent third parties to assess our ethics and compliance program against standards established by governments, rating agencies and industry best practices. In 2021, we conducted two independent compliance program reviews to assess program effectiveness and seek opportunities for continuous learning and enhancement. Our internal audit function has a systematic and regular audit process, and works with key stakeholders across the company to conduct our Enterprise Risk Management process that assesses on an annual basis our operations and risk management priorities, including, among others, those related to quality, compliance and ethical standards, responsible marketing, and anti-bribery / anti-corruption.\nOur quality and compliance governance framework is driven by a global, cross-functional approach built around the elements of effective compliance and risk management, including, for example:\n\n- **Culture**: leaders are committed to and accountable for fostering a culture consistent with our values, and we incorporate ethics and business integrity into performance management frameworks\n\n- **Policies**: clear, easy-to-understand policies and procedures provide guidance, including our principles-based Code of Conduct and our whistleblower policy to protect colleagues who raise concerns, outlined in our Code of Conduct. Our international anti-bribery and anti-corruption policies and procedures are designed to ensure full compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and applicable international anti-bribery laws. Pfizer policy prohibits all forms of bribery and corruption, whether by colleagues or our business partners. Colleagues and business partners must never offer, promise, authorize, or provide a payment or benefit that is intended to improperly influence a government official, healthcare professional, or any other person, including commercial entities and individuals, in exercising their responsibilities\n\n- **Training**: colleagues and certain third parties receive risk-based, role-specific training on our Code of Conduct and other key areas, including ethical standards, responsible marketing and advertising practices, and anti-bribery / anti-corruption training, upon hire and regularly thereafter (normally every one to two years), to reinforce our policies and commitment to integrity. Our ethics and compliance training programs use multi-modal components to address different learning styles, maximize engagement, and reinforce training content. Our training program encompasses role-based scope of topics and depth of knowledge to drive training effectiveness\n\n- **Communications**: messaging about ethics and integrity, including communications from leadership, culture campaigns, and creative use of various media, reinforces our focus on always doing things the right way and speaking up with any questions or concerns\n\n- **Risk Assessment**: enterprise-level and tailored ethics and compliance risk assessments, including in the area of anti-bribery / anti-corruption, conducted regularly throughout the year (on a market-by-market basis) and feeding into our annual Enterprise Risk Management process, are aimed at identifying and mitigating potential risks\n\n- **Monitoring**: live, continuous monitoring across key risk areas is designed to detect and remediate any potential non-compliance and seek opportunities for enhancement of our ethics and compliance program\n\n- **Third Party Compliance**: robust controls and processes are designed to evaluate and mitigate risk related to third parties we work with, including a formal global anti-bribery / anti-corruption diligence process that includes screening, auditing, training, confirmation of policies (including bribery/corruption prohibitions) and monitoring of third-party agents and intermediaries, and other risk-based compliance controls designed to ensure ethical business practices and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including anti-bribery / anti-corruption laws\n\nQuality and compliance committees for each of our core functional areas, as well as our Executive Compliance Committee (the highest-level internal compliance oversight body, composed of Pfizer\u2019s executive leadership and chaired by the CEO) provide an innovative framework to advance business-led proactive risk management and drive clear accountabilities for leaders and colleagues to act with integrity in all that they do. The remit of the Executive Compliance Committee includes oversight of healthcare quality and compliance, business ethics, responsible product marketing, and compliance with anti-bribery / anti-corruption, transparency, product promotion and other applicable laws and regulations.\n\n**Open Door Culture and Investigations**\n\nLeaders and management are dedicated to fostering a culture in which all colleagues can ask questions, raise concerns and report potential misconduct without fear of retaliation. We measure colleague comfort and awareness about raising concerns, including awareness of our whistleblower policy, through an anonymous culture survey sent to all colleagues annually. The results are used to focus our leadership communications, training and other proactive efforts to drive our ethical culture.\n\nMany channels exist for raising questions and reporting concerns, including the Compliance Helpline (third-party public hotline available by phone or web, with anonymous reporting where allowed under local law), the Compliance Division (through email, phone, fax and colleagues), management, and our Open Door Policy (whistleblower policy), which encourages colleagues to present ideas, ask questions and raise concerns. Retaliation against anyone who seeks advice, raises a concern, reports misconduct or provides information in an investigation is strictly prohibited by our policy that protects whistleblowers. In addition, our Office of the Ombuds is a resource to support colleagues with information and guidance to help them resolve work-related issues.\n\nPfizer takes reports of known or suspected violations of company policies and applicable law seriously; our goal is to respond promptly to all questions and reported concerns. We aim to identify and address any potential inappropriate conduct as early as possible, prevent future recurrences, and inform continuous improvement.\n\nWe investigate all referable compliance issues (RCIs)\u2014significant potential, suspected or actual violations of law or policy. For RCIs where there is a substantiated violation, we institute individual discipline where appropriate, including measures such as coaching, warnings, and termination. Our compliance investigations process also includes analysis of the root cause of substantiated RCIs. After investigation, we work with accountable stakeholders to implement corrective and preventive actions. Pfizer has a process to escalate certain significant matters to the Executive Compliance Committee, the Regulatory and Compliance Committee and the Audit Committee of the Board.\nGovernance\n\n\u2014 Continued\n\nTransparency\n\nPfizer is committed to the principle of transparency, disclosing our efforts that relate to issues of public interest. We uphold high ethical, scientific and medical standards in all our research and development activities and are committed to disclosing financial and other interests and relationships that may create apparent or perceived conflicts of interest. These include areas such as funding for educational activities, the status of our U.S. pharmaceutical post-marketing commitments, our pipeline of experimental medicines, the registration and reporting of results of clinical trials, corporate political contributions in the U.S., federal and state lobbying activities, and disclosures of medical grants.\n\nPfizer also reports to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) payments and other transfers of value made to U.S.-licensed physicians and U.S. teaching hospitals. In 2021, our commitment to transparency also included:\n\n- Adhering: Adheres to the \"plain language results summary\" initiative intended to make our clinical trial results and descriptions more understandable and accessible to a general audience;\n- Posting: Posts all Pfizer clinical trial results to the U.S. National Library of Medicine's clinicaltrials.gov website accessible to the public;\n- Sharing: Share our positions on issues important to Pfizer and our industry; please see Report on Incongruencies;\n- Communicating: Communicates more transparently around product quality and safety standards and KPI progress.\n\nOur efforts to combat COVID-19, including those to provide equitable and affordable access to COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics for all, also demonstrates our continued commitment to transparency.\n\n- We maintained a dedicated COVID-19 information site on Pfizer.com to directly provide the public with ongoing COVID-19 news and information, including how Pfizer is responding to new variants.\n\nSafety and Quality\n\nAt Pfizer, the highest priority is placed on the safety of our patients and the quality of our products. Our culture of integrity and accountability aims to ensure that each and every dose \u2013 of the billions we supply each year \u2013 is manufactured to the highest standards. Our safety and quality policies and processes reinforce our colleagues\u2019 shared commitment to developing, manufacturing and supplying safe and effective vaccines and therapeutic medicines to patients around the world.\n\nA Foundation of safety & quality: A well-established quality management framework\n\nPfizer\u2019s Quality Management System (QMS) is designed to ensure compliance with all applicable quality and safety regulations, codes and standards, and provides a framework and common foundation when engaging in any activity that can directly or indirectly affect the health and well-being of patients, including: the research and development of products; clinical trial design and execution; regulatory submissions; the manufacturing, packaging, and supply of products; pharmacovigilance, and post-market surveillance; and commercial and medical affairs activities. Our QMS is continuously monitored to help ensure it remains a pathway for the appropriate identification of quality, safety and compliance issues and risks.\n\nMOVING AT THE SPEED OF SCIENCE: MAKING THE IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBLE\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic began, the challenge wasn\u2019t just developing a vaccine, we also had to make and supply it, by the billions, to the waiting world without compromising product quality or patient safety. We did this by moving at the speed of science, working within our established QMS, and adhering to our strong foundation of safety and quality policies and processes. We continue to place the utmost emphasis of patient safety and product quality at every step in the clinical development and manufacturing process and through our safety monitoring.\n\nUntil the very end of last year, no mRNA vaccine had ever been authorized and thus, one had never been manufactured at scale by any company. Pfizer invested more than $2 billion at risk on our COVID-19 vaccine development program \u2013 with $500 million of that spent on scaling up our manufacturing capabilities, before we knew the results of our clinical trials. There were no guarantees. But, with over 170 years of experience on our side, we\u2019ve arguably developed the most efficient vaccine manufacturing machine that the pharmaceutical industry has seen. In order to manufacture more than 3 billion doses (as of December 31, 2021), we have had to plan every detail with a laser focus on quality and safety, and the journey is far from over. We know there is a dire need to vaccinate more people quickly. That\u2019s why we\u2019re continuing to expand and enhance our manufacturing capabilities and processes. We believe that the impossible can be possible \u2013 because we witnessed it firsthand.\n\nFor more information on Clinical Trials see pages 46 and 32 and access the Clinical Trials information on our corporate website.\n\nFor more information on Medicine Safety, access the Medicine Safety information on our corporate website.\n\nView our Corporate Quality Policy.\nIdentifying and mitigating risks\nRisk management is a key element of our QMS. This risk management includes appropriate escalation of issues and risk tracking and mitigation plans to the Quality & Compliance Committees, the Executive Compliance Committee and the Regulatory & Compliance Committee of the Board. Whether a product is developed, manufactured and supplied by Pfizer or a third party, any significant quality or regulatory compliance issues are investigated in a timely manner and addressed with corrective and preventative actions. Procedures are in place to ensure issue escalation as appropriate and is commensurate with the level of risk involved.\n\nPfizer\u2019s global policies, processes and training procedures\nOur comprehensive global policies and procedures are designed to ensure compliance with our scientific, ethical, legal and regulatory obligations, and our own high standards. We also expect the same from third parties who carry out work on behalf of Pfizer.\n\nAs an example, Pfizer has more than 140 standards that apply to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)-related activities. These standards set out the criteria for our own Pfizer-wide GMP quality management system, which is based on a number of industry-recognized quality management principles.\n\nWe know the importance of continuous education and training. As such, individuals who perform work for, or on behalf of, Pfizer have the necessary education, training, skills, qualifications, and experience to carry out work in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and Pfizer\u2019s own stringent standards.\n\nRequired training is based on role and responsibility, and role-specific quality and compliance training is added to colleagues\u2019 core curriculum.\n\nDemonstrating quality through internal and external audits\nAs part of our Independent Audit program, we regularly assess the design and operating effectiveness of the Pfizer QMS using a risk-based approach that adheres to regulatory and internal quality requirements. The audit program spans preclinical, clinical, pharmacovigilance, regulatory, medical and manufacturing activities, third parties and suppliers. Our approach to audits is aimed to help ensure we proactively identify potential areas of improvement, enabling us to effectively manage risk while maintaining and improving our performance for patients.\n\nMeeting Pfizer\u2019s high quality and safety standards: Third-party management\nGiven the high number of third parties with whom Pfizer works, we have strict controls in place to manage risks that originate from or are related to third parties conducting work on Pfizer\u2019s behalf. Our comprehensive due diligence, selection and qualification process for all Contract Research Organizations (CROs), vendors, third-party manufacturers and suppliers is designed to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations and Pfizer policies. This process also extends to our risk management oversight program for all third parties. Quality agreements that outline the requirements to maintain continued qualified status are in place for all vendors of materials used in Pfizer\u2019s drug product manufacture. Additionally, materials used by third-party manufacturers must be approved for use.\n\nBreakthroughs made possible through our commitment to quality, safety and integrity in clinical trials\nBefore a medicine is approved and available, it is tested in clinical trials. Pfizer\u2019s QMS includes a focus on managing clinical trial activities to protect participants and the reliability of results. The QMS is designed to oversee quality, ensure consistency in the execution of processes, support the management of risks to quality throughout all stages of clinical development, and promote a strong and healthy culture of quality and knowledge management. We put participants\u2019 rights, safety and well-being first, always.\n\nPRODUCING OUR PRODUCTS TO THE HIGHEST QUALITY STANDARD\nU.S. FDA and other Health Authorities around the world conducted a total of 63 inspections of Pfizer facilities in 2021 related to good manufacturing practice (GMP), confirming each inspected site was in a state of compliance. Our supply network is designed to ensure we produce medicines and vaccines to the highest quality and safety standards, in full compliance with Pfizer\u2019s Global Quality Standards and GMP based on global requirements and industry best practices. Each of our internal manufacturing, supply and distribution operations holds relevant manufacturing licenses and GMP certificates.\n\nAs of the end of calendar year 2021, two Pfizer manufacturing sites remained classified as Official Action Indicated by FDA. One of these sites has since been reclassified as Voluntary Action Indicated (VAI) due to our successful implementation of corrective and preventive actions.\n\nFor more information, please see U.S. FDA Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) Regulations.\n\nICH Q10 Pharmaceutical Quality System model.\n\nFor more information on our approach to Supply Chains see pages 27, 46.\n\nPlease visit the U.S. Food & Drug Administrations (FDA) MedWatch website for more information on product safety alerts.\n\nVisit the U.S. Food & Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) Postmarket Drug Safety Information for Patients and Providers for up-to-date information on product use.\n\nFor more information on Medicine Safety, access the Medicine Safety information on our corporate website.\n\nFor more information on Global Pharmacovigilance, please refer to World Health Organization Regulation and Prequalification.\n\nFor more information on our approach to Clinical Trials, see page 47 and access the Clinical Trials information on our corporate website.\nSupplying high-quality breakthroughs that change patients\u2019 lives\n\nOur integrated, innovative and highly specialized global supply network delivers medicines to patients in more than 165 countries \u2013 more than 20 billion doses in just one year. Our 39 internal manufacturing facilities, along with our external manufacturing and supply partners, and tens of thousands of Pfizer Global Supply colleagues, all operate within our QMS. We have a Quality team at each of our global manufacturing sites and distribution centers, and a dedicated Quality team that provides oversight to our external suppliers.\n\nCommitment to patient safety\n\nOne of our primary responsibilities as a global pharmaceutical company is to ensure the safety of the patients taking our products. Pfizer\u2019s commitment to product safety begins in the lab and continues for as long as the medicine is available to patients.\n\nPfizer\u2019s extensive safety system is realized by thousands of Pfizer\u2019s experts who work in partnership with healthcare providers and regulatory authorities to analyze, and communicate the risks and benefits of our medicines both before and after they are approved for use.\n\nAfter approval, we continuously review and assess the product\u2019s safety profile to ensure the benefits outweigh the risks associated with its use. Global pharmacovigilance activities are centralized in our Worldwide Safety organization and led by our Chief Safety Officer. Our safety database is constantly monitored for emerging safety trends and assessed by healthcare professionals and other experts to determine actions that ensure the safe and effective use of our products. Our Worldwide Medical & Safety processes are designed to meet compliance with global health authority requirements.\n\n| Safety and Quality KPIs | 2021 |\n|-------------------------|------|\n| # Internal Audits across GCP/PV/GMP | 102 |\n| # Third Party audits across GCP/PV/GMP | 922 |\n| # GCP/GMP/PV FDA Inspections | 19 |\n| # GCP/GMP/PV Inspections from All Other Health Authorities | 120 |\n| # Unique Health Authorities Completing Inspections | 59 |\n| # FDA inspections of Pfizer facilities that resulted in an enforcement action | 0 |\n| # GMP facilities in VAI Status | 17 |\n| # GMP facilities in OAI Status | 2 |\n| # GCP Inspections of Pfizer facilities resulting in VAI Status | 0 |\n| # GCP Inspections of Pfizer facilities resulting in OAI Status | 0 |\n| # PV Inspections of Pfizer\u2019s PV system resulting in VAI Status | 0 |\n| # PV Inspections of Pfizer\u2019s PV system resulting in OAI Status | 0 |\n| # FDA Recalls | 4 |\n| % of batches distributed with no recalls (US Market) | 98.4% |\n| # Class I Recalls | 1 |\n| # Class II Recalls | 3 |\n| # Class III Recalls | 0 |\n\nGCP: Good Clinical Practices\nGMP: Good Manufacturing Practices\nPV: Pharmacovigilance\nVAI: Voluntary Action Indicated\nOAI: Official Action Indicated\n\n1 Count of inspections includes all GCP/GMP/PV inspections performed at a Pfizer facility, as well as inspections performed at an investigator site or CRO related to a Pfizer clinical study.\n2 Data includes both regulatory warning letters as well as enforcement actions (e.g., seizure, injunction, criminal prosecution and/or criminal fines).\n3 In January 2022, one of these facilities was reclassified as Voluntary Action Indicated (VAI). 96% of our GMP facilities that supply the U.S. market are VAI or NAI status.\nA 170 year history of high quality and safe products\n\nPeople depend on us for their health. When a medical need arises, the breadth and depth of our company enables us to rapidly adjust our processes, while maintaining our high standards, and re-allocate resources to quickly produce potential life-saving therapies, all while continuing to safely manufacture and supply hundreds of products to patients. Every dose of the medicines we produce must be made to the highest standards, always ensuring product quality and patient safety.\n\nCounterfeit Medicines\n\nCounterfeit medicines pose a significant risk to patient health and safety. To protect our patients, we take a proactive approach to product safety by investing in an enterprise-wide, global strategy to combat counterfeit threats through patient education, surveillance and interdiction, public-private collaboration, and legislative advocacy. Pfizer provides training to healthcare professionals who interact directly with patients, and law enforcement to better identify counterfeit drugs. Our anti-counterfeiting webpage aims to raise awareness among patients about the dangers of fake medicines. Additionally, we work with those involved in every step of the supply chain to monitor distribution channels and improve surveillance of distributors and repackagers.\n\nPfizer addresses the issue of illicit online prescription drug offers through effective internet monitoring and disruption programs, which search and systematically disrupt online pharmacy and social media groups dispensing counterfeit versions of Pfizer medicines and vaccines. Our anti-counterfeiting program is augmented by innovations such as artificial intelligence and natural language processing to keep pace with rapidly evolving digital threats. If a counterfeit product is identified in the legitimate supply chain, a formal process is in place to alert all impacted parties.\n\nPfizer invests in packaging and information technologies to align with global mandates around serialization. The unique Product Identifiers developed for serialization will enable the tracking and tracing of product movement through the supply chain, from the manufacturing site to patient dispensation (including Government Systems and Trading Partners) and allows authorized trading partners today to verify the authenticity of our medicines with a simple scan.\n\nSupply Chain Transparency\n\nWe are committed to maintaining stringent quality standards through our extensive supply networks \u2013 both internal and external. We\u2019ve prioritized building out our governance processes that oversee the manufacturing and supply quality of everything we produce. We see compliance with regulatory standards as the foundation of risk mitigation and a crucial component of providing the world with a reliable supply of safe and effective medicines and vaccines.\n\nWe also assess our suppliers\u2019 environmental, health and safety (EHS) performance, including labor and ethics, by performing audits and reviewing environmental sustainability data.\n\nOur current Modern Slavery Statement outlines our approach to the management of modern slavery risks in our supply chain. Pfizer is currently focusing on targeted high-risk areas as identified by the Global Slavery Index and is taking steps to address these risks as described in our Statement, including implementation of our corporate labor and ethics standard. If we identify these higher risk areas, our process outlines additional due diligence processes to be implemented to help avoid being complicit in supporting modern slavery.\n\nIn addition to championing responsible supply chain EHS performance internally, Pfizer contributes to pharmaceutical industry efforts to improve performance in supply chain EHS management. We pursue opportunities to help suppliers achieve better performance by:\n\n- Verifying through audits that our suppliers operate in compliance with laws and in alignment with Pfizer\u2019s Supplier Conduct Principles and the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) Principles for Responsible Supply Chain Management.\n- Coaching to increase capability, drive impact reduction and sustain EHS improvement.\n\nThrough a combination of remote and on-site audits we assessed EHS performance for 122 supplier facilities in 2021, resulting in 925 observations. Of the suppliers audited, 5 were identified as not meeting Pfizer\u2019s expectations for EHS performance, resulting in Pfizer not pursuing business with those suppliers. We have worked with the others to establish action plans to mitigate risks and continue to monitor implementation progress.\n\n\\[1\\] In this context, \u201cinterdiction\u201d refers to the seizure, raids and arrests to prevent counterfeits from reaching its targeted audience.\nGovernance\n\n\u2014 Continued\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nThe incentives provided by the intellectual property system are fundamental to our ability to apply science and invest the resources necessary to deliver breakthroughs that change patients\u2019 lives. As reflected in the \u201cIP Principles for Advancing Cures and Therapies\u201d (IP PACT), Pfizer is committed to patient and societal benefit as guiding principles in our IP practice.\n\nWe recognize the unique socioeconomic challenges facing Least Developed Countries and have a policy of patent non-enforcement in those countries. Pfizer has entered into a voluntary licensing agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP), a United Nations-backed public health organization, to share intellectual property related to our oral COVID-19 treatment, with the goal of helping to improve access to COVID-19 treatments to 95 low- and middle-income countries and enable supply to a slate of countries that account for 53% of the world\u2019s population. We also have an agreement with the MPP to help facilitate the clinical development of sutezolid, an investigational medicine for the treatment of tuberculosis.\n\nWe believe that accessible patent information promotes scientific progress and helps improve the procurement of medicines; in line with this belief, we are a member of the Patent Information Initiative for Medicines (Pat-INFORMED), an initiative hosted by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) that facilitates easy access to medicine patent information.\n\nPfizer is a founding member of WIPO Re:Search, a public-private partnership administered by WIPO that aims to catalyze a broad range of innovative collaborations to support early stage research and development in the fight against neglected tropical diseases. We are also a sponsor of the Inventor Assistance Program, a WIPO initiative in cooperation with the World Economic Forum that matches developing country inventors and small businesses of limited financial means with patent attorneys that provide pro bono legal assistance to secure patent protection.\n\nWe believe that the more people who can turn great ideas into reality through the patent system, the greater the chance of creating a thriving society that allows countries to develop economically.\n\nClinical Trials\n\nEvery successful clinical trial is built on trust. Pfizer honors that trust by conducting representative and transparent trials by sharing the policies that govern our global clinical research, and providing plain language result summaries for certain trials. Through the plain language summaries, we intend to make our clinical trials more understandable and accessible to the general audience. These policies and study result reporting mechanisms help ensure that every clinical trial is planned, conducted and reviewed according to our high ethical, clinical, and scientific standards.\n\nAs we work to develop new medicines and vaccines for the patients we serve, our conduct is guided with the help and oversight of a variety of groups. These groups include patient groups, institutional review boards, regulatory authorities, data and safety monitoring boards, medical and industry association guidelines governing ethical clinical trial conduct and research integrity, and our own bioethics advisory panel.\n\nAll Pfizer-sponsored interventional studies are conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as principles derived from relevant international standards, including:\n\n- The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) International Ethical Guidelines.\n- The International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) E6 guideline for Good Clinical Practice.\n- PhRMA\u2019s Principles on Conduct of Clinical Trials and Communication of Clinical Trial Results.\n- The Declaration of Helsinki.\n- The United States Belmont report.\n- More information on Pfizer policies related to clinical trials can be found on our research integrity and transparency page at Pfizer.com.\n\nDIVERSITY IN CLINICAL TRIALS\n\nWe recognize the importance of diversity in clinical research when it comes to creating equitable health outcomes. We recently conducted a 10-year retrospective analysis of diversity in our U.S. clinical trials to better understand how to meet patient needs. This analysis helped reinforce our commitment to diversity in clinical trials, as we firmly believe clinical trials should reflect the racial and ethnic demographics of the countries and communities in which they are conducted. For example, in the U.S., we\u2019ve made a commitment to achieving racially and ethnically diverse participation at or above U.S. census or disease prevalence levels (as appropriate) in all of our trials. Pfizer is proud of our transparency efforts on diversity in our clinical trials and of the decisive steps we are taking to help ensure representation in clinical trials around the world.\nData Privacy and Protection\n\nPfizer is committed to the responsible and transparent use and protection of personal data entrusted to us by patients, customers, employees and others. We provide our employees and contractors with training on global privacy principles in accordance with our commitment to respect and safeguard personal data. Our privacy practices are governed by our Global Privacy Committee, a cross-functional governance body composed of senior-level leaders who provide oversight and guidance that informs company practices. Additionally, our Global Privacy Office maintains an enterprise-wide policy and standards that guide the collection, maintenance and protection of personal data and consider the legal and regulatory requirements where we do business.\n\nExamples of the practices we follow to help ensure the integrity of our data privacy processes include:\n\n- Collecting and using the minimum amount of personal data necessary to achieve our business purposes.\n- Sharing personal data only with individuals who have a legitimate need for it and will protect it.\n- Maintaining appropriate administrative, technical and organizational security measures to protect personal data.\n- Training our employees on the responsible use of personal information.\n\nRight to Health\n\nPfizer's purpose fuels everything we do and reflects both our passion for science and our commitment to patients.\n\nThroughout 2021, Pfizer continued to build on our multi-year review of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and what they mean for our company and how to progress a human rights-based approach to our work.\n\nBased on Pfizer's human rights policy statement, we focused on the right to health as our number one priority, with availability, accessibility and affordability as key focus areas. This priority has been particularly critical for Pfizer the last two years, as the pandemic has exacerbated human rights inequities. We knew the right to health of underserved populations, those in hard-to-reach locations, and places lacking access to basic health services would be most severely impacted by the pandemic.\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, our paramount concern has been equitable and affordable access to COVID-19 vaccines for all people around the world. We continued to evaluate regularly the risks COVID-19 poses to people and adapted our response while engaging with stakeholders.\n\nWe have mapped our human rights responsibilities against our sustainability priorities, and in the coming year and beyond, will continue refining our human rights work to more fully integrate considerations around people risks into our business strategy, decision-making, operations and partnerships. We will continue to build relationships, engage with our key stakeholders, and leverage our work collaboratively with peers and other partners to fulfill our responsibility to respect human rights.\nGovernance\n\n\u2014 Continued\n\nPfizer is a member of various industry and trade groups that represent both the pharmaceutical industry and the business community at large to bring about consensus on broad policy. In addition to trade group positions on health care policy issues, we realize these organizations may engage in a broad range of other issues that extend beyond the scope of what is of primary importance to Pfizer\u2019s business. If concerns arise about a particular issue, we convey our concerns, as appropriate. We believe there is value in making sure our positions on issues important to patients, Pfizer, and our industry are communicated and understood within those organizations. In December, Pfizer issued a report outlining the public policy positions of Pfizer and five trade associations across six areas of key public policy and ESG significance for Pfizer. The report also compares Pfizer and the trade associations\u2019 positions and describes the degree of alignment and areas of misalignment.\n\nPfizer\u2019s corporate political contributions and lobbying activities are focused on promoting the interests of the patients we serve and our company, without regard to the personal political preferences or affiliations of any of our employees, officers, or board members. The company\u2019s corporate political contributions and lobbying activities are subject to robust internal procedures designed to align these efforts with our public policy priorities and applicable law. The company has an extensive training and reporting program in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as Pfizer\u2019s internal policies and procedures.\n\nPfizer opposed the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and paused Pfizer Political Action Committee (PAC) giving to the 147 Republicans who voted against certifying the election for the first half of 2021. Pfizer also supports ensuring every American citizen\u2019s right to vote, which is fundamental to preserving democracy.\n\nAccountability\n\nRight Incentives\n\nPfizer is committed to long-term sustainability focused on fulfilling our purpose, responsibly. We hold our leadership accountable for our societal and environmental impact, and have implemented a top-down ESG strategy. In 2021, the Compensation Committee reviewed methods for linking compensation with ESG performance. Effective for the 2022 performance year, the Committee adopted the ESG Scorecard, (similar to the research and development modifier approach) which will be used as a tool to assist in determining the funding for the annual short-term incentive plan (GPP program). This change to our compensation program will impact over 30,000 colleagues and leaders, globally.\n\nThe ESG Scorecard approach will further solidify our commitment to the ESG initiatives. We believe the metrics used in the ESG Scorecard are some of the key drivers for our future success. The specific ESG metrics being used for the GPP are Percentage of Vice President and higher roles held by women (globally), Percentage of Vice President and higher roles held by minorities (U.S.) and Greenhouse Gas Emissions.\n\nWe\u2019re purposefully taking a holistic approach to determine what success looks like, and how our executives are rewarded for performance. We\u2019re proud of the Compensation Committee\u2019s decision to incentivize sustainability and positive social impact, contributing to our role as a responsible corporate citizen.\n\nFor additional details on the GPP Program, refer to the Pfizer 2022 Proxy Statement.\nBoard of Directors and Board Committees\n\nThe Board of Directors is elected annually by the shareholders. The primary responsibility of the Board is to represent shareholders and to enhance long-term shareholder value. The Board elects the chief executive officer and other members of the senior management team, and acts as an advisor and counselor to senior management and ultimately monitors its performance. The function of the Board to monitor the performance of senior management is facilitated by the presence of a majority of independent non-employee Directors who have substantive knowledge of the Company\u2019s business.\n\nPfizer\u2019s Board Committees are integral to the overall functioning of the Board. The Board has six committees:\n\n- Audit Committee\n- Compensation Committee\n- Executive Committee\n- Governance & Sustainability Committee\n- Regulatory and Compliance Committee\n- Science and Technology Committee\n\nGovernance of ESG\n\nGood governance over ESG for Pfizer starts with the Board and extends throughout every level of the enterprise. These past two years have shown us the importance of listening to all stakeholders, learning from our experiences, and stepping up to lead when society needs us to. This commitment precedes the COVID-19 pandemic and has long been part of our DNA as a company.\n\nThe Governance & Sustainability Committee (G&SC) of the Board is primarily responsible for oversight of our ESG strategy, reporting, policies and practices. The Committee is also responsible for considering risks relating to:\n\n- The company\u2019s lobbying and political activities; and\n- The company\u2019s policies and practices related to its human capital management, which may include culture, diversity, equity and inclusion, pay equity and talent management.\n\nThe G&SC receives periodic updates from management on Pfizer\u2019s progress against ESG goals and future initiatives designed to further enhance performance. Other Board Committees oversee elements of our ESG program associated with their respective areas of responsibility. For example:\n\n- The Audit Committee, which has primary responsibility for overseeing Pfizer\u2019s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program, reviews and receives briefings concerning risks to Pfizer associated with certain priority issues (e.g., information security and technology, cybersecurity, drug pricing, access and reimbursement), including ESG areas. ERM provides a framework for risk identification and management which includes risks associated with ESG factors. The Audit Committee is also monitoring and assessing Pfizer\u2019s preparedness for potential mandatory sustainability reporting under consideration by the SEC.\n\n- The Compensation Committee collaborates with the G&SC on responsibilities delegated by the Board related to human capital management and recently approved incorporating three ESG metrics into the annual short-term incentive plan funding for 2022, which will impact all 30,000 plus participants in this plan. In addition, ESG factors, including the three used in the short-term annual incentive plan, are included in the individual performance goals of many executives throughout the organization, which will further align their compensation with ESG factors.\n\n- The Regulatory and Compliance Committee (RCC) has oversight of quality and compliance risk management in the areas of healthcare compliance across Pfizer\u2019s core functions \u2013 Research & Development and Medical, Manufacturing and Supply, and Commercial \u2013 in support of Pfizer\u2019s focus on quality, safety, transparency, and integrity in pursuit of scientific advancement, public health and its purpose.\nGovernance\n\n\u2014 Continued\n\nThe Board of Directors is fully engaged and supportive of Pfizer\u2019s ESG program. This year, Chair of the G&SC, Joseph Echevarria, held a fireside chat with Pfizer\u2019s Chief Compliance, Quality & Risk Officer, broadcast publicly, to describe how the Board addresses ESG issues across multiple committees, and how our approach to ESG is integrated with the ERM program.\n\nIn addition, ESG is managed internally by our cross-functional Sustainability Steering Committee, which advises on key issues and guides the integration and implementation of Pfizer\u2019s non-financial reporting related to ESG. The Committee is co-chaired by our Chief Sustainability Officer and ESG Head, and sponsored by the Executive Leadership Team member leading Corporate Affairs, who reports directly to the Chairman and CEO.\n\nWe encourage all colleagues to contribute to achieving our ESG goals by understanding our strategy and to apply an ESG lens to their day-to-day activities. In October 2021, we held an enterprise-wide event to raise colleague awareness about our purpose. This event served as a call to action to convert that purpose into ESG impact by advancing our corporate ESG strategy.\n\nBoard Diversity and Independence\n\nOur Board is composed entirely of independent directors other than our chairman and CEO, Albert Bourla, and is diverse, with diversity reflecting gender, age, race, ethnicity, background, professional experience and perspectives. Each Director provides a unique perspective, experience and skill set, that creates an effective and well-functioning Board.\n\nTo help ensure effective refreshment and proactively manage eventual vacancies on the Board, the Governance & Sustainability Committee and the full Board consider a diverse pool of qualified director candidates on an ongoing basis. This process resulted in the election of six new independent directors over the past five years, bringing our average Board tenure to six years.\n\n| Board Composition |\n|-------------------|\n| **Board Tenure** |\n| 10+ Years | 2 |\n| 6 to 10 Years | 3 |\n| 0 to 5 Years | 7 |\n| **Average Tenure** | 6 years |\n\n| Board Diversity |\n|-----------------|\n| Female | 4 of 12 Directors |\n| Ethnically Diverse | 3 of 12 Directors |\n\n| Key Skills and Experience |\n|---------------------------|\n| Business Leadership and Operations | 9 |\n| International Business | 6 |\n| Medicine and Science | 6 |\n| Healthcare and Pharma | 6 |\n| Finance and Accounting | 6 |\n| Risk Management | 4 |\n| Academia | 4 |\n| Human Capital Management | 4 |\n| Government and Public Policy | 3 |\n| Technology | 3 |\n\nShareholders and other interested parties may communicate with any of our directors, including the lead independent director and the audit committee chair, as follows:\n\nBy email: [https://investors.pfizer.com/Investors/Corporate-Governance/Contact-Our-Directors/default.aspx](https://investors.pfizer.com/Investors/Corporate-Governance/Contact-Our-Directors/default.aspx)\n\nBy mail: Corporate Secretary, Pfizer Inc., 235 East 42nd Street, New York, New York 10017\nMeasuring and reporting our environmental, social and governance performance is key to understanding the impact of our operations, driving continuous improvement, and maintaining a transparent dialogue with our stakeholders.\n\nWe are committed to improving our ESG performance because it is crucial to our long-term success as a responsible business and is essential to achieving our purpose. The key performance indicators we track are driven by an assessment of issues of greatest relevance and impact to our external stakeholders and our business.\n## Environment\n\n| Climate change (Scopes 1 & 2)\\(^1,2,3\\) | 2019 (baseline) | 2020 | 2021 | 2030 Goal |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------|------|------|-----------|\n| Carbon emissions (in thousand metric tons CO2e)\\(^4\\) | 1,264 | 1,182 | 1,172 | 680 |\n| Renewable electricity (%) | 9.4 | 4.9 | 6.5 | 100% |\n\n| Supply chain environmental sustainability (Scope 3)\\(^3\\) | 2019 (baseline) | 2020 | 2021 | 2025 Goal |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------|------|-----------|\n| Suppliers of purchased goods and services by spend with science-based targets (%)\\(^5\\) | | | 10% | 64% |\n| Business travel carbon emissions (in thousand metric tons CO2e)\\(^6\\) | 351.5 | 96.3 | 29.0 | 263.6 |\n| Upstream transportation & distribution carbon emissions (in thousand metric tons CO2e)\\(^7\\) | | | | 672.6 |\n\n---\n\n1.

Biosimilars and generics are excluded from all analyses, as are product enhancements (supplemental indications, major new formulations, etc.). New molecular entities (NME) are the foundation of Pfizer\u2019s, and industry\u2019s, innovative medicines pipelines. NMEs originating outside of Pfizer and acquired or licensed by Pfizer after achieving FIH or more advanced development milestones are generally excluded from FIH-approval cycle time calculations where substantial development effort occurred before Pfizer\u2019s operational control. Cycle times from FIH to approval are calculated between the FIH date for the NME in its first indication pursued, and first major regulatory approval (U.S. FDA or EU European Medicines Agency) approval for the NME. The NME approval may or may not be for the same indication by which the NME triggered its first FIH milestone. Rolling cohorts are used to provide sufficient sample sizes to calculate cycle times between major development milestones.\n\n2. The FIH to approval NME success rate metric is a composite metric. It is a cumulative success rate derived using individual phase success rates from FIH (start of Phase 1) to approval (first regulatory approval) at an NME level. Combinations of approved NMEs, biosimilars and generics are excluded from all success rate calculations. Cumulative NME success rate is calculated using three-year rolling cohorts for Phase 1 and five-year rolling cohorts for Phase 2, Phase 3 and registration.\n\n3. Included on Pfizer\u2019s Product Listing:\n   - U.S. Products Only: The product listing shows products available to U.S. consumers only.\n   - New Drug Application (NDA): Products included are only shown (or removed) if it has an active NDA (or the NDA has been withdrawn). This results in certain products being listed that are no longer available to the general public or are not actively marketed.\n   - Biosimilars, dosages, etc.: A product in the listing may be made up of biosimilars, Product Enhancements (PEs), or different dosages. A count of the products shown in the listing would not represent the total number of products (understating the total).\n   - Co-Marketing Agreements: Products that were co-marketed with other companies are included in the products listing. However, the third party may be taking or be responsible for a significant portion of the underlying marketing.\n\n4. The 2021 figure is as of February 8, 2022 and represents the number of R&D programs in Phase 1 to registration, including programs for additional uses and dosage forms for in-line and in-registration products.

Breakthrough and other expedited U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory designations are cited as a proxy measure of innovation among Pfizer and biopharmaceutical industry novel drug approvals. As with success rate and time-to-market metrics, the metrics exclude biosimilars, generics and product enhancements. Our criteria for FDA expedited designations includes breakthrough therapy, fast track, priority review and accelerated approval. These four designations are well-defined and established in FDA reporting and suitable for tracking over time. The metrics cover a rolling 5-year period and references Pfizer internal medicines portfolio data and data provided by the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). The scope of these metrics is limited to new molecular entities (NME), novel biologics license applications (BLA) and novel vaccine approvals. Pfizer novel drug approval counts include co-developed or acquired assets which may not be listed as distinctly Pfizer assets among FDA data. Industry novel drug approval counts exclude Pfizer approvals.\n## Social\n\n\u2014 Continued\n\n### Innovation and Global Health\n\n| Description of actions and initiatives to promote access | 2020 ESG Report \u2013 Social Narrative | pg. 34 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------|\n| Patients treated\\(^1\\)                                  | 399 million                       |       |\n| Access to Medicine Index (ATMI) Ranking\\(^2\\)           | 4th                               | 4th   |\n| Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Benchmark Position\\(^3\\) | 69% / 2nd                         | 81% / Joint Leader |\n| Percent change in average net price for U.S. portfolio\\(^4\\) | 1%                                | -5%   |\n\n### Patient-centric design\n\n| Position in Global PatientView Survey\\(^5\\) | 4th | 2nd |\n\n---\n\n1.

We have been working for over two decades to address this global challenge through three generations of greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals and other resource conservation efforts. We are committed to developing and implementing a science-based climate action strategy and in December 2020 announced our ambition to become carbon neutral by 2030. In addition, as outlined in our Climate Change Position Statement, we aim to conduct robust risk assessments to safeguard resiliency of our research, manufacturing, and commercial activities and to transparently report on our progress, risks, and opportunities aligned with Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) recommendations.\n\nGovernance\n\nPfizer climate change program is co-led by senior colleagues in the Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) and Legal functions and is integrated into Pfizer\u2019s operational and risk management processes as described below.\n\nRisk & Operational Governance:\n\nThe Governance & Sustainability Committee (G&SC) of the Board of Directors provides oversight of Pfizer\u2019s Environment, Social, Governance (ESG) strategy and reporting and corporate citizenship matters. The Committee, composed solely of independent directors, is responsible for oversight of our ESG strategy, reporting, policies and practices. The Committee is also responsible for considering risks relating to the company\u2019s lobbying and political activities; and the company\u2019s policies and practices related to its human capital management, which may include culture, diversity and inclusion, pay equity and talent management. The G&SC receives periodic updates from management on Pfizer\u2019s progress against ESG goals and future initiatives designed to further enhance performance.\n\nPfizer\u2019s Global Supply (PGS) Quality & Compliance Committee (PGS QCC) reports key risks, including those related to climate change, to the Executive Compliance Committee of Pfizer\u2019s Executive Leadership Team, including the CEO, and to the Regulatory and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors. The PGS QCC risk management process also informs Pfizer\u2019s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program.\n\nPfizer\u2019s ERM program provides a framework for risk identification and management of significant risks, including risks related to climate change and the long-term sustainability of the business. Each risk is assigned to a member or members, as appropriate, of our Executive Leadership Team. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed solely of independent directors, has primary responsibility for overseeing Pfizer\u2019s ERM program. Periodically, the Regulatory and Compliance Committee and the Audit Committee hold joint sessions to discuss risks relevant to both committees\u2019 areas of risk oversight, including an annual discussion of the ERM program. The board is kept informed of its committees\u2019 risk oversight and other activities through reports by the committee chairs to the full board.\n\nMore information on the risk assessment process for climate change is provided in the risk assessment section below.\n\nManufacturing at our internal network of sites, managed by PGS, accounts for over 70% of the company\u2019s energy consumption and GHG emissions. The Executive Vice President (EVP), Chief Global Supply Officer leads Pfizer\u2019s manufacturing and supply chain and serves as the executive sponsor of climate change risk management and has operational control over PGS operations and strategy, including operating expenses (OPEX) and capital expense (CAPEX) investment in emission reduction projects.\n\nEnvironmental sustainability has been integrated into Pfizer\u2019s business strategy and GHG emissions reduction is monitored as a key performance indicator.\n\nESG Governance:\n\nPfizer\u2019s Sustainability Steering Committee, co-chaired by the Chief Sustainability Officer and ESG Lead, provides formal oversight and an accountability mechanism for ESG (including climate-related) risks and opportunities and is responsible for ESG strategy implementation. The Sustainability Steering Committee reports on priorities and progress to the Board of Director\u2019s Governance & Sustainability Committee (G&SC) which provides oversight of the Company\u2019s environmental, social and governance strategy and reporting, and corporate citizenship matters.\n\nRisk Assessment\n\nPfizer assesses climate change risk as part of our Enterprise Level EHS & Business Continuity Risk Management Process. Under this process, we conduct Operational Risk Evaluations (OREs) which are structured evaluations of risks with the potential to have substantive impact to Pfizer. The process determines the effectiveness of controls in place to manage or mitigate risk.\n\nClimate change risk is evaluated by a team that includes relevant program leaders and subject matter experts from EHS and Business Resilience, Engineering, Compliance, Legal, and Audit. The Climate Change ORE is designed to assess potential risk to Pfizer across four risk factors, including: External/Reputational, Physical, Regulatory/Legal, and Market & Technology Risks. Individual risks across each of the four risk factors are evaluated and rated based on severity, vulnerability, and risk to Pfizer with the goal to ensure that sufficient controls are in place to effectively mitigate climate change risks and prevent material impact to Pfizer.\nUsing the ORE, we assess risk factors based on severity and vulnerability as measured by effectiveness of management controls. We define high severity as loss of the capability to produce products as the result of extensive damage, shut-down, or substantial loss of operations. We define high vulnerability as weak management controls that are not as robust as would be reasonably expected across multiple layers, suggesting increased potential for significant failure of risk control. The higher the severity and the vulnerability, the higher we define overall risk. Based on the risk scores, we prioritize action. Of the TCFD categories of climate risks, we have determined the most significant potential threat to our operations is physical risk.\n\nPfizer uses tools such as Swiss Re CatNet to monitor short-, medium- and long-term physical threats to internal operations and for more than 5,000 contract manufacturers and material suppliers. Risks identified through these assessments are reviewed as part of the ORE, and mitigation of risk is monitored through Pfizer\u2019s Business Resilience program and escalated to company leadership as needed to inform business strategy.\n\nAcute and chronic physical risks related to climate change are managed through Pfizer\u2019s Insurance and Business Continuity teams at the enterprise and local levels. Members from those teams participate in the risk review process that addresses business continuity/resiliency and provide input on the potential impact of physical risks that may be related to climate change, including severe weather events and flooding.\n\nReputational risks are managed through our process to transparently disclose information related to our climate action program and engage with key stakeholders to help lead the conversation on voluntary actions companies can take to address their GHG emissions.\n\nRegulatory risks are managed through regulatory development tracking and analysis enabled by our Legal and Global EHS teams.\n\nMarket and technology risks are monitored and managed through our Global EHS & Business Continuity risk management process.\n\nPfizer\u2019s integration of climate change into divisional and enterprise risk management processes includes reviewing risks that could be material to the company to support SEC 10-K reporting.\n\nRisks and opportunities identified through our assessment process are summarized in the table below. Refer to our 2021 CDP Response for additional detail on how climate-related risks have impacted our business, strategy and financial planning.\n## Transition Risks and Opportunities\n\n| Risk or opportunity | Potential impact | How managed |\n|---------------------|------------------|-------------|\n| Increases in operating costs due to introduction of carbon pricing/taxation schemes (short and medium term) | Carbon pricing has emerged as a key policy mechanism to reduce GHG emissions and curb the impacts of climate change. The number of jurisdictions with carbon pricing policies is increasing, with over 60 carbon pricing initiatives in place or planned by regulators as of 2021. The World Bank\u2019s \u201cHigh-Level Commission on Carbon Pricing and Competitiveness\u201d report suggests that a carbon price of $50 - $100 / tCO2e will be required to achieve RCP 2.6 by 2030. Although not financially substantive to our operations at this time, carbon pricing could potentially impact Pfizer\u2019s global operations. Of the countries that have not implemented carbon taxes/pricing, the United States (US) represents the area of greatest potential impact to Pfizer. Operations in the US represent approximately two-thirds of Pfizer\u2019s scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. If the US implements a federal carbon pricing scheme aligned with World Bank recommendations, the cost to Pfizer could range from approximately $28 million to $73 million annually by 2030 based on current scope 1 and 2 emissions. | To mitigate the impact of carbon fees, including increases in the cost of goods within our supply chain, Pfizer continues to focus on energy demand reduction through our internal and supply chain GHG emission reduction goals (recognized through the Science Based Targets initiative). |\n| Failure to meet stakeholder expectations | Pfizer is seeing an increase in requests for environmental performance data and GHG emissions reduction commitments from customers and investors. For example, England\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) (which purchases Pfizer medicines and vaccines) has publicly declared its intention to stop purchasing from suppliers that do not meet or exceed the NHS commitment to net zero by 2030. Pfizer\u2019s commitment to ambitious climate action may help us to retain or increase revenue by meeting these demands. Alternatively, failure to meet current climate commitments and/or to continue taking ambitious climate action could result in the loss of market share, shareholder investments, or otherwise negatively impact Pfizer\u2019s reputation. | Pfizer has committed to ambitious targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative as aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C trajectory. We are committed to becoming carbon neutral across internal operations by 2030 by reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions 46 percent from a 2019 baseline, purchasing 100 percent electricity from renewable sources, and addressing any remaining emissions through carbon credits. Recognizing that Pfizer\u2019s value chain emissions account for approximately 80% of our carbon footprint, we are using our influence to catalyze action from our suppliers. We have integrated environmental criteria across our supplier sourcing, contracting, and performance management processes and are asking our suppliers to set science-based GHG emission reduction goals by 2025. We are also using scientific innovation to reduce the environmental impact of our medicines. We are currently working to define environmental sustainability criteria across the product life cycle and plan to establish public sustainable medicine targets in 2022. |\n| Reductions in operating costs resulting from efficiency improvements (short and medium term) | As a global company, Pfizer operates in multiple jurisdictions with current, pending, or potential future carbon tax and carbon cap and trade schemes. Fuel and energy costs have the potential to increase in these regions. By implementing energy conservation projects, Pfizer can reduce exposure to increasing energy costs. We currently achieve annual savings of approximately $3-5 million through the implementation of emission reduction projects. These projects typically have a payback period of 4-10 years or less and have a lifetime greater than 6 years. | Pfizer\u2019s Environmental Sustainability and Impact Reduction Standard requires all sites to develop a systematic approach to conserve energy and improve efficiency. Sites identified as medium and large energy users are required to establish environmental sustainability teams and to develop and maintain sustainability master plans that include prioritized emission reduction opportunities. Project implementation is monitored at the corporate level with performance reports provided to company leadership quarterly. Pfizer invests an estimated $25-40 million each year to reduce energy demand through asset replacement, efficiency improvements, and installation of renewable technologies. |\n### Transition Risks and Opportunities - continued\n\n| Risk or opportunity                                                                 | Potential impact                                                                                                                                                                                                 | How managed                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Increased need for medicines that treat climate-related diseases (medium and long term) and increased revenues through demand from new and emerging markets as disease patterns shift (short term) | As global average temperatures and the frequency of extreme weather events increase there will likely be an increase and/or geographical shift in the need for medicines, vaccines, and associated research and development. | As a biopharmaceutical company we are uniquely positioned to help address the global health challenge that is the result of climate change. We evaluate our current product portfolio against diseases that are exacerbated by climate change to identify medicines and vaccines potentially responsive to this global health challenge, such as treatments for various vector and waterborne diseases. With an extensive portfolio and expansive geographic reach, we have been able to consistently meet the diverse needs of, and provide significant value and impact to, patients and health care professionals around the world in an innovative, socially responsible and commercially viable manner. |\n\n### Physical Risk\n\n| Risk or opportunity                                                                 | Potential impact                                                                                                                                                                                                 | How managed                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reduced revenue and potential impact on the supply of medicines and vaccines resulting from disruption caused by climate-related severe weather events (short, medium and long term) | Climate change presents risks to our operations and those of our suppliers, including the potential for property damage, business interruption, and/or loss of stored product as a result of more frequent and severe weather events and water availability challenges. The potential loss that could reasonably be expected is challenging to quantify and predict given the number of variables but could range from $20 million to $400 million based on facility and product values. | Pfizer has implemented business continuity programs to ensure our physical operations and supply chains are taking steps to mitigate the risk and potential impact of interruption. We have completed an assessment of physical risk for all our manufacturing facilities and for over 5,000 of our suppliers using climate modeling scenarios predicting temperature increases ranging from 0.2\u00b0C to 3\u00b0C. For our internal manufacturing sites, the output of this analysis supports decisions related to business continuity and recovery planning at the sites. Pfizer\u2019s Loss Prevention and Business Continuity programs identify potential supply chain vulnerabilities and establish contingency plans to maintain supply, e.g., alternative sourcing options and holding multiple weeks of buffer inventory (depending on product). Pfizer maintains resources for assessing and establishing business continuity arrangements such as the activation of alternative supply chains. Supply chain and business continuity professionals are retained as staff and consultants to ensure these plans are updated at least annually, exercised at least annually, and key colleagues on site are trained on their content and implementation. |\nMetrics & Targets\n\nPfizer calculates Scope 1 and 2 emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol (revised edition). Our 2020 GHG footprint (including Scope 3 categories 1-8 and 15) was independently assured pursuant to ISAE 3000 (revised) by ERM CVS and verification of 2021 data is underway. Emissions are reported annually in our CDP response and are broken down by type, country and business division. We also track metrics relative to our business continuity and disaster recovery programs (e.g., number of supplier assessments completed; sites with fully implemented plans for the management of risk associated with natural perils such as flooding and severe weather, noting it is not possible to state with certainty whether individual weather events are a result of climate change).\n\nPfizer discloses our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions annually through our CDP submittal and publishes our Scope 1+2 emissions in our ESG Report (formerly in our Annual Review) and on our website.\n\nWe have achieved three consecutive GHG reduction goals (2000-2007, 2007-2012, and 2012-2020) and have reduced our GHG emissions over 60% since 2000. We remain committed to ambitious long-term actions and have announced our ambition to become carbon neutral across our internal operations, procuring 100% renewable electricity and delivering a 46% absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions from a 2019 baseline. Any remaining emissions will be offset through carbon credits. Additionally, recognizing that Scope 3 emissions account for 80% of our carbon footprint, we also commit to reducing emissions related to upstream logistics by 10% and business travel by 25% by 2025 from a 2019 baseline, and to use our influence to catalyze similar reductions across our value chain.\nAbout This Report\n\nThis ESG Report details our performance on Environmental, Social and Governance topics and contains non-financial disclosures covering the period of January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021, unless otherwise stated. Our financial disclosures can be found in the 2021 Annual Review and our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We will continue to report our ESG performance on an annual basis as a supplement to our Annual Review.\n\nThis report covers all of Pfizer\u2019s global operations included within the 2021 financial statements, unless otherwise stated. Our priority assessment has validated issues that traditionally have been viewed as meaningful to our business and our external stakeholders.\n\nIn addition, we intend to continually evaluate our performance reporting and enhance our related data collection processes and controls. Some of our disclosures in this report are estimates or based on assumptions, due to the inherent measurement uncertainties. As an example, because of patient privacy laws, data constraints and contractual obligations, we have used shipping data, financial performance and third-party reports to determine patient counts in support of our KPI measuring the number of patients treated. Although we believe such estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results will vary.\n\nExcept as indicated on this page, the information in this report has not been audited, verified or attested to by any third party. We have obtained limited assurance verification by ERM-CVS of certain greenhouse gas emissions data that we submit to CDP.\n\nThis report has been reviewed by our head of Corporate Affairs, our Chairman and CEO, members of our cross-functional Sustainability Steering Committee, and the Governance & Sustainability Committee of our Board of Directors.\n\nGlobal Reporting Frameworks\n\nThis report\u2019s content is grounded in our ESG priority assessment and has been informed by several globally recognized external frameworks. These include the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD). We relied to some extent on each framework to develop this report while formally adhering to none in their entirety.\n\nPfizer also considers elements of other ESG indices and sustainability indicators \u2013 in particular, the Access to Medicine Index (ATMI) and the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (also known as the Global Goals). As a signatory to the UN Global Compact, we submit an annual communication to the UN on our progress made toward achieving the Global Goals.\n\nManagement Assertion\n\nPfizer has allocated $710 million in net proceeds from the issuance of its March 25, 2020 Sustainability Bond as of December 31, 2021, to the eligible projects identified on page 22 of this report in accordance with the Use of Proceeds defined on pages S-6 and S-7 of the Prospectus Supplement dated March 25, 2020, and allocated $1 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of its August 22, 2020 Sustainability Bond as of December 31, 2021, to the eligible projects identified on page 18 of this report in accordance with the Use of Proceeds defined on pages S-6 and S-7 of the Prospectus Supplement dated August 16, 2021.

Pfizer\u2019s management is responsible for its assertion. Our responsibility is to express an opinion that the Allocations were performed in accordance with the Use of Proceeds defined within the Prospectus Supplements based on our examination.\n\nOur examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management\u2019s assertion is fairly stated, in all material respects. An examination involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about management\u2019s assertion. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of management\u2019s assertion, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nOur examination was not conducted for the purpose of evaluating Pfizer\u2019s 2021 Environmental, Social & Governance Report or any of the metrics contained herein. Thus, we did not audit or opine on the sufficiency, completeness, appropriateness or accuracy of the reporting criteria or methodology of such metrics. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance other than on whether the Allocations were performed in accordance with the Use of Proceeds set forth in the Prospectus Supplements.\n\nIn our opinion, management\u2019s assertion that the Allocations were performed in accordance with the Use of Proceeds set forth in the Prospectus Supplements, is fairly stated in all material respects.\n\nNew York, New York\nMarch 17, 2022\n\nKPMG LLP\n", "source": "pfizer_2021", "added": "2025-04-27", "created": "2025-04-27", "metadata": {"Source-File": "climate_reports/tp_reports/pfizer_2021.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.1.59", "pdf-total-pages": 83, "total-input-tokens": 185327, "total-output-tokens": 51591, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 1149, 2], [1149, 1700, 3], [1700, 6028, 4], [6028, 7549, 5], [7549, 12305, 6], [12305, 12929, 7], [12929, 15270, 8], [15270, 16323, 9], [16323, 17282, 10], [17282, 19495, 11], [19495, 22684, 12], [22684, 24446, 13], [24446, 25044, 14], [25044, 28454, 15], [28454, 31480, 16], [31480, 32717, 17], [32717, 37478, 18], [37478, 41612, 19], [41612, 45532, 20], [45532, 48950, 21], [48950, 51988, 22], [51988, 55639, 23], [55639, 58716, 24], [58716, 59870, 25], [59870, 62767, 26], [62767, 66103, 27], [66103, 67239, 28], [67239, 70026, 29], [70026, 72121, 30], [72121, 74218, 31], [74218, 78188, 32], [78188, 82711, 33], [82711, 86866, 34], [86866, 91592, 35], [91592, 95918, 36], [95918, 99497, 37], [99497, 104419, 38], [104419, 109972, 39], [109972, 111590, 40], [111590, 115849, 41], [115849, 122161, 42], [122161, 127309, 43], [127309, 132983, 44], [132983, 136357, 45], [136357, 141113, 46], [141113, 146076, 47], [146076, 148998, 48], [148998, 152516, 49], [152516, 156141, 50], [156141, 159197, 51], [159197, 159747, 52], [159747, 162946, 53], [162946, 164293, 54], [164293, 167483, 55], [167483, 169248, 56], [169248, 172356, 57], [172356, 174463, 58], [174463, 176256, 59], [176256, 176880, 60], [176880, 178733, 61], [178733, 179041, 62], [179041, 180989, 63], [180989, 183123, 64], [183123, 185287, 65], [185287, 187977, 66], [187977, 191112, 67], [191112, 192970, 68], [192970, 194548, 69], [194548, 196476, 70], [196476, 201643, 71], [201643, 203202, 72], [203202, 206381, 73], [206381, 208954, 74], [208954, 215054, 75], [215054, 220755, 76], [220755, 223302, 77], [223302, 228089, 78], [228089, 233150, 79], [233150, 234924, 80], [234924, 242765, 81], [242765, 245375, 82], [245375, 245375, 83]]}}
