We know that there is much work to do, and Wells Fargo is well-positioned to make a difference.\n\n\u2014 Charles W. Scharf\nCEO, Wells Fargo & Company\nWells Fargo\u2019s key ESG themes & focus areas\n\nAs a leading financial services company, Wells Fargo believes that it has a role to play in addressing social, economic, and environmental sustainability, and the company is committed to sound and effective corporate governance practices. The company continues to take an active role in addressing pressing societal challenges to drive positive impact.\n\nWells Fargo regularly assesses ESG and sustainability themes and focus areas that it believes are most relevant to the company and its stakeholders. The company monitors ESG trends, and has periodically engaged with stakeholders to identify top-of-mind ESG themes, which inform its strategies, goals, and reporting priorities. With those topics in mind, Wells Fargo continues to work to make meaningful progress with respect to these pressing ESG challenges.\nWells Fargo focuses its work on three sustainability-related areas of critical importance.\n\n**Environmental sustainability**\nWells Fargo believes that climate change is one of the most urgent environmental and social issues of our time. That is why in March 2021, Wells Fargo announced its effort to support the transition to a low-carbon economy by setting a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In 2021, the bank also joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, an industry leadership group focused on implementing climate targets. In furtherance of this net-zero goal, in May 2022, the company published the [Wells Fargo CO2eMission](#), a climate alignment and target-setting methodology for its financing portfolios, and set its first interim financed emissions targets for two high-emitting sectors (Oil & Gas and Power). In 2021, the company also launched an Institute for Sustainable Finance to deploy $500 billion of financing to sustainable businesses and projects by 2030, as well as to support science-based research on low-carbon solutions, and advocate for policies that enable client transitions.\n\n**Social impact**\nWells Fargo seeks to support a more sustainable and equitable economy by opening pathways to economic advancement, championing quality affordable homes, empowering small business growth, and enabling a low-carbon economy. Through these and other efforts, the company hopes to help build wealth, enhance economic mobility, and strengthen diverse and historically marginalized communities. In collaboration with community organizations, civic leaders, and nonprofits at the local, state, and national levels, Wells Fargo is working to address systemic barriers to financial inclusion and opportunity. Wells Fargo\u2019s resources and expertise can make a positive impact in communities, addressing these complex societal issues to help build a more sustainable, equitable future for all.\n\n**Diversity, equity, and inclusion**\nWells Fargo is dedicated to diversity, equity, and inclusion. The company is focused on increasing diverse representation at all levels, creating a more inclusive workplace, and better serving and growing its diverse customer segments and diverse suppliers across all lines of business. This approach is embedded in the company\u2019s culture and business practices, products and services, and philanthropic giving. Additional details are discussed in the [2022 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Report](#).\n\nAs Wells Fargo continues its work on key ESG themes, the company recognizes that its employees, culture, and governance are all critical ingredients for making meaningful progress.\nEnvironmental\nEnvironmental sustainability\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s focus on environmental sustainability is about working toward an equitable and sustainable future and to support the transition to a low-carbon economy. In March 2021, Wells Fargo announced its efforts to support the transition to a low-carbon economy by setting a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 including its financed emissions \u2014 by 2050.\n\nIn addition to Wells Fargo\u2019s net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 goal, the company committed to deploying its resources and working closely with customers. To drive its execution efforts, Wells Fargo established an enterprise-wide climate initiative to promote leadership connectivity and accountability. In addition, Wells Fargo\u2019s Independent Risk Management (IRM) function provides holistic oversight of the integration of climate considerations into the Risk Management Framework.\nOperational sustainability\n\nWells Fargo is working to embed environmental sustainability throughout our operations to drive efficiencies and responsible resource use, including reducing energy, water, and resource consumption as well as greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWells Fargo continues to work to reduce the emissions, water and energy consumption, and waste associated with its operations.\n\n| Common factors used to measure relative environmental performance | Unit | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Employees\u00b9 | # of employees | 271,924 | 268,531 | 249,435 |\n| Revenue | USD (in billions) | 86.8 | 74.3 | 78.5 |\n| Square footage\u00b2 | # sq ft | 86,179,338 | 82,617,819 | 78,200,000 |\n\nNotes\n1.

Data is specific to mobile devices (iPhone, iPad only).\nWells Fargo calculates its operational Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Scope 1 emissions are direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that occur from sources that are controlled or owned by an organization. Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions associated with the purchase of electricity, steam, heat, or cooling, and are a result of the organization\u2019s energy use.\n\n### Water\n\n| Total water consumption (municipal water use) | Cubic meters | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------------|------|------|------|\n| Reduction in water consumption (from 2019 baseline) | % | 0 | 14 | 30 |\n\n### Scope 1 and Scope 2 (location & market based) Emissions\n\n| Emissions | Unit | 2019 | 2020 | 2021* |\n|-----------|------|------|------|-------|\n| Stationary combustion | MTCO2e | 72,238 | 67,430 | 59,342 |\n| Mobile combustion | MTCO2e | 3,080 | 579 | 683 |\n| Refrigerants and fire suppressants | MTCO2e | 11,285 | 10,078 | 13,293 |\n| Total Scope 1 | MTCO2e | 86,602 | 78,087 | 73,319 |\n| Purchased electricity | MTCO2e | 768,266 | 691,019 | 569,079 |\n| District heating | MTCO2e | 3,061 | 2,992 | 554 |\n| Total Scope 2 (location) | MTCO2e | 771,327 | 694,011 | 569,633 |\n| Purchased electricity | MTCO2e | 1,927 | 623 | 1,238 |\n| District heating | MTCO2e | 3,061 | 2,991 | 554 |\n| Total Scope 2 (market) | MTCO2e | 4,988 | 3,614 | 1,792 |\n| Total Scope 1 and 2 (location) | MTCO2e | 857,929 | 772,098 | 642,952 |\n| Total Scope 1 and 2 (market) | MTCO2e | 91,591 | 81,701 | 75,111 |\n| Carbon offsets purchased | MTCO2e | 98,981 | 92,019 | 81,809 |\n| Net Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market) | MTCO2e | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Reduction in total Scope 1 and 2 (location) GHG emissions (from 2019 baseline) | % | 0 | 10 | 25 |\n\n**Notes**\n\n1. MTCO2e stands for metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent.\n2. Wells Fargo has purchased carbon offsets to achieve carbon neutrality for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions since 2019.\n3. A location-based method reflects the average emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs (using grid-average emission factor data). A market-based method reflects emissions from electricity that Wells Fargo has purposefully chosen. It derives emission factors from contractual instruments, which include any type of contract between two parties for the sale and purchase of energy bundled with attributes about the energy generation, or for unbundled attribute claims.\n4. Total Scope 1 emissions in 2019 and 2020 have been restated to reflect a correction to the emissions calculation for stationary combustion.\n\n**References**\n\n- Environmental Data Assurance (PDF)\n- CDP Report (PDF)\n| Scope 3 Emissions | Unit\u00b9 | 2019       | 2020       | 2021*       |\n|-------------------|-------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Category 1: Purchased goods and services\u00b2 | MTCO2e | 2,304,829  | 1,639,281  | 1,429,619  |\n| Category 2: Capital goods\u00b2 | MTCO2e | 455,599    | 358,268    | 348,249    |\n| Category 3: Fuel and energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2) | MTCO2e | 148,420    | 123,970    | 121,357    |\n| Category 4: Upstream transportation and distribution\u00b3 | Not relevant | Not relevant | Not relevant | Not relevant |\n| Category 5: Waste generated in operations | MTCO2e | 9,921      | 7,622      | 13,058     |\n| Category 6: Employee business travel (air travel only)\u2074 | MTCO2e | 71,019     | 14,111     | 4,795      |\n| Category 7: Employee commuting | MTCO2e | 613,405    | 313,757    | 218,795    |\n| Category 8: Upstream leased assets\u00b3 | Not relevant | Not relevant | Not relevant | Not relevant |\n| Category 9: Downstream transportation and distribution\u00b3 | Not relevant | Not relevant | Not relevant | Not relevant |\n| Category 10: Processing of sold products\u00b3 | Not relevant | Not relevant | Not relevant | Not relevant |\n| Category 11: Use of sold products\u00b3 | Not relevant | Not relevant | Not relevant | Not relevant |\n| Category 12: End of life treatment of sold products\u00b9 | Not relevant | Not relevant | Not relevant | Not relevant |\n| Category 13: Downstream leased assets\u00b3 | Not relevant | Not relevant | Not relevant | Not relevant |\n| Category 14: Franchises\u00b3 | Not relevant | Not relevant | Not relevant | Not relevant |\n| Category 15: Investments\u00b3,\u2075 | Relevant, not calculated | Relevant, not calculated | Relevant, not calculated | Relevant, not calculated |\n\nNotes\n\n\u00b9Wells Fargo\u2019s environmental data included in the Statements of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions has been reviewed by an independent third-party accountant for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n\u00b2MTCO2e stands for metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent.\n\n\u00b3In 2020, Scope 3, Category 1 and Category 2 emissions reporting transitioned to USEEIO 1.0 emissions factors from previously utilized UK DEFRA emissions factors.

Through the end of 2021, Wells Fargo contracted for 210 megawatts (MW) of new renewable energy generation across 13 states and three countries, supporting new job creation and creating resilient communities.\n\n| Renewable energy consumed                                      | Unit | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Self-supply\u00b9                                                   | MWh  | 586   | 534   | 551   |\n| Physical power purchase agreements (PPA)\u00b2                     | MWh  | 10,694| 7,503 | 62,858|\n| Total long-term commitments supporting new renewable energy assets\u00b3 | MWh  | 11,280| 8,037 | 63,409|\n| Unbundled Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)\u2074                | MWh  | 1,814,780| 1,658,740| 1,610,463|\n| Total renewable energy purchased                               | MWh  | 1,826,060| 1,666,777| 1,673,872|\n| Percent of consumed electricity as renewable                   | %    | 101   | 101   | 108   |\n| Total capacity from long-term agreements supporting new sources of renewable energy\u2075 | MW   | 40    | 186   | 210   |\n\nNotes\n1. Self-supply is when a consumer generates and supplies their own electricity. Wells Fargo\u2019s self-supply refers to its on-site solar program.\n2. Physical power purchase agreements are contracts for the purchase of power and associated Renewable Energy Certificates from a specific renewable energy generator (the seller) to a purchaser of renewable electricity (the buyer).\n3. Wells Fargo met 100% of its electricity consumption with renewable energy, primarily from unbundled Renewable Energy Certificates beginning in 2017. Its goal is to transition to long-term agreements (defined as contracts with a duration of five years or longer) that directly support new sources of renewable energy. New sources of renewable energy are defined as assets where commercial operation was achieved no earlier than 12 months prior to contract execution.\n4. Unbundled Renewable Energy Certificates are sold, delivered, or purchased separately from the electricity generated by the renewable resource.\n5. This data includes cumulative new renewable energy generation capacity contracted by Wells Fargo. Some assets have not yet achieved commercial operation and are under construction.\nSupplier engagement\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s Supplier Code of Conduct (PDF) outlines the company\u2019s expectation that suppliers not only comply with applicable laws, regulations, and contract terms, but also conduct themselves with the highest standards of ethical business practices, environmental stewardship, and community investment.\n\n| Integrating ESG into supplier selection and engagement\u00b9 | Unit | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Suppliers invited to participate in CDP survey         | # of suppliers | 209  | 198  | 188  |\n| Supplier CDP survey participation                      | % participation | 64   | 72   | 74   |\n| Responding suppliers who have self-reported science-based targets for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions | % of suppliers | 33   | 35   | 47   |\n\nNotes\n1. Wells Fargo encourages its suppliers to demonstrate their commitment to environmental sustainability by participating in the CDP survey. The suppliers were selected to participate using a methodology that considered each supplier\u2019s spend, operational criticality to Wells Fargo, and whether the supplier is in a carbon-intensive industry. As a result, the majority of participating suppliers represent high spend and/or high criticality with many in high-carbon industries.\nSocial impact\nSupporting customers and communities\n\nWells Fargo focuses its social impact on building a sustainable, inclusive future for all by supporting financial health, housing affordability, and small business growth through employee volunteerism, strategic philanthropy, and products and services.\n\nWells Fargo donated nearly $615 million in charitable contributions in 2021.\n\nFinancial health\n\nAn inclusive economy is one where everyone has a pathway to economic opportunity, including the financial knowledge, skills, and resources necessary to support themselves and their families. That\u2019s why Wells Fargo is committed to providing a variety of resources and products designed to enable individuals to learn how to manage money responsibly, build and improve credit, plan and save for the future, and reach their financial goals. Examples of Wells Fargo\u2019s commitment to support financial health include:\n\n- **Hands on Banking** is Wells Fargo\u2019s free, noncommercial financial education program intended to teach money management skills for all life stages, where users can learn at their own pace. The program provides tools to help teachers, nonprofit financial counselors, and Wells Fargo employee volunteers deliver financial education in schools and communities.\n\n- **The Smarter Credit Center** includes resources to help customers understand, build, and improve credit, as well as manage debt and plan for large purchases.\n\n- Through **CollegeSTEPS**, a website Wells Fargo created to help college students manage their money, students can access guidance and resources on topics such as paying for college, finding scholarships, understanding credit, managing money, and preparing for the next steps after college.\n\nReferences\n\nCommunity impact map\n\n| Philanthropy | Unit | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|--------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Total philanthropic giving (excluding Open for Business Fund) | USD (in millions) | 455 | 390 | 280 |\n| Open for Business Fund | USD (in millions) | N/A | 85 | 335 |\n\n1 Wells Fargo does not control this website.

As part of the capital investment, the MDIs will have access to Wells Fargo expertise and assistance.\n\n\u2022 As the exclusive sponsor of the Military Family Financial Readiness Council, led by the Military Family Advisory Network, Wells Fargo is committed to empowering service members and veterans, as well as their families, to gain financial knowledge and skills that can help them manage all stages of life, from permanent change of station to deployment to retirement.\n\n\u2022 A national alliance between Wells Fargo and Disability:IN provides continuing education opportunities for disability-owned business enterprises and service-disabled veteran disability-owned business enterprises.\n\n\u2022 The **Wells Fargo Investment Institute (WFII)** provides education, guidance, and insights to inform investment decisions. The Wells Fargo Investment Institute\u2019s Social Impact Investing team specializes in managing sustainable and responsible investment portfolios for individuals and institutions. In 2021, a new client-specific ESG report was released, which utilizes vendor and proprietary data from the Global Manager Research team within Wealth and Investment Management, to provide ESG risk, product involvement, and carbon footprint data on client holdings.\n\u2022 Wells Fargo is committed to older adult consumers. In collaboration with the Aging Client Services Center of Excellence (ACSCOE) within the Office of Consumer Practices, Wells Fargo is enhancing the financial protection of older and vulnerable adult customers by advising its lines of business on best practices for preventing, detecting, reporting, and responding to older and vulnerable adult financial exploitation. For example, the ACSCOE recently advised on a major Wells Fargo elder fraud education campaign, which included direct customer emails, messaging on account statements, ATM banner alerts, and narratives delivered through Wells Fargo Stories. Additional consumer education resources were provided and include: Protecting those you love (PDF), Protecting older adults from fraud, and How to recognize scams targeting older adults.\n\n\u2022 Providing customers with free access to their FICO Score, as illustrated by the following table:\n\n| Customers accessing their FICO\u00ae Score | Unit | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|--------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Enabled customers to better manage their credit by providing free access to their FICO\u00ae Score\u00b9 | # of customers (in millions) | 9.2 | 10.8 | 11.3 |\n\nNotes\n1.

In 2021, program participants saved nearly $18 million and reduced debt by roughly $38.4 million, more than 27,300 participants established or improved their credit score, and more than 7,800 participants acquired a financial asset. Grantees include Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund, International Rescue Committee, Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), National Association of Latino Community Asset Builders, Operation HOPE, and others. Additionally, grants expanded access to free, virtual financial coaching and counseling, direct cash assistance, and other financial resources to help people save money, reduce debt, and navigate other complex financial challenges.\n\nIn 2017, Wells Fargo pledged to create at least 250,000 new Black and African American homeowners in 10 years through lending $60 billion for home purchases. Through the end of 2021, the company helped over 81,756 Black and African American families and individuals become homeowners with $21.4 billion in mortgage financing.\n\nIn 2016, Wells Fargo committed to increasing Hispanic and Latino homeownership over 10 years through $125 billion in home purchase loans. Through the end of 2021, the company helped 207,248 Hispanic and Latino families and individuals become homeowners through $54.8 billion in mortgage financing.\n\nHousing affordability solutions\n\nWells Fargo recognizes that there is a shortage of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income communities, and high housing costs have amplified growing economic inequities. In 2021, the company launched the Wells Fargo Dream.Plan.Home.SM mortgage, which offers a down payment as low as 3% to eligible buyers and supports approval of those with nontraditional credit.\n\nIn 2021, the company financed $29.6 billion and $7.8 billion for new purchase loans to serve over 58,000 minority households and over 38,000 low- and moderate-income households respectively.\nWells Fargo has a $25 million total commitment to support Black and African American, Hispanic, and Latino homebuyers with financial education and counseling, with $15 million committed to Black and African American homebuyers and $10 million committed to Hispanic and Latino homebuyers. Through the end of 2021, more than $11 million and $9 million in funding have been provided in support of Black and African American homebuyers and Hispanic and Latino homebuyers respectively.\n\nHousing affordability philanthropy\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s housing affordability philanthropic strategies are focused on keeping people in their homes, opening pathways to homeownership, increasing initiatives that drive supply of affordable homes, and advancing innovation and transformation. Wells Fargo\u2019s goal is to support solutions that allow people to have a quality and affordable place to call home. Since 2020, the company has helped keep more than 320,000 renters and homeowners in their homes through efforts focused on eviction and foreclosure prevention assistance, rental assistance, and financial counseling. Wells Fargo has also committed $1 billion in philanthropy to supporting housing affordability solutions across the nation. Examples of Wells Fargo\u2019s housing affordability philanthropy initiatives include:\n\n- Through the Wells Fargo Builds program, in collaboration with Habitat for Humanity and Rebuilding Together, Wells Fargo funded more than 482 home build projects across the U.S. in 2021. This funding of affordable and sustainable housing includes support for new home construction and repairs, helping older adults age in their homes, and neighborhood revitalization.\n\n- Through Wells Fargo\u2019s NeighborhoodLIFT\u00ae program, the company collaborates with NeighborWorks\u00ae America and local nonprofits to support sustainable homeownership by delivering down payment assistance to low- and moderate-income homebuyers. This program supports individuals, both customers and noncustomers, in a number of communities throughout the U.S. While the LIFT program is focused on serving low- and moderate-income families regardless of race or ethnicity, the majority of LIFT homeowners represent those who identify as Black and African American, Indigenous, and people of color.\nServing small business\n\nSmall businesses are essential to a vibrant economy and for creating employment opportunities. Wells Fargo proudly serves over three million small business customers by putting the needs of customers front and center, innovating experience through digital enhancements, and evolving its support model to deepen relationships. Wells Fargo\u2019s goal is to be the bank of choice for all small businesses, with a strong emphasis on supporting the needs faced by diverse and women-owned small business owners. Wells Fargo has established a number of initiatives, tools, and programs to support small businesses to help them go from surviving to thriving.\n\nWells Fargo has provided approximately 282,000 Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans through its 2020 and 2021 lending to support small businesses navigating the COVID-19 pandemic. Total lending was nearly $14 billion helping keep 1,739,000 Americans employed. The average loan amount for customers was $50,000, the lowest among all of the participating large financial institutions, and 42% of loans were for small businesses in low-to-moderate income neighborhoods, or those historically underserved, bringing funding to places where it could make the biggest impact.\n\nSmall business growth philanthropy\n\nWells Fargo continues to deepen its commitment to small business growth through supporting innovative nonprofit programs aimed at providing entrepreneurs with increased access to affordable sources of capital and training so businesses can grow, build assets, and create local jobs.\n\nWells Fargo established the Open for Business Fund in 2020 by voluntarily donating all gross processing fees from PPP loans made in 2020 to provide grants for Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and other nonprofit organizations that provide capital and technical support to diverse-owned small businesses. In 2021, Wells Fargo fulfilled its roughly $420 million Open for Business Fund commitment to support an inclusive economic recovery for small businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through the Open for Business Fund, from 2020 through the end of 2021, grants were awarded to more than 235 CDFIs and nonprofits, which are estimated to serve more than 152,000 small businesses and preserve or create more than 255,000 jobs. Roughly 85% of small businesses served are projected to be those hardest hit by the pandemic, including Black and African American, Hispanic, Native American, and Asian American-owned small businesses.\nThe Wells Fargo Diverse Community Capital (DCC) program is a multi-year $175 million program to empower diverse small business owners with access to capital and technical assistance by teaming up with CDFIs to support borrowers in all 50 states; Washington, D.C.; and Puerto Rico. The program\u2019s CDFI awardees leveraged Diverse Community Capital funds to provide $2.9 billion in financing and 2.6 million hours of technical assistance, enabling entrepreneurs to sustain more than 369,000 jobs. In 2021, Wells Fargo reached full funding of the $175 million program commitment.\n\n### Open for Business Fund\n\n| Unit | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|\n| # of awards funded | 51 | 223 |\n| USD (in millions) | 85 | 335 |\n| # of jobs | 36,340 | 222,560 |\n| # of small businesses | 12,580 | 139,450 |\n\n| Awardees with women, veterans, and those who self-identify as LGBTQ leaders | % of awardees | 53 | 48 |\n| Awardees with women leaders | % of awardees | 39 | 44 |\n| Awardees with Black, African American, Hispanic, Latino, Native American, Alaskan Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander or multi-racial leaders | % of awardees | 45 | 51 |\n\n### Diverse Community Capital\n\n| Unit | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n| Diverse Community Capital (DCC) Program \u2014 grant capital awards | USD (in millions) | 23.6 | 28.2 | 0 |\n| # of CDFIs | 27 | 34 | 0 |\n| DCC Program \u2014 debt capital awards | USD (in millions) | 2.8 | 19.1 | 12.0 |\n| # of CDFIs | 4 | 7 | 3 |\n| Total DCC capital provided | USD (in millions) | 26.4 | 47.3 | 12.0 |\n| Jobs created/retained by diverse small businesses | # of jobs | 91,324 | 100,497 | 75,403 |\n| Technical assistance provided to diverse small businesses | # of hours | 1,621,159 | 546,565 | 216,901 |\n| Amount financed to diverse small businesses by CDFIs receiving a DCC award | USD (in millions) | 858.3 | 681.2 | 693.0 |\n| Loans to diverse small businesses by CDFIs receiving a DCC award | # of loans | 108,444 | 91,316 | 113,292 |\n\n### Notes\n\n1.

Since the launch, the Small Business Resource Navigator has connected millions of dollars in credit requests from underrepresented small business owners to CDFIs.\n\nCorporate and commercial customers\n\nWells Fargo strives to support its corporate and commercial customers as they seek financial solutions to execute their long-term resiliency, social impact, and sustainability objectives. In 2021, Wells Fargo deployed more than $60 billion in sustainable financing with more than 80% of that in support of corporate customers\u2019 environmental and social activities. Wells Fargo is a leading sustainability-linked loan provider helping customers finance both environmental and social-related activities across a range of industry segments and products in lending and capital markets.\n\nThe Renewable Energy & Environmental Finance (REEF) team at Wells Fargo has invested more than $13.2 billion in ~600 wind, solar, and fuel cell projects across the U.S., providing financing to ~12% of utility-scale wind and solar capacity additions between 2005 and 2021.\n\nIn 2021, Wells Fargo issued an Inclusive Communities and Climate Bond, its first sustainability bond, which funded projects and programs that support housing affordability, socioeconomic opportunity, and renewable energy. The transaction built on Wells Fargo\u2019s expertise in, and history of, underwriting green, social, and sustainability bonds, and advances the company\u2019s commitment to accelerate a more inclusive and sustainable economy.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s Sustainability Bond Framework (PDF) is available on the company website. Sustainalytics, an external firm with expertise in ESG and sustainability, reviewed this Framework and issued a Second Party Opinion (PDF), which found it to be \u201ccredible and impactful,\u201d aligned with the Sustainability Bond Guidelines 2018, Green Bond Principles 2018, and Social Bond Principles 2020.\n\n\u2020 Wells Fargo does not control this website.

The Wells Fargo Innovation Incubator (IN\u00b2) is a $50 million collaboration with the United States Department of Energy\u2019s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) that aims to speed the path to market for technology startups focused on sustainability and resiliency in the built environment (i.e., man-made environment), as well as sustainable agriculture.\n\n| Wells Fargo Innovation Incubator (IN\u00b2) | Unit | 2019     | 2020     | 2021     |\n|----------------------------------------|------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Grant dollars awarded                  | USD  | 1,295,000| 3,119,457| 1,971,000|\n| Organizations supported                | # of | 43       | 74       | 23       |\nEmployee volunteerism and impact\n\nWells Fargo is proud of the passion and generosity of its employees, who multiply the company\u2019s community impact through the investment of their time, energy, and resources to their respective communities. To help encourage this commitment, Wells Fargo provides eligible employees with up to 16 hours of paid volunteer time every year to serve local communities where they live and work. Employees are encouraged to use their talents to get involved in causes they care about.\n\nWells Fargo provides eligible employees with up to 16 hours of paid volunteer time every year to serve local communities where they live and work.\n\n2021 highlights include:\n\n- The Global Fellows program provides Wells Fargo employees a unique opportunity to donate their time and professional skills in support of charities inside and outside of the U.S. In 2021, the program doubled the number of projects and employees participating compared to the previous year. Additionally, the program expanded its partners to include national grant funded organizations in the U.S. that are aligned with the Wells Fargo Foundation\u2019s strategic priorities.\n\n- The Community Care Grants program recognizes Wells Fargo employees for their giving and service activities.

Employees volunteered virtually and in their individual capacity.\n\n2. Employee participation percentage is based on the total number of active, global employees in Wells Fargo\u2019s workforce as shown in the Employees section.\n\n3. In 2020, Wells Fargo transitioned from an annual giving campaign to year-round giving campaigns, allowing employees more flexibility when determining how and when they want to support nonprofits. This adjustment impacted programming and how employees log personal financial commitments in the company\u2019s Community Care Portal. The 2020 and 2021 results reflect employee giving that occurred in the Community Care Portal throughout the respective fiscal years.\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion\n\nWells Fargo is dedicated to diversity, equity, and inclusion with a belief that companies should have their executive ranks reflect the customers they serve and the U.S. population more broadly. The company also believes financial institutions should strive to provide affordable, easy-to-use products and services, enable the dream of homeownership, and help in the formation and growth of small businesses in all communities. In addition to focusing on diversity across the company\u2019s workforce, Wells Fargo supports strategic opportunities that include diverse suppliers in competitive sourcing and procurement opportunities within our supply chain. In 2022, Wells Fargo released its inaugural Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I) report (PDF), providing important updates on our efforts in this space.\n\nIn connection with its diversity initiatives, Wells Fargo voluntarily requests that its employees and Board members self-identify their gender.

Data reflects Wells Fargo\u2019s U.S. employees aligned to job categories as outlined by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) job category definitions. EEO job categories have been omitted from the report where Wells Fargo did not have jobs aligned to these categories for a given reporting year.\n\n2. Year-over-year fluctuation in job category totals may be attributed to realignment of jobs into EEO job categories, hiring, attrition, and employee movement within Wells Fargo.\n\n3. Data is derived from actual Consolidated EEO-1 numbers from the respective reporting years, which typically reflects Wells Fargo\u2019s U.S. employee population as of Dec. 31 of each calendar year.\n\n4. Numbers may differ from other Wells Fargo reports that count employees based on full-time equivalent methodology. Relevant EEO workforce data is compiled using data from HR information system and reflects Wells Fargo U.S. workforce numbers only.\nEmployee Resource Networks\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s Employee Resource Networks (ERNs) are open to all employees and are organized by employees connected by a shared background, experience, or other affinity. They were formed to elevate and increase visibility to historically underrepresented groups. With Wells Fargo\u2019s support, ERNs are focused on professional growth and education, community outreach, recruiting and retention, business development, and customer insight. There are approximately 65,624 memberships across Wells Fargo\u2019s Employee Resource Networks.\nEmployees\n\nWells Fargo is committed to being an employer of choice \u2014 a company where people matter; teamwork is rewarded; everyone feels respected and empowered to speak up; diversity, equity, and inclusion are embraced; and how work gets done is just as important as getting the work done.\n\nCulture\n\nWells Fargo is committed to a culture that attracts and retains the best people who help it become a better, stronger company. The company\u2019s culture is reinforced by a customer-centric focus, employee engagement and feedback, and expectations that guide how employees conduct themselves, work with customers and colleagues, and make decisions.\n\nCompany expectations are part of the culture \u2014 from how employees develop and communicate, to how Wells Fargo evaluates performance and service of its customers and stakeholders.\nWells Fargo continues to refine its culture, instilling efficiency and effectiveness throughout, leveraging employee feedback to enhance the employee experience and drive improvements. Throughout the year, employees are invited to share their thoughts through surveys, town halls, and other means. Wells Fargo launched a new company-wide employee feedback platform called Loudspeaker at the end of 2021. Employees have submitted thousands of ideas, some of which have been implemented, leading to efficiencies, innovation, and employee engagement.\n\n**Competitive compensation**\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s compensation program is linked to performance management and is designed to promote prudent risk management and reinforce its culture and operating standards:\n\nThe compensation principles include:\n\n- **Pay for performance**: Compensation is linked to company, line of business, and individual performance, including meeting regulatory expectations and creating long-term value consistent with the interests of shareholders.\n\n- **Promote effective risk management**: Compensation promotes effective risk management and discourages imprudent or excessive risk-taking.\n\n- **Attract and retain talent**: People are one of Wells Fargo\u2019s competitive advantages; therefore, compensation helps attract, motivate, and retain people with the skills, talent, and experience to drive superior long-term company performance.\n\nThe company is committed to providing fair, competitive, and equitable compensation. In November 2021, Wells Fargo announced an increase in its U.S. minimum hourly base pay in the majority of its markets. The minimum hourly pay range in the U.S. is $18 to $22, based on the cost of labor in each Wells Fargo market.\n\n**Pay equity review**\n\nWells Fargo is committed to fair and equitable compensation practices, and we regularly review our compensation programs and practices for pay equity. Each year, the company engages a third-party consultant to conduct a thorough pay equity review of employee compensation, which considers gender, race, and ethnicity. The results of the 2021 review, after accounting for factors such as role, tenure, and geography, show that women at Wells Fargo continued to earn more than 99 cents for every $1 earned by their male peers. In addition, U.S. employees of color continue to earn more than 99 cents for every $1 earned by white peers. The results of Wells Fargo\u2019s most recent pay equity analysis and relevant commentary are available in the company\u2019s 2022 Proxy Statement.\nBenefits\n\nWells Fargo provides eligible regular and part-time employees with a comprehensive set of benefits designed to protect their physical and financial health and to help them make the most of their financial future. It also provides employees with a variety of competitive employer-paid financial protection benefits including life insurance, critical illness insurance, short-term and long-term disability coverage, and business travel accident insurance. In many countries, Wells Fargo also provides additional top-up plans and flexible benefits options, such as personal accident coverage.\n\nEmployees may also participate in a stock purchase plan and take advantage of discounts on financial products, home mortgages, and more.\n\nBehavioral health support\n\nIn addition to the mental health management benefits included in Wells Fargo\u2019s health plans, Employee Assistance Consulting (EAC) is a global resource that helps employees and their household members through difficult times.\n\nConfidential individual consultations and referrals are available for personal and work-related concerns, including anxiety and depression, alcohol and drug use, stress management, relationship problems, grief and loss, and financial difficulties. Support is also available to employees affected by robberies, threats, domestic violence, disasters, and critical incidents.\n\nWe Care Fund\n\nThe company\u2019s internal We Care Fund additionally grants emergency aid to employees facing disasters and other severe financial hardships. This employee relief program is funded by Wells Fargo and employees who want to help colleagues in need.\n\n| Employee service and impact | Unit | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------|------|--------|--------|--------|\n| We Care Fund - dollars awarded | USD (in millions) | 5.6 | 27.2 | 1.2 |\n| We Care Fund - grants awarded | # of grants | 2,550 | 23,098 | 1,506 |\n\nNotes\n1. The We Care Fund, a Wells Fargo employee relief fund, grants emergency aid to employees facing disasters and other severe financial hardships.\nWork-life programs and the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nWells Fargo offers many benefits, programs, and work arrangements intended to provide employees with flexibility and work-life balance. During the COVID-19 pandemic, close to 100,000 Wells Fargo employees never left the workplace to ensure customers received the services and support they needed. Others transitioned to working from home. In March 2022, Wells Fargo began its Return to Office program for employees who had not been working from Wells Fargo offices during the pandemic.\n\nWells Fargo believes its success depends on becoming increasingly collaborative and innovative. The company benefits from employees seeing each other on a regular basis. When together, it is easier to build relationships, get in-the-moment coaching, identify career opportunities, and brainstorm ideas. Ultimately, when employees work together they learn more about the customers and communities the company serves and how to serve them better. With this in mind, Wells Fargo\u2019s approach emphasizes spending time together in the office, and also provides flexible work options for employees in certain jobs.\n\nThe company\u2019s expectation for employees working in a Wells Fargo location are based on what makes sense for different roles. For example, employees in customer-facing roles in branches, advisor locations, and other customer-facing locations, have been in the workplace for most of the COVID-19 pandemic. Employees in non-customer-facing support teams are primarily office-based, with flexibility. In practice, this may mean flexibility to have up to two days a week of remote work, and spending a minimum of three days a week in the office. Expectations for other roles, including operations, technology, and non-U.S. based employees, vary by business need. Wells Fargo understands the challenges faced during the pandemic and continues to look for ways to offer flexibility to more employees, while moving to an increasingly collaborative and innovative culture.\n\nThe company continues to monitor the COVID-19 situation and will make adjustments as necessary. The health and safety of employees and customers has been our top priority and has guided planning efforts. All employees globally may take up to four hours of paid time away for each vaccine appointment (including boosters). U.S. employees are additionally eligible to receive free COVID-19 test kits from Wells Fargo or through their medical plan, at no additional cost.\nEmployee training and development\n\nWells Fargo invests heavily in coaching and training for employees and managers because when our employees are properly supported, engaged, and confident in their skills, they\u2019re more effective leaders and can provide a better customer experience. The company invests approximately $200 million annually in employee learning and development, which includes functional training, regulatory compliance, leadership and professional development, and early talent development programs for employees.\n\n| Training and development | Unit | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|--------------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Total annual investment in employee learning and development | USD (in millions) | ~250 | ~200 | ~204 |\n| Annual investment in employee learning and development per employee\u00b9 | USD | ~975 | ~793 | ~704 |\n| Average hours per employee of learning and development time\u00b9 | # of hours | 44.0 | 51.0 | 44.0 |\n| Employee completion of Diversity and inclusion 1: Foundations\u00b2 | % of employees | Not available | 69.0 | 77.0 |\n| Employee completion of Diversity and inclusion 2: Understanding unconscious bias\u00b2 | % of employees | Not available | 83.0 | 88.0 |\n| Employee completion of trainings which contain a focus on discrimination and other topics related to human rights\u00b3 | % of employees | 99.9 | 99.5 | 99.0 |\n| Employee completion of Information Security training\u2074 | % of employees | 100.0 | 99.1 | 100.0 |\n| Employee completion of Anti-Harassment and Discrimination training\u2075 | % of employees | 100.0 | 99.4 | 96.0 |\n\nNotes\n1. Data is based on the number of active, full-time equivalent employees.\n2. All employees are offered training on diversity, equity, and inclusion. Completion is voluntary. The training courses were updated and released to employees in November 2019, and thus results for these courses are not available for 2019.\n3. This training includes the company\u2019s safety training, which covers topics such as emergency response and a violence-free workplace and is assigned to all employees.\n4. This training is assigned to all Wells Fargo employees.\n5. This training is assigned to all U.S. employees.\n\nIn 2021, the Learning and Development team continued to support training virtually in response to COVID-19, and the company continues to implement enhancements to training programs to support more flexible delivery. Wells Fargo received five industry awards in 2021 in recognition of training excellence, including awards for programs in branch banking, small business, technology, and credit.\nLeadership and professional development\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s leadership development training program contributes to the success of participating employees by partnering with them to drive learning that is strategic and effective. It is the company\u2019s mission to contribute to the growth and profitability of Wells Fargo by providing employees with the tools and training necessary for job excellence and career advancement.\n\nLeadership training opportunities are provided through such programs as Leading Through Change and Transition, Extraordinary Leader, Coaching and Feedback in the Moment, and Crucial Conversations.\n\nEmployment impacts\n\nAs Wells Fargo continues transforming its businesses, the company recognizes that employees may be impacted, and strives to provide transparent communication so that employees are aware of the programs and opportunities available to support them.\n\nIn some cases, restructurings result in employee displacements or involuntary separations as a result of economic or operational factors. In the event of a workforce restructuring involving displacements in the U.S., Wells Fargo supports its employees and provides tools to assist them with career transitions, including:\n\n- Wells Fargo\u2019s Displacement policy requires that all displaced employees in the U.S. are provided a 60-day notice period, unless otherwise required by business needs or federal, state, or local laws. Regardless of working or nonworking status, employees are still considered actively employed during the entire notice period.\n- Employees are eligible for eight to 52 weeks of severance pay, based on years of service.\n- Wells Fargo offers displaced employees Career Transition Services through an external vendor.\n- Employees and their household family members can seek free, voluntary, confidential consultation and support for any concerns and challenges with Employee Assistance Consulting (EAC), a team of behavioral health professionals.\n\nIn countries where Wells Fargo operates outside of the U.S., the practices of managing redundancies or displacements, and workforce restructuring, vary based on legal and regulatory requirements, and local market practices. International support may include enhanced severance pay arrangements, employee assistance programs, and career transition services.\nEmployee safety and health\n\nWells Fargo recognizes the importance of providing a safe and healthy environment for employees, customers, and others who are on its premises. The company designed and implemented programs to help reduce the frequency and severity of injuries and illnesses. Wells Fargo also makes special accommodations available to help injured employees return to work when they are able.\n\nWells Fargo is required to comply with applicable facility-related, legally mandated standards for workplace safety and health in the countries and communities in which it operates. Employees are responsible for following safe work practices and for reporting any unsafe working conditions.\n\nNewly hired employees are expected to complete safety and health training, and certain employee groups have quarterly refresher training requirements. Additionally, it is expected that managers provide training on job-specific hazards at the time of an employee\u2019s initial assignment and to provide retraining whenever:\n\n- New substances, processes, procedures, or equipment are introduced into the workplace that represent a new hazard.\n- The manager is made aware of a new or previously unrecognized safety or health hazard.\n- An employee is given a new job assignment and has not received training for that assignment.\n\nGiven the nature of Wells Fargo\u2019s business, cumulative trauma injuries, which are injuries that occur as a result of repetitive activity, and those resulting from slips, trips, and falls, are the most common workplace injuries. Training and awareness resources on these and other topics are accessible for all employees internally via the company\u2019s intranet. At some locations where cumulative trauma injuries could have higher frequency rates, the Site Ergonomic Coordinator Program provides access to on-site Wells Fargo employees trained in hazard identification and basic office ergonomics. Emergency Response and Violence-Free Workplace training is also provided on an annual basis.\n\nAddressing harassment in the workplace\n\nHarassment is against Wells Fargo policy, may violate the law, and will not be tolerated in the workplace or at work-related events. The company prohibits any form of harassment, including sexual harassment, of any employee, contingent resource, vendor, employment applicant, or customer on the basis of an individual\u2019s race, color, gender, national origin, religion, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, genetic information, physical or mental disability, pregnancy, marital status, hairstyles or hair texture, status as a protected veteran, or any other status protected by federal, state, or local law in the U.S.\nGovernance\nWells Fargo\u2019s Board of Directors is committed to sound and effective corporate governance practices.\n\nExecution of Wells Fargo\u2019s sustainability initiatives is coordinated by the Public Affairs team, including groups such as: Sustainability, Social Impact, Communications and Brand Management, and Government Relations and Public Policy, in partnership with businesses and functions across the company. Various management councils and committees provide senior leadership steering and challenge, with formal governance provided by the company\u2019s risk and control committees. At the Board level, the Governance and Nominating Committee (PDF) is responsible for overseeing the Company\u2019s corporate governance practices, and the Corporate Responsibility Committee (PDF) provides primary oversight for significant strategies, policies, and programs related to social and public responsibility.\nBoard of Directors\n\nThe Board remains focused on regular enhancement of its composition, oversight, and governance practices, and on Board succession planning to enable it to continue to oversee the company and its business effectively.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines (PDF), which provide the framework for the governance of the Board and the company, including maintaining the independence of a significant majority of the directors on the Board, and all members of the Audit, Governance and Nominating, Human Resources, and Risk Committees.

forward-looking statements about Wells Fargo\u2019s future financial performance and business. Because forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding the future, they are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements as actual results could differ materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and we do not undertake to update them to reflect changes or events that occur after that date.\n\nFor more information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations, refer to our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d discussion in Wells Fargo\u2019s most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as to Wells Fargo\u2019s other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the discussion under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2021, available on its website at www.sec.gov.\n\nWhile this document describes events, including potential future events that may be generally significant in the context of our ESG priorities and related activities, any such significance does not necessarily equate to the level of materiality of disclosures required under U.S. federal securities laws.\n\nThis document should not be used as a basis for trading in the securities of the Company or for any other investment decision and should not be construed as consisting of investment advice. The Company is not providing any financial, economic, legal, accounting, or tax advice or recommendations. This document reflects certain positions and approaches to ESG as of the date of this document that are subject to change at any time in the Company\u2019s sole discretion without notice, and we do not undertake to update this document to reflect any such changes. Any references to \u201csustainable investing,\u201d \u201csustainable financing,\u201d \u201cESG,\u201d or similar terms in this document are intended as references to the internally defined criteria of the Company, as applicable, and not to any jurisdiction-specific regulatory definition that may exist.\n\nInformation contained herein is sourced from a variety of internal and external sources and may be based on emerging or evolving practices. In addition, disclosures related to environmental sustainability, including disclosures related to the Company\u2019s resource consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as certain internal estimates and assumptions, are based in part on third-party\ndata. Uncertainties, inaccuracies or omissions in any of these inputs potentially have compounding effects on the accuracy and completeness of resulting emissions and resource consumption figures. The suitability of the design and effectiveness of the third-party systems and associated controls over the accuracy and completeness of the data has not been independently assessed. Accordingly, with respect to data that is not also included in the Company\u2019s Statement of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, the Company makes no representations or warranties as to the quality, completeness, accuracy, or fitness for a particular purpose and shall not be liable for any use by any party of, for any decision made or action taken by any party in reliance upon, or for any inaccuracies or errors in, or omissions from, such data. GHG-Protocols require restatement if better information yields materially different base year emissions. Since methodologies and approaches continue to evolve, information we are currently disclosing could later potentially yield materially different emissions and may result in restatement. Other than as stated herein, the Company does not undertake any duty to restate or correct data should such information later prove to be incorrect.\n\nThis document provides general information regarding a number of the Company\u2019s policies, procedures, and positions relating to ESG issues. Although this document aims to present the general position of the Company, the policies, procedures, and positions discussed herein may be subject to approved exceptions.\n\nAll third-party trademarks or brand names are the property of their respective owners.
