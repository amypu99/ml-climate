The content of this report is presented in line with our CSR strategy, which is focused on four key pillars: Operations, Colleagues, Communities and Environment.\n\nThis publication covers Thermo Fisher Scientific\u2019s CSR programs, achievements and performance for our fiscal year from January 1 to December 31, 2021. On December 8, 2021, the Company acquired PPD, Inc., a leading global provider of clinical research services to the pharma and biotech industry. Unless otherwise noted, PPD data is not included in the scope of this report.\n\nTo prepare this report, we considered internationally recognized standards, guidelines and frameworks and have included a reference index for each of the following: United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, the Value Reporting Foundation\u2019s SASB Standards for Medical Equipment and Devices, and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In line with our commitment to transparency, we are continuously working to enhance our reporting and disclosure. See Appendices 1 through 5 for more information.\n\nTo provide further visibility to all our stakeholders, this year we have incorporated additions and changes to our reporting content and structure. Our governance information can now be found in the section Our CSR commitment, where we also cover sustainable finance. We have added a section titled Data summary, which presents our consolidated key performance indicators for our fiscal year 2021. For select environmental performance metrics, Bureau Veritas has provided independent external assurance. Assured data is marked as such in the Data summary, and a copy of the Assurance Statement provides details of the assurance scope, standards used, work undertaken and conclusions.\n\nFor questions or comments regarding this report or Thermo Fisher\u2019s CSR approach, please contact us at responsibility@thermofisher.com.\nAt Thermo Fisher, everything we do is driven by our Mission to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. It is our purpose\u2014the heart of who we are as a Company\u2014and it inspires our more than 100,000 colleagues to bring their best every day. As the world leader in serving science, we know we are here to help make the world a better place.\n\nI\u2019m very proud of the way we delivered on that responsibility in 2021, and I\u2019m deeply grateful to our global team for making it possible because of the importance of the work we do every day. As we help our customers diagnose diseases, develop new treatments, protect our planet and keep people safe, we\u2019re committed to conducting our business the right way. One important aspect of this lies in creating a great work environment for our colleagues.\n\nWe continue to build a vibrant and inclusive culture that embraces unique perspectives and inspires our team members to achieve their full potential. I\u2019m proud that Thermo Fisher is included on Forbes\u2019 list of the World\u2019s Top Female-Friendly Companies and that we\u2019ve received a 100% ranking for LGBTQ+ workplace equality from the Human Rights Campaign for the seventh consecutive year. And once again, Fortune has named us one of the World\u2019s Most Admired Companies.\n\nYet, the truest test of our culture is the feedback we receive from our own team, and one way we gather it is through our annual Employee Involvement Survey (EIS). Our 2021 results were our best yet and told us that our colleagues feel very proud of what we do, have confidence in our leadership, are deeply engaged and feel that we create an inclusive environment. Of course, there\u2019s always more we can do, and we\u2019ll continue to make Thermo Fisher an even better place to work.\n\nOne of the most wonderful attributes of our Thermo Fisher family is our colleagues\u2019 passion for making a difference in their communities. In 2021, we collectively supported more than 100,000 students through our corporate science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) programs and colleague-led Community Action Councils (CACs).\n\nWe also continued to invest in our Foundation for Science, which amplifies our longstanding support for STEM education access. Through the Just Project, we extended our support of free COVID-19 testing at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). The Just Project also includes our commitment to hire at least 500 HBCU graduates through 2023, strengthening diversity and inclusion (D&I) within our Company while also helping to address inequities in our society. Another powerful example of this is our $25 million impact investment to support Black businesses and communities.\n\nOur global responsibility to society also encompasses environmental stewardship, which we bring to life in many ways. We provide technologies that enable scientists to study climate change and help manufacturers monitor emissions to keep air and water clean.\n\nWe continue to develop greener products so our customers can achieve their sustainability goals. In fact, our fully recyclable paper cooler\u2014packaging that our teams developed in 2019 for our temperature-sensitive life sciences products\u2014has already eliminated the use of enough extruded polystyrene foam to fill 24 Olympic-sized swimming pools.\n\nIn 2021, we took another significant step by committing to net-zero emissions by 2050, which builds on our near-term carbon reduction targets. Well before that time, we will transition away from fossil fuels and accelerate our use of new renewable electricity sources. Our Germering, Germany site is setting the example of how we will achieve this goal. Their use of renewables has resulted in zero emissions from the site\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nTo continue providing greater visibility to these priorities and our performance, we are actively enhancing the external disclosures for our ESG activities. To further advance our ESG strategy, we published a Sustainable Financing Framework that outlines how we support global health equity, social justice, eco-friendly scientific discovery and protecting the environment.\n\nI\u2019m very proud of the progress our Company is making. Not only are these actions benefitting society, but they are strengthening our Company and making us a better partner for all of our stakeholders.\n\nI encourage you to read more about our contributions in this report, and I invite you to join us on this journey.\n\nMarc N. Casper\nChairman, President and CEO\nOur Company\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. is the world leader in serving science. Our Mission is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer.

Globally, we have been issued 7,500 patents over the last five years.\n\nIn 2021, we increased our investment in R&D by approximately 19% to $1.4 billion. These investments drive innovation across our business and strengthen our support of customers. As an example, in 2021, we announced new strategic partnerships with the Mayo Clinic, the University of California, Davis, and the University of California, San Francisco. Through these collaborations, we are supporting the development of cutting-edge cancer and cell-based therapies, enhancing diagnostics research and accelerating the adoption of precision medicine.\n\nOur commitment to innovation enables our customers to advance their important work and make the world a healthier place.\n\nInvestment in R&D\n\n| Year | Amount |\n|------|--------|\n| 2021 | $1.4B  |\n| 2020 | $1.2B  |\n| 2019 | $1.0B  |\n\nFeature story\n\nStriving to make the best therapies accessible to all\n\nOver the past decade, our customers have made significant strides in precision medicine with dozens of novel therapies that allow for more personalized and targeted approaches to treatment. When fighting cancer, one prominent cell therapy, chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T), harvests a patient\u2019s immune T-cells, modifies them to target and kill cancer cells, and then reintroduces those cells back into the patient. This therapy has been proven to prevent the relapse of blood cancers. Learn how CAR T helped five-year-old Gideon and his family find hope again.\n\nUnfortunately, the highly customized CAR T approach is costly. To make treatment more accessible, our customers have been exploring ways to scale by using healthy donor T-cells (allogeneic therapies) instead of T-cells from the individual patient (autologous therapies). If successful, CAR T could become more cost-efficient and widely used.\n\nIn 2021, we delivered a product to help customers bring this life-saving therapy to patients faster. Thermo Fisher\u2019s Gibco\u2122 CTS\u2122 OpTmizer\u2122 Pro Serum-Free Medium is a first-of-its-kind media solution specifically formulated to culture healthy donor cells for use in cell therapies. It supports the development and commercialization of allogeneic, off-the-shelf therapies that have the potential to make targeted cancer treatment more affordable and accessible to the many cancer patients in need.\n\n\u201cPrecision medicine is revolutionizing cancer care. We are committed to supporting researchers in advancing the development of allogeneic cell therapies, which can make these life-saving treatments more affordable and widely accessible to cancer patients.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Daniella Cramp\nSenior Vice President and President, BioProduction, Thermo Fisher Scientific\nOur CSR commitment\n\nOperations\nLeveraging our capabilities to support our customers while conducting our business and relationships with integrity\n\nColleagues\nProviding resources and embracing unique perspectives to reach our full potential as one global team\n\nCommunities\nMaking a difference worldwide with an emphasis on promoting STEM education and global health equity\n\nEnvironment\nInnovating to serve our customers while actively minimizing our global footprint\n\nCSR strategy\nAs the world leader in serving science, the products and services we provide to our customers help them tackle some of the world\u2019s greatest societal and environmental challenges. Given our industry position, the scale of our operations, the talent of our colleagues and the depth of our capabilities\u2014all powered by our culture of continuous improvement\u2014Thermo Fisher is uniquely qualified to positively impact the global community.\n\nEvery day, our colleagues are motivated knowing we are contributing to a more sustainable world for future generations. For us, this starts with our Mission and how it inspires the way we run our business.\n\nWe focus our CSR approach on four key pillars\u2014Operations, Colleagues, Communities and Environment. Our strategic framework, comprised of our key pillars, enables us to effectively prioritize and successfully manage the ESG issues fundamental to our business and central to building a sustainable future. To advance our approach and report on our progress, we consider internationally recognized standards, guidelines and reference frameworks. For more information, see Appendices 1 through 5.\n\nOur CSR strategy positions Thermo Fisher for long-term success, leadership and competitiveness as we continue to create a great place to work for our colleagues, provide high-quality products for our customers, deliver strong returns for our shareholders, make a difference in our communities and reduce our impact on the environment.\n\nCorporate governance\nWe believe strong corporate governance is important to ensure that Thermo Fisher is managed for the long-term benefit of our shareholders and other stakeholders. Our success requires a robust and flexible corporate governance framework to support the Board of Directors (Board) in conducting its duties. Corporate governance policies and practices are periodically reviewed, and, as appropriate, the Board adopts new practices that serve the best interests of the Company and our stakeholders. The Board applies a continuous process to oversight and monitoring, assessing both opportunities for and potential risks to the Company. Key responsibilities include oversight of strategy, oversight of risk and succession planning.\n\nCorporate governance framework highlights\n- Board refreshment: The Board actively manages composition and refreshment with the aim of achieving a value-creating and balanced mix of skills, experience, perspective, tenure and background. The importance of diversity within Board refreshment is evidenced by recent additions that increase the directors who are women, racially and ethnically diverse, born outside the US and current or former CEOs. Our current goal is for 30% of our Board to be gender diverse by our 2023 annual meeting of shareholders.\n- Annual director elections\n- Majority voting for election of directors\n- Board oversight of CSR and ESG\n- Active and robust shareholder engagement\n- Declassified Board of Directors\n- Shareholder right to call special meetings\n- Proxy access by shareholders\n- Shareholder right to act by written consent\nFinancing a sustainable future\n\nAt Thermo Fisher, we embed our ESG priorities within our operations to drive ownership and progress toward our commitments. In 2021, our corporate finance organization implemented business practices to advance equity and impact through our investment and treasury strategies.\n\nDiverse partners\n\nOver the course of the year, we continued to grow the network of minority-, women- and veteran-owned banking partners supporting our corporate financial plan. By enlisting these firms in elevated roles and on repeat issuances, we advanced our capital-raising strategies while driving equity and economic opportunity for them.\n\nImpact investments\n\nImpact investments in minority-serving financial institutions help empower historically disenfranchised communities. Leveraging the market for both financial and social returns, in 2021, we committed impact investments totaling $25 million to address racial disparities in health, wealth and opportunity. The $20 million committed to the Local Initiatives Support Corporation\u2019s (LISC) Black Economic Development Fund increased financing to Black-led financial institutions, anchor institutions and businesses. Through the Hope Credit Union\u2019s Transformational\n\nPromoting equity in finance\n\nMinority-, women- and veteran-owned business enterprises (MWVBEs) have long been underrepresented in the financial services industry, hindering innovation and overlooking more than $1 trillion in US gross domestic product (GDP) potential alone. When we launched Thermo Fisher\u2019s Sustainable Financing Framework and planned to issue our inaugural sustainability bond offering, we enlisted five trusted MWVBEs in our underwriting syndicate. Academy Securities, AmeriVet Securities, Blaylock Van, Loop Capital and R. Seelaus & Company were among our portfolio of partners and, during 2021, served as active co-managers for $9 billion of Thermo Fisher bonds issuances in the US and passive co-managers for \u20ac8 billion of bonds issued in Europe. Included in the latter was our first sustainability bond issuance. With their diverse expertise, perspectives and networks, these five institutions helped maximize investor demand for our offering, which raised \u20ac550 million toward increasing access to healthcare, vaccines and medicines; building sustainable equity and inclusion; enabling eco-friendly scientific discovery; and protecting and preserving the environment. By partnering with MWVBEs, we achieve our financial goals while advancing social justice and economic inclusion.\n\n\u201c When we serve as an active co-manager of a large and important transaction like Thermo Fisher\u2019s, we accelerate our mission to create and enhance the opportunity set for women in finance and the community. Our success allows us to increase investments in maternal health, financial literacy and girls\u2019 empowerment programs.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Elizabeth Peck\nManaging Director, R. Seelaus & Co.\nCatalyzing economic development\n\nAs part of our commitment to driving diversity and inclusion throughout our business, Thermo Fisher has engaged in impact investing to advance equity through our financial practices.\n\nThe multiplier effect of impact investing allows our Company to drive sustainable and inclusive growth. One example is in Washington, DC\u2019s most underinvested neighborhood, where more than 90% of residents are Black and the community is plagued by the city\u2019s highest rates of poverty, food insecurity and chronic disease. This is where the MLK Gateway Plaza II is being built. The mixed-use commercial development project is being led by a local, Black-owned real estate services firm that, in 2021, closed an $8 million bridge loan financed by the LISC initiative Thermo Fisher supports. The project has sparked significant local partnerships and engaged minority-owned contractors and subcontractors. Confirmed tenants include a government agency as the anchor and national companies, job training programs, retailers and neighborhood amenities that will accelerate the revitalization of this historic community.\n\n\u201cThese types of projects Thermo Fisher has invested in set off a chain of events\u2014first by growing businesses that have diverse head-counts, next by indirectly supporting diverse subcontractors and finally by benefiting underserved communities.\u201d\n\n\u2014 George Ashton\nPresident, LISC Fund Management, LLC\n\nSustainable financing\n\nIn 2021, we published our first Sustainable Financing Framework and, in November, launched a \u20ac550 million sustainability bond, which was among the first to be issued by a life sciences company. Within the underwriting syndicate for this inaugural offering, co-managers of the transaction included Black-, Hispanic-, veteran- and women-owned firms.\n\nOur framework\n\nOur Sustainable Financing Framework advances initiatives that are fundamental to our business and deliver the most positive social and environmental impacts. In a positive second-party opinion from independent reviewer Sustainalytics, our framework is cited as being \u201ccredible and impactful\u201d as well as \u201crobust, transparent, and in alignment with the core components of the Sustainability Bond Guidelines 2021, Green Bond Principles 2021, and Social Bond Principles 2021.\u201d\n\nDeposits Program, we took a regional approach depositing $5 million to help finance small businesses, housing and healthcare in five US states in the South\u2014Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee. Supporting areas underserved by the banking system, we are helping to strengthen Black-owned businesses, Black entrepreneurs and Black communities in the US.\nThese principles and guidelines, published by the International Capital Markets Association, promote the integrity of the sustainable financing market.\n\n**Eligible projects**\n\nOur framework prioritizes innovations and investments in the following social and environmental areas:\n\n- **Increasing** access to healthcare, vaccines and medicines\n- **Advancing** racial equity and social justice\n- **Protecting** and preserving the environment\n- **Enabling** eco-friendly scientific discovery\n\nSocial projects eligible for financing through the framework will either support our COVID-19 pandemic response or D&I efforts across our workforce, business relationships and business practices.\n\nEligible green projects outlined in the framework fall into five categories:\n\n- Renewable energy\n- Energy efficiency\n- Green buildings\n- Sustainable supply chain\n- Sustainable products and processes\n\nThe linkage between each eligible project category and the relevant UN SDGs is outlined throughout our framework.\n\n**Accountability**\n\nAs part of our commitment to post-issuance transparency, Thermo Fisher intends to measure and publicly report on the allocation of net proceeds and the societal and environmental impacts resulting from any sustainable finance instrument. Reporting will recur annually until full allocation of the net proceeds, with the accompanying management attestation and auditor limited assurance.\nAt Thermo Fisher, integrity is fundamental to all aspects of our business. As our customers advance life-changing science, they rely on the depth of our capabilities and trust in the rigor of our ethical practices.\n\nOur unwavering commitment to the highest ethical, quality and safety standards allows us to meet customer demand with speed and at scale.\nTo enable our customers\u2019 success in an increasingly competitive global environment, we leverage our Practical Process Improvement (PPI) Business System which optimizes processes, solves challenges and reduces inefficiencies. Activated by our colleagues, PPI ensures we work smarter for and deliver greater value to our customers. It drives productivity and improves product and service quality to strengthen customer allegiance.\n\nWorldwide, Thermo Fisher takes measures to ensure strong global citizenship practices both internally and across our business relationships. We are committed to conducting our business ethically and in full compliance with our internal systems and the laws of the countries in which we operate.\n\n**Ethics & compliance**\n\nIntegrity is one of Thermo Fisher\u2019s 4i Values, reminding us to honor our commitments, communicate openly and demonstrate the highest ethical standards.\n\nWe require our colleagues to uphold these practices and comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the conduct of our business. The foundation of our compliance program is our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which covers a broad range of topics, including, but not limited to, policies related to conflicts of interest, honest and ethical fair dealing, human rights, insider trading, export control awareness, health and safety, privacy matters, and sexual harassment.\n\n**Engaging colleagues in compliance**\n\nWe train, empower and rely on our colleagues to maintain the highest levels of integrity in our operations. That is why all directors, officers and colleagues of the Company must annually certify that they have reviewed and are in compliance with this code. In addition, all colleagues receive annual training on specific code elements to ensure they have a thorough understanding of the ethics and compliance expectations at Thermo Fisher.\n\nSeveral reporting mechanisms are readily available if a colleague ever has concerns that our policies or expectations are not being upheld. Colleagues are encouraged to report any issues to the Human Resources or Legal departments or through our Ethics Hotline. The Ethics Hotline staff, in conjunction with our Legal department, review and investigate reports and take appropriate action. All concerns and complaints related to accounting or auditing are also forwarded to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. For more information on how colleagues are encouraged to and protected when they report issues on ethics and compliance, please refer to our CSR webpage.\n\n**A culture of integrity**\n\nRegular ethics, compliance and culture communications that leverage engaging technology tools help us drive colleague learning, dialogue and vigilance.\n\nThis year\u2019s annual Compliance and Ethics Week featured a wide range of topics, including data privacy, healthcare compliance, government contracts, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, and global trade compliance. The learning experience also included a new podcast playlist and, through friendly competition, colleagues tested their knowledge with interactive games.\n\nIn addition to fostering awareness and understanding, we evaluate the extent to which our colleagues feel empowered and supported to raise concerns.\n\nOur annual Employee Involvement Survey (EIS) is an important listening tool that provides insights to further shape our culture of integrity. Read more about our EIS in the Colleagues section of this report.\nFor years, there has been a demonstrated industry, scientific, regulatory and societal need to increase the inclusion of historically underrepresented patient populations in clinical trials. This is critical to ensuring medicines are tested in populations that will ultimately use them. It also broadens access to innovative investigational therapies for patients within specific therapeutic or disease areas. Our clinical research business has focused on helping customers meet expanding and changing regulatory requirements. This includes engaging representative, diverse demographic sub-groups in their clinical research studies through innovative patient-focused strategies.\n\nAt a critical point during Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine trials, we took steps to partner with them and create a more balanced participant base. Moderna chose to slow its enrollment timeline to ensure appropriate inclusion of diverse communities that, early in the pandemic, were found to be disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Through our targeted and inclusive recruitment efforts at this stage, 45% of the participants we added to the study were from underrepresented groups, whereas the industry average for diversity inclusion in clinical trials is 25%.4\n\n\u201cThanks to the Moderna and PPD clinical research team, we were able to obtain a more inclusive diverse patient population for our trial. This was a vital step toward earning regulatory approval for the vaccine in order to help protect patients and save millions of lives.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Melanie Ivarsson, PhD\nChief Development Officer, Moderna\n\n25% is the industry average for diversity in clinical trials according to the US FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\n45% of the COVID-19 vaccine trial participants we added were from diverse backgrounds, made possible by our targeted and inclusive recruitment efforts\nQuality management\n\nOur customers depend on our products and services to consistently meet their expectations, and delivering exceptional quality is vital to our long-term success. Given our global footprint and the varied regulatory requirements in the countries where we operate, our Company-wide Quality Policy ensures that our entire organization is focused on quality. The policy reinforces our commitment to continuous improvement and four key stakeholders: customers, colleagues, regulatory authorities, and of course, our Company.\n\nQuality management certifications\n\nGiven the diversity of businesses across Thermo Fisher, our sites hold different certifications. Worldwide, 93% of our sites adhere to cGMPs and/or are certified to ISO 9001, ISO 13485 standards. Some sites, where applicable, additionally hold ISO 17025 certifications. All sites maintain appropriate certifications and registrations required by the regulators of the markets in which we sell our products. For an updated list of certified sites and accompanying standard certifications, please visit our CSR webpage.\n\nCompetency & training\n\nPolicies, standard operating procedures and work instructions are managed through a selection of easily accessible platforms. For third-party audits or external audits, we demonstrate our training programs as part of the local compliance process.\n\nIn addition to mandatory site and job-specific training, we introduce and inform all new colleagues of our quality management system through our \u201cIntroduction to Quality\u201d onboarding learning module, which outlines our quality management systems.\n\nMaking Quality Personal\n\nIn 2021, we introduced a new colleague education campaign to help reinforce our culture of quality. Making Quality Personal centers on the shared responsibility of every colleague to take personal ownership of quality and regulatory compliance. The program helps colleagues draw a connection between their work, our customers and end users, and the ultimate success of the Company.\n\nMaking Quality Personal is an interactive, facilitator-led learning opportunity. During the course, colleagues are guided through four modules showcasing the latest tools and techniques for making quality part of their daily work. This keeps the customer top of mind.\n\n93% of sites adhere to cGMP and/or are certified to ISO 9001, ISO 13485 standards\nEnvironment, health & safety management\n\nThermo Fisher is committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our colleagues, customers and the communities in which we operate. We hold ourselves accountable to the commitments made in our Company-wide Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Policy, and we implement a variety of robust systems and programs to ensure we meet its intent and expectations. All colleagues and business leaders are responsible for ensuring we adhere to this policy and maintain a safety-first mentality.\n\nEHS Management System Policy\n\nWe utilize our EHS Management System (EHS-MS) and the engagement and involvement of our colleagues to maintain a safe working environment. Our EHS-MS sets the requirements and performance expectations to implement our EHS Policy using a continuous improvement approach. All manufacturing, distribution and laboratory sites must adhere to these requirements. Our system has been adapted to Thermo Fisher\u2019s structure and operating philosophy and is consistent with the principles of broadly accepted EHS-MS standards.6\n\nOur EHS-MS Policy in brief\n\n1. Management support and leadership\n2. Colleague participation\n3. Regulatory compliance\n4. Hazard identification and risk management\n5. Education and training\n6. System evaluation and improvement\n\nFor more details on the multiple requirements that must be met and maintained for each element, visit our CSR webpage.\nCorporate EHS Compliance Audit Program\n\nOur Corporate EHS Compliance Audit Program, which operates independently of individual business unit control, conducts periodic, objective and evidence-based evaluations of our locations\u2019 EHS compliance status. Our auditors evaluate site operations for compliance with all applicable environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and other related standards we may adopt and endorse. This corporate-level audit function is in addition to requiring all applicable locations to implement and periodically verify their conformance to our EHS-MS Policy and conduct internal EHS compliance audits. This provides a dual-layer oversight system to objectively assess EHS risk at a site level. We also invoke a process for independent corporate corrective and preventive action to systematically drive closure of all outstanding EHS audit findings in a timely manner. Our auditors work with each site to review closure evidence before formally closing out findings.\n\nIn addition to our internal EHS audit process, all of our major operating sites go through regular external property/loss prevention audits. Our facilities undergo onsite audits to assess business resilience against the risks of fire and destruction caused by natural catastrophes such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, earthquakes and tornados. A site\u2019s audit data is compiled and presented, including recommendations to lower the risk of loss and improve business continuity planning at the facility. From a Company-wide perspective, this site-level audit data is used to develop comprehensive strategies that build resilience into our global network and critical infrastructure through capital investments and emergency planning.\n\nColleague safety\n\nOur EHS professionals are vital to our Company\u2019s success, helping us achieve our business goals by enabling productivity and quality improvements, ensuring stewardship of our colleagues and the environment and creating a strong culture of involvement.\n\nThermo Fisher has established an EHS operation model that consists of a network of EHS professionals at the corporate, regional and site levels who work together to ensure compliance and drive continuous improvement.\n\nThis group of EHS subject matter experts spans a complex global regulatory environment, creating value for the organization by ensuring the implementation of our EHS Policy.\n\nOur PPI Business System combined with our proactive approach to site safety has helped decrease our lost-time injury rate (LTIR) and total recordable injury rate (TRIR) in recent years. Our downward incident trends can be attributed to our strong safety culture and safety commitments at every level of the organization. Examples of our best practices that contribute to these trends include:\n\n- Monthly and quarterly safety bowler reviews\n- Hazard ID reporting and mitigation\n- Supervisor safety training platforms\n- Improved incident management and investigation practices\n- Robust root-cause analysis with applicable corrective and preventive actions\n\n| Lost-time injury rate (per 1 million person-hours worked) | 2021: 0.20 | 2020: 0.19 | 2019: 0.20 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Total recordable injury rate | 2021: 0.45 | 2020: 0.50 | 2019: 0.63 |\n\n400+\nEHS professionals worldwide\nSupply chain transparency\n\nSupplier diversity\n\nOur Supplier Diversity Program aims to proactively promote a procurement process that is more inclusive and representative of our customer base, our colleagues and the communities where we operate. Through it, we provide small and diverse businesses with the opportunity to participate in Thermo Fisher\u2019s procurement events. We understand that by implementing a supplier diversity program, we help create the conditions that stimulate favorable economic and social outcomes for small and traditionally underrepresented business owners. We establish strong relationships with advocacy partners and certifying bodies that promote diverse and small business suppliers and participate in various events and conferences to increase the opportunity for matchmaking. Our Supplier Diversity Program is currently active in the US, and there are plans to expand to additional locations over time.\n\nIn 2021, we established our Corporate Supplier Diversity Policy, reinforcing our commitment to supplier diversity and formalizing the program\u2019s objectives and expectations. We also developed and completed mandatory internal training for our procurement and sourcing specialists in the US. These colleagues play a critical role in upholding our policy and executing our plans. To maintain the integrity of our program, we only account for spending with diverse and small suppliers certified through a third party or registered with the Small Business Administration (SBA). We support data quality by engaging with a supplier diversity solution partner to validate the supplier\u2019s certification status.\n\nIn 2021, we established a partnership with the Diversity Alliance for Science (DA4S) Mentorship Program. This program supports the development and success of diverse suppliers in the marketplace through skill matching with mentoring companies. The program runs on an annual cycle and requires a full-year commitment from both the mentee and the mentoring organization. During our first round of mentorship, we provided a diverse business owner with business planning and marketing coaching relevant to the pharmaceutical industry. Our Chief Procurement Officer, a category leader and a category analyst provided feedback to the mentee throughout the year. In that sense, the program also promotes and expands skill-based mentoring within Thermo Fisher and offers colleagues the opportunity to contribute in a meaningful way through knowledge and skill sharing.\n\nTo learn more about supplier diversity at Thermo Fisher, visit our website.\n\nResponsible sourcing\n\nThermo Fisher has a large, complex global supply chain with tens of thousands of suppliers. For the greatest impact, we engage most deeply with roughly 2,300 suppliers who represent over 80% of our spend. We are also committed to employing proper global citizenship practices in all of our business relationships. As such, we expect all suppliers to conduct their worldwide operations in a manner consistent with sustainable and socially responsible business practices and policies. While recognizing differences in laws and customs around the world, we believe shared values are the cornerstone of supplier relationships. Therefore, we expect all suppliers and their subcontractors to be fully compliant with our Supplier Code of Conduct. Our supplier contracts state that we reserve the right to audit suppliers on all elements of this code and terminate a business relationship if it is determined that a supplier is in violation and cannot demonstrate sufficient improvement.\n\n| Diverse and small supplier spend | 2021: $2.0B | 2020: $1.3B | 2019: $0.7B |\n|---------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n\n9. Diverse and small supplier spend includes spend with diverse and small suppliers certified through a third party or registered with the Small Business Administration (SBA).\nThermo Fisher adheres to international expectations related to supply chain practices and is committed to ensuring that we conduct our global business with respect for human rights and comply with applicable laws and fair labor practices. To access our statements on conflict minerals, human rights and modern slavery, visit our Global Supply Chain webpage.\n\nOur Supply Chain Risk Management program is utilized to map, monitor and lower our supply chain risk based on a variety of internal and external risk factors, including environmental, social and governance risks in the regions where we do business. We use the globally recognized EcoVadis\u2122 platform to assess and help accelerate improvements in our suppliers\u2019 performance in practices affecting the environment, labor and human rights, ethics, and sustainable procurement, and to monitor compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct. To properly assess risk to the extent necessary, our 2025 target is to enroll 80% of direct materials suppliers in this program and for suppliers to meet or exceed our EcoVadis scoring threshold of 45 to demonstrate a strong foundational program. All suppliers not meeting these expectations will engage with Thermo Fisher to deploy a corrective action plan and are reassessed annually until appropriate performance can be demonstrated.\n\nAdditionally, in 2021 we completed a scoping effort on all relevant Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which indicated that roughly 75% of our indirect emissions are generated in our upstream supply chain activities. To address these emissions, we are engaging with suppliers and transportation carriers to set their own science-based targets and report on progress.\n\nWe recognize that a united voice from top companies to their supply chains will incentivize participation from our partners and encourage investment in reporting, target-setting and emissions reduction. To read more about this plan, refer to the Environment section of this report.\n\n| Percentage of direct materials spend assessed for supplier responsibility | 2025 (Target): 80% |\n|---|---|\n| 2021: 31% | 2020: 13% |\nAt Thermo Fisher, we are committed to creating a workforce reflecting the rich cultural, ethnic and experiential diversity of the world around us. As a Company that thrives on innovation, we understand that embracing diverse perspectives and experiences promotes creative problem solving and empowers our colleagues to contribute unique ideas that positively impact and inspire our customers and each other. We are dedicated to fostering and cultivating robust processes and practices around:\n\n- Diversity & Inclusion\n- Culture\n- Talent Management\nOur incredible global team\n\nOur colleagues are our greatest advantage. They bring remarkable talent and dedication to their work each day, and the past two years have been no different. Throughout the pandemic, the commitment of our colleagues has allowed Thermo Fisher to continue to meet customer needs and accelerate our Company\u2019s growth. Our success would not have been possible without every colleague\u2019s contributions to making a positive impact on the world.\n\nTo acknowledge this, we have invested more than $1 billion in special Pandemic Response Recognition Payments throughout 2020 and 2021. Excluding our most senior leaders, all colleagues were issued cash awards in March, July and October 2021 with amounts based on a percentage of base pay. Additionally, colleagues at certain organizational levels were granted a stock option award.\n\n\u201cWe are so thankful for our incredible global team. The special recognition payments we provided to our colleagues are an acknowledgment of the extraordinary role they have played in enabling our customers and driving Company performance throughout the pandemic. The success they helped us achieve made it possible for us to make additional investments in our colleagues, celebrating their unwavering commitment to delivering on our Mission during an unprecedented time.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Lisa Britt\nSenior Vice President, Chief Human Resources Officer, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nDiversity & inclusion\n\nOur success as a Company is directly connected to our ability to attract and retain the best and brightest talent, welcoming them to a work environment where colleague differences are celebrated and supported. By actively fostering an inclusive workplace culture, our colleagues feel they belong, which empowers them to contribute, collaborate and innovate. To continue solving the world\u2019s greatest challenges, we must reflect the diversity of our communities, customers and suppliers.\n\nIn striving to elevate the voices of all colleagues, we are also committed to facilitating access to the resources, programs and internal Company networks that will nurture their individual success. Our diversity & inclusion (D&I) strategy is embedded in every stage of the colleague experience\u2014from recruiting and hiring to training, development and long-term career and succession planning. The strategic framework that guides our progress fosters an inclusive organizational culture, reinforces our infrastructure to ensure equitable practices and activates personal accountability for all to contribute to our success.\nFive years of progress\n\nOur five-year D&I strategic plan has served as our roadmap and guided our progress since 2017. Over this time, we have continued to strengthen our culture of inclusion, embracing diversity as an essential aspect of fulfilling our Mission. **Globally, we have increased the representation of women in executive management roles by 7.2% from 2017 to 2021. Over the same period, US representation of women increased by 1% and racially and ethnically diverse colleagues by 6.2%, including in executive management roles by 8.9% and 2.3%, respectively.**\n\n### Representation\n\n#### Global colleague population\n\n| Year | Male | Female | Undisclosed |\n|------|------|--------|-------------|\n| 2021 | 56.6%| 40.5%  | 3.0%        |\n| 2020 | 57.6%| 40.2%  | 2.3%        |\n| 2019 | 58.8%| 40.4%  | 0.8%        |\n\n#### US colleague population\n\n| Category | 2020 | 2021 |\n|----------|------|------|\n| Women in our total colleague population | 41.3% | 41.5% |\n| Women in executive management roles | 30.2% | 35.1% |\n| Women in leadership roles | 37.1% | 38.3% |\n| Racially and ethnically diverse people in our total colleague population | 37.4% | 39.1% |\n| Racially and ethnically diverse people in executive management roles | 22.2% | 23.2% |\n| Racially and ethnically diverse people in leadership roles | 28.3% | 30.3% |\n\nAdditional details on our D&I and talent indicators can be found in the Data summary.\nCulture\n\nThermo Fisher\u2019s 4i Values of Integrity, Intensity, Innovation and Involvement are the foundation of our culture and fundamental to our continued growth. They guide our colleagues\u2019 interactions with customers, suppliers, partners and each other. Our Involvement focus drives engagement, embraces unique perspectives and facilitates connections that enable colleagues to work as one global team in an environment where all are treated with dignity and respect.\n\nWhile feedback from our colleagues is our key measure of success, we are proud of the external recognition Thermo Fisher has received as a leader in our industry and an employer that prioritizes our people and our culture. In 2021, we were among those in Forbes\u2019 inaugural ranking of the World\u2019s Top Female-Friendly Companies.\n\nCulture of belonging\n\nAt Thermo Fisher, inclusion, empowerment, trust and continuous improvement of the colleague experience are the keys to building belonging. In September 2021, we hosted our inaugural Belonging Week with the theme We Belong Together. The focus of the five-day event was to foster a shared sense of identity, purpose, values and interdependence among colleagues. When colleagues feel a deep connection to the Company and their team, they can experience individual success and career fulfillment.\n\nBusiness Resource Groups\n\nNearly 10 years ago, we launched our first resource group for colleagues. Today, we are proud to sponsor nine global Business Resource Groups (BRGs) that represent a diverse set of affinities:\n\n- African heritage\n- All generations\n- Asian and Pacific Islander heritage\n- Individuals with disabilities\n- Latino Hispanic heritage\n- LGBTQ+ people\n- Veterans and military families\n- Working parents and caregivers\n- Women\n\nBRGs play a critical role in building a culture that encourages and embraces differences and contributes to the Company\u2019s long-term success. By fostering inclusion and belonging, building allyship, and supporting the career growth of colleagues, our BRGs collaborate with the global D&I team to deliver on our business objectives and strategic imperatives. Members of our Company leadership team serve as executive sponsors for BRGs to build allyship and understanding while also maximizing the success and impact of these groups. Our 242 local BRG chapters then activate and embed this work deep within our organization and our local communities.\n\n| Award                                      | Recognizing entity |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| America\u2019s Most Responsible Companies       | Newsweek           |\n| Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion| Disability:IN      |\n| Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality      | Human Rights Campaign|\n| Great Place to Work                        | Great Place to Work\u2122|\n| Top 50 Employers of HBCU Students          | HBCU Connect       |\n| World\u2019s Most Admired Companies             | Fortune            |\n| World\u2019s Top Female-Friendly Companies      | Forbes             |\nCulture of transparency\n\nWe further promote a culture of trust through our commitment to transparency. Company goals, expectations and policies provide clear and consistent guidance that informs how we value and treat our colleagues and how they should engage with one another. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is supported by our 4i Values and reinforces our commitment to ethical business practices, including providing equal employment opportunities. This code expresses our belief that colleagues should be treated fairly and evaluated on their contributions, not on any personal attribute or characteristic.\n\nFor more information, including policies on Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining Agreements, please refer to our Global Equal Employment Opportunity and Human Rights Policy.\n\nListening to our colleagues\n\nWe take pride in our award-winning culture and work to continuously improve it. As a critical input to that process, we greatly value mutual transparency and feedback from our colleagues, which we track and quantify through our annual Employee Involvement Survey (EIS).\n\nEach year, the EIS formally captures the voices and perspectives of our colleagues and is used to influence our Company-wide goals, drive leader action plans and develop more opportunities for colleagues to grow and innovate. To ensure universal accessibility, we have made the EIS mobile-friendly and available in 23 language offerings. The survey captures colleague feedback and provides comprehensive and insightful analytics to our leaders and managers in the following three areas:\n\nLeadership\nSupporting managers and Company leadership to improve overall performance\n\nInclusion\nFostering a workplace where everyone is valued for their individual differences\n\nInvolvement\nColleague engagement at the Company\n\nWe saw strong and increased participation in our 2021 EIS, with 86% of our colleagues completing the survey\u2014an increase of two percentage points from the prior year. We also received more than 120,000 written comments. When colleagues take the time to provide this deeper feedback, it demonstrates they feel their opinions are truly valued. And with their detailed input, Thermo Fisher can be more nuanced and purposeful in how we continuously improve.\n\n86% EIS survey participation by all colleagues\n\nCulture of well-being\n\nOver the last few years, our colleagues have managed unprecedented challenges, both professionally and personally. To help them live full and healthy lives, we offer a comprehensive total rewards package.\n\nWe support our colleagues with focused efforts to promote:\n\n- Health and happiness\n- Finances and the future\n- Advancement and recognition\n- Balance and time away\n\nGlobally, we offer Thermo Fisher colleagues and their families participation in our Employee Assistance Program (EAP). The EAP provides confidential assistance for a wide range of personal and work-related issues, including stress management, financial or legal concerns, and home life referrals. Our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) is available in more than 20 countries. We offer regular, full-time and part-time colleagues, including interns, the opportunity to purchase Company stock at a discount. Additionally, to further support personal and professional development, we provide tuition reimbursement to colleagues in the US, Canada and Puerto Rico.\n\nFor more information on these and similar offerings, please refer to the benefits and total rewards section of our website.\n\nTo learn more about our culture of safety, please visit the Environment, health & safety section of this report.\nThe talent and extraordinary skillsets of our colleagues drive our business forward. We want all colleagues to achieve their career goals and aspirations, and we encourage them by investing in development at all career stages\u2014from interns and early career professionals to managers and executive leaders. We remain committed to developing and managing our diverse global workforce by continuously scaling our talent pipeline, enhancing our colleagues\u2019 skills and knowledge and providing the mentorship and resources colleagues need to thrive at Thermo Fisher. Our goal is simple\u2014to improve our talent development process by creating positive candidate and colleague experiences through the complete talent life cycle.\n\n**Talent attraction & acquisition**\n\nWhen we offer candidates the opportunity to join Thermo Fisher, we are providing them with an opportunity to realize their best personally and professionally. This year, more than 30,000 new colleagues joined us in making a meaningful impact on society. The Talent Acquisition team plays a critical role in ensuring we attract, hire and engage with candidates who share our values and have diverse backgrounds and unique skillsets that will enable our customers to solve some of the world\u2019s most pressing challenges.\n\nIn 2021, talent attraction and acquisition played a pivotal role in supporting our Mission. The team deployed technology and automation to meet hiring business objectives and drive awareness and engagement with our global opportunities. Our global career site and other communications channels, available in eight languages, allow us to personalize and localize our outreach and communications.\n\nWe understand that some of the best and brightest minds are just at the beginning of their careers, which is why we invest in meaningful early talent attraction and acquisition programs and create working opportunities for students who will become the next generation of scientists, engineers, functional business leaders and general managers. Each year, we hire over 500 colleagues in the early stages of their careers for our best-in-class programs, which include dynamic opportunities for high school and collegiate internships, co-op programs, apprenticeships, leadership development programs in nine functional areas and various full-time roles.\n\nOur global university relations strategy leverages a diverse network of post-secondary partners from which we proactively recruit and hire undergraduate and graduate students. We use a localized approach for our early talent hiring strategy to meet the needs of our business.\n\nThere are 17 signature partnership schools within our network, including six HBCUs, prioritized for robust engagement based on geography, commercial partnerships, diversity, talent profiles and alumni relations. Together with these institutions, we have curated memorable student experiences, sponsored special events, hosted unique speaker series and established campus ambassador programs. We are committed to expanding our reach to underrepresented students by offering virtual sessions for Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSI) to introduce students to our opportunities and connect them to our managers.\n\n**Welcoming new colleagues**\n\nFirst impressions count. Thermo Fisher actively evolves our onboarding approach as we strive to continuously elevate each new colleague\u2019s experience. The New Colleague Onboarding program is designed to create a sense of belonging, instill both confidence and competence in our new colleagues as they move into their new roles, and align them with our Mission. This begins with a series of easy-to-navigate tasks and checklists during our candidate pre-hire experience that seamlessly transition into an interactive and engaging onboarding journey spanning their first 90 days.\n\nManagers are critical to this new colleague experience and are supported with a series of resources and action items, including the development of customized 90-day onboarding plans and an automated process for assigning new colleague ambassadors, which help create a sense of belonging from day one. By equipping our new colleagues with the tools they need to be successful in their roles and connecting them to our values and Mission, we create the environment for them to begin building their Thermo Fisher careers.\nFrom day one onward, we launch an immersive, two-way learning journey to onboard our new colleagues and continue to educate and inspire them throughout their career. This dynamic series supports a phased learning approach with early content modules of the learning journey covering Thermo Fisher\u2019s cultural fabric, codes and policies, and expanded business capabilities. Over time content has been expanded to include customer experience, our PPI Business System, long-term growth, our CSR strategy and beyond.\n\nIn welcoming new colleagues, our key principles for a successful onboarding experience include:\n\n- Connecting to our Mission, purpose and business\n- Cultivating an open and inclusive culture\n- Instilling confidence while enhancing knowledge and collaboration\n\nIn December 2021, Thermo Fisher welcomed 30,000 new colleagues through our acquisition of PPD, Inc., forming our Clinical Research business. These new team members bring unique experiences and perspectives to the Thermo Fisher family, as well as a passion for serving.\n\n**Attracting diverse talent**\n\nOur inclusive culture values the power of diverse talent, backgrounds and experiences. We embrace the unique qualities of each of our colleagues, providing them with the freedom and support to enable cutting-edge thinking that results in successful business outcomes for our customers.\n\nTo ensure we are attracting talent from diverse candidate pools, we have a dedicated team that specializes in diverse recruiting, verifying that our job advertising is inclusive and removes unconscious bias. We also partner with organizations that represent various heritage and identity groups to streamline our recruiting strategy. Our partners include renowned organizations such as the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), for which Thermo Fisher is a Board of Corporate Affiliates (BCA) partner; the Society of Women Engineers (SWE); the Society of Hispanic Engineers (SHPE); Out in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (oSTEM); and the National Black MBA Association (NBMBAA) at the national and local levels.\n\nOur talent acquisition leaders ensure we focus on building deeper relationships with diversity-focused organizations to foster understanding and sustained relationships that maximize results over time. In recruiting top talent from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, we actively target a broad range of experience levels, including recent graduates, mid-level managers and senior executives. Once onboarded, our new colleagues are supported by resources and networks that ensure they are set up for long-term success.\nTalent development\n\nAt Thermo Fisher, we are committed to the ongoing development of our colleagues. We provide on-the-job growth opportunities, facilitated development through mentorship and collaboration, and formal development through established programs and learning resources. Our learning and development strategy is based on the following principles:\n\n- **All colleagues have access to learning opportunities**\n  Regardless of role, level, location or position in the organization.\n\n- **Learning happens on the job**\n  Learning happens as part of daily interactions, particularly when engaging in new opportunities or managing challenges.\n\n- **Learning is everyone\u2019s responsibility**\n  Every colleague has access to learning opportunities, and the responsibility for their development is a partnership between the colleague, the manager and their HR partner.\n\n- **Learning is personalized**\n  Colleagues have different development needs and learning styles. To meet these, we provide development and skill-building through personalized content and varied delivery mechanisms, including our artificial intelligence (AI)-driven Learner Experience Platform (LxP).\n\n- **Learning is a journey**\n  Thermo Fisher embraces a culture of ongoing learning by providing multiple learning opportunities for colleagues. This includes formal training programs, self-paced learning resources and opportunities to learn through experiences, such as deliberate job rotations, interacting with others, access to coaches and mentors, and receiving continuous feedback.\n\n- **Learning has a social component, including through our virtual programs**\n  Colleagues have different development needs and learning styles. To meet these, we provide development and skill-building through personalized content and varied delivery mechanisms, including our LxP driven by AI.\n\n**Making strides**\n\nOur EIS is one measure of the success of our talent development strategy, and we have made improvements annually. Over the past five years, colleague feedback indicates we have made significant strides in driving transparency, awareness, access and utilization of career development resources and opportunities.\n\n- **I have good career opportunities at Thermo Fisher.**\n  Improved from 65% of survey participants in 2017 to 75% of participants in 2021\n\n- **I understand what I need to do to advance my career.**\n  Improved from 64% of survey participants in 2017 to 71% of participants in 2021\n\n---\n\n**Talent acquisition and development**\n\n- **52.0%** of positions filled by internal candidates\n- **48.3%** of global leadership hires filled internally\n- **38.7%** of global leadership hires were women\nContinuous learning and development\n\nIntensity is one of our 4i Values, characterized by the determination our colleagues apply to delivering results and their passion to excel. With colleagues at all levels so driven to achieve, it\u2019s our responsibility to invest in their potential, so they can grow with us.\n\n- **Careers in Motion:** Fundamental to our learning and development strategy is our Careers in Motion program\u2014our commitment to all colleagues that development and career pathways are open to everyone. Our Careers in Motion hub is an online destination that provides a wide range of resources for understanding the importance of development and career planning. The tools and resources we feature are designed to help colleagues build a comprehensive development roadmap as part of their career journey.\n\n- **Communication cascade:** To facilitate awareness and access to our various offerings, Thermo Fisher communicates our learning and development opportunities through regular people manager broadcast calls, broad HR communication mechanisms, Yammer communities, and direct emails to colleagues. While we encourage colleagues at every level of the organization to participate, these messages are also, importantly, reinforced with colleagues at a local level by their manager or supervisor as well as their HR partner.\n\n- **Continuous development:** Our continuous Performance Management and Development cycle is a year-round process during which all colleagues identify and track progress in line with their prioritized development goals. At the start of every year, colleagues identify both short- and long-term development goals, and over the course of the year, they have regular meetings with their manager to review those plans. This approach aims to engage and empower colleagues to take accountability for their career development in partnership with their manager. The success of our collaborative model is evidenced by EIS insights that show colleagues\u2019 understanding of how to advance their careers significantly improved over five years, from 64% in 2017 to 71% in 2021.\n\n---\n\n**Feature story**\n\n**Optimizing personalized learning experiences**\n\nA robust new learning technology, powered by AI, was launched in 2021 and delivered a tenfold increase in quality development resources available to colleagues. This content surge is balanced by a streamlined user experience that simplifies the process of accessing and organizing the material. Thermo Fisher University Plus (TFU+) is an LxP that acts as a single front door to learning. It is a gateway to resources as well as other portals, including our dedicated Learning Management System (LMS), legacy Thermo Fisher University, intranet learning hubs and third-party educational content.\n\nBuilding on a robust repository of learning and development resources, TFU+ further incorporates new content and access to thousands of articles, videos and podcasts from leading sources, including TED, Josh Bersin Academy, Big Think, CIO, Forbes and Harvard Business Review. In 2020, our learning platforms provided nearly 750 unique professional, management and leadership development resources. Through TFU+, we now offer over 8,000.\n\nWithin TFU+, colleagues set their own learning goals. From there, the user-centric interface leverages AI technology to curate a personalized content experience with recommendations tailored to the learner. As a colleague decides which resources to access, training to complete or goals to adjust, TFU+ will continuously improve and refine its recommendations to suit the specific learner.\n\nTFU+ also provides a social and collaborative learning environment that enables colleagues to engage in peer-to-peer interactions and knowledge sharing. Following beta testing, over 15,500 managers have continued to regularly use TFU+ in support of their individual learning goals and career development. They report finding the platform intuitive and engaging with content that is relevant to their learning and career development goals. In 2022, we will expand TFU+ access to all colleagues worldwide.\nLeadership and executive development\n\nAt Thermo Fisher, we develop leaders. One\u2019s ability and willingness to continuously learn is the foundation for leading with the greatest impact. Between our award-winning training programs and our newly accessible TFU+ resources, our managers can access the learning they need when they need it. In 2021, a critical business program called Leading in a Downturn was designed and delivered to executive leaders across the organization and externally recognized with the Gold Excellence Award. Our leadership and executive development offerings include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- **Management development programs** support people managers at various experience milestones, including those who aspire to manage others.\n- **Pipeline development programs** prepare leaders to take on critical roles in 12 to 18 months with customized leadership and business-specific development from internal executives.\n- **Mentorship and reverse mentorship** support colleague development journeys at all career stages.\n- **Stretch assignments** provide unique opportunities that help colleagues gain valuable experiences and close skill gaps to support their career pathway.\n- **Executive coaching** is provided through a structured program with access to a range of psychometric assessment and development tools.\n- **Role of the Leader** is designed to increase the capabilities of directors in the areas of personal agility, team effectiveness and business and financial acumen.\n- **Role of the Leader+** is a set of enhanced modules focused on key leadership topics delivered, in part, by executives from our Company leadership team, including a course led by our Chairman, President and CEO.\n- **Aspiring Manager Training** is designed for individuals contemplating managing others as part of their career aspirations.\n- **Management Essentials** is designed for new people managers to build basic management skills (targeted to those with less than 12 months of management experience).\n- **Developing Frontline Leaders** is designed for people managers typically with two or more years of management experience to develop their ability to successfully coach others.\n- **Developing Emerging Leaders** is an award-winning program that enables Thermo Fisher colleagues to strengthen their leadership brand and build connections across the Company.\n- **Pipeline development programs** that prepare candidates to step into critical roles\n  - General Manager Development Program\n  - Operations Leadership Development Program\n  - R&D Leadership Academy\n  - Quality Leadership Academy\n  - Sales Leadership Development Program\n\n2021 Corporate Social Responsibility Report thermofisher.com/csr\nTalent management\n\nWe fuel our growth strategy with integrated, differentiated talent solutions that promote a diverse workforce and elevate the colleague experience across the talent life cycle. Our talent management strategy is anchored by our core performance and succession planning processes, which are complemented by deliberate job rotations as well as formal and informal development opportunities.\n\nOur Human Resources Review processes include our talent management team meeting twice yearly with the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Operating Officer (COO), Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO), Vice President of Global Talent and additional business and functional leaders to discuss every executive in the Company, along with their respective succession and talent pipelines. Additionally, our management teams hold monthly calls with the COO, Executive Vice President (EVP) and CHRO to discuss the progress of our talent strategy and where to focus our efforts as we continue to grow.\n\nFeature story\n\nUnveiling Veiled Talent\n\nIn 2021, a talent management pilot program uncovered critical learnings for succession planning approaches and delivered measurable results in building diverse pipelines for Mission-critical roles. Designed and implemented by a cross-functional team of Thermo Fisher talent experts, business partners and PPI Business System leaders, Unveiling Veiled Talent invited 300 colleagues to opt in to any of 14 General Manager (GM) roles within a single business unit in North America. The pilot directed participating colleagues to complete specific career development actions that would help them define and achieve success aligned with the goal of becoming a GM. The development tasks and tools increased career path visibility and clearly defined success for those in the program.\n\nUnveiling Veiled Talent yielded positive results and key insights. Valuable succession dialogue was generated through robust attendance at the program launch, transparent career discussions, standing office hours and a closeout session.\n\nAfter a rigorous review and vetting process, one in five colleagues who opted in were added to succession plans for the GM role across multiple Thermo Fisher locations.\n\nIn fact, 80% of colleagues who opted in and were added to GM succession slates were women or racially and ethnically diverse people.\n\nUnveiling Veiled Talent empowered colleagues and gave them a louder voice in determining their career paths. For participants who had already been slated for future GM roles, this process helped to accelerate their trajectories. In other cases, the program elevated and developed colleagues who had never considered the GM path possible.\n\nNot only did the pilot confirm the richness of our talent, but it also helped us discover veiled talent deeper in the organization. We also increased our pipeline diversity.\nCommunities\n\nAt Thermo Fisher, our commitment to supporting the global community is a priority reflected in our Company-level goals. Our approach is two-pronged: leveraging the aspects of our business that uniquely position us to make a positive impact on society and embracing the passion of our colleagues to connect to the local communities where we live and work. We also partner with nonprofit organizations and governments to empower underserved populations and help drive more equitable outcomes through:\n\n- STEM education\n- Colleague involvement\n- Global health equity\nInvesting in STEM education\n\nEncouraging and inspiring students in the primary and secondary grade levels to engage in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) activities is a core element of our community impact strategy. Our internally developed signature STEM education programs engage students by connecting them to our colleagues. Through our Foundation for Science, we establish strategic partnerships with nonprofit organizations that enable us to scale our support of student populations historically underrepresented in the life sciences.\n\nSTEM education impact\n\n| Students reached through our STEM programs | Educators reached through our STEM programs | STEM events | Participating countries |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------|\n| 100,000+                                  | 6,600+                                    | 1,050+      | 21                     |\n\nSignature STEM education programs\n\nAs an industry leader, we believe it is our responsibility to help young people make the connection to science, ensuring a continued interest in STEM subjects and careers for future generations.\n\nWe recognize that there is a specific window of time when children are open and curious about the world around them. For this reason, our signature programs focus on generating excitement around STEM subjects for primary and secondary learners. Students are provided the opportunity to interact directly with our colleagues through hands-on and team-based activities that highlight our technologies, make connections to careers in STEM and demonstrate how our Company influences the world. Our signature STEM programs\u2014Innovation Nation, STEM Design Challenge, STEMcredible Kits and Career Connections\u2014are available to our colleagues to implement in their local communities. Although traditional in-person events were limited due to the pandemic, our colleagues continued to adapt our programs and pursue opportunities to safely engage and inspire students, increasing our impact through STEM over the prior year. For more information regarding our STEM education programs, visit our CSR webpage.\nSTEM partnerships\n\nOur partners help us deliver on our commitment to inspire a new generation of innovators through STEM education involvement. We work with nonprofit organizations to deliver top-tier STEM programming through a range of partnership models, from mobile learning to innovation labs. These efforts support students and provide colleagues with rewarding volunteer opportunities.\n\nBoys & Girls Clubs of America\n\nIn 2020, the Boys & Girls Clubs of America (BGCA) launched a digital version of the DIY STEM program on its MyFuture website, which features activity and video content showcasing Thermo Fisher technologies and careers. Through this safe, fun, mobile-friendly social platform, all 4,700+ BGCA youth clubs worldwide have access to more than 150 BGCA activities and can explore the possibilities of a future in STEM. Since the migration of DIY STEM on MyFuture, Thermo Fisher\u2019s direct impact has exceeded 15,000 completed activities.\n\nWe expanded our BGCA partnership in 2021 to create a professional development Learning Pathways program for club staff to focus on and build their STEM education skills and habits, fostering stronger STEM programming delivery to club youth. Additional Thermo Fisher funding provided grants and materials to support local clubs with STEM education programming, as well as a series of national virtual engagements where any club can tune into a live hands-on activity demonstration and youth are given the opportunity to ask questions and hear from Thermo Fisher experts.\n\nChina Women\u2019s Development Foundation\n\nBeginning in 2021, Thermo Fisher collaborated with the China Women\u2019s Development Foundation to launch our Female Scientists Program, Her Science, which aims to create an enabling environment that supports the development and innovation of Chinese female scientists. The program was created to unleash the untapped potential of female scientists and encourage them to advance their careers in pursuit of higher achievements in STEM fields.\n\nIn addition to Karen Nelson, our Chief Scientific Officer, four outstanding female scientists who are also our customers helped launch the campaign. Each of these leaders represented a different research discipline and shared the story of their remarkable journey to finding success and fulfillment in a STEM field. The campaign launch was a success, with high engagement across multiple platforms. Going forward, the Female Scientists Program will be hosted at four universities around China to hold conferences and engage with students on the importance of STEM education.\nGlobal STEM Day\n\nDemand for STEM talent is growing at a remarkable pace, while access to high-quality STEM education lags. Thermo Fisher is committed to closing the gap by connecting more youth with impactful learning experiences that will inspire and propel them into thriving STEM careers. Through Global STEM Day, we celebrate and advance STEM education with colleague volunteerism that engages budding scientists in hands-on experiments. With fun, interactive activities\u2014including creating lava lamps in Bothell, Washington; simulating volcano eruptions in Shanghai, China; building catapults in Lenexa, Kansas; and creating batteries out of produce in Bleiswijk, Netherlands\u2014students were exposed to a diverse range of scientific disciplines and technologies that span our business.\n\n\u201cI am so grateful that Thermo Fisher Scientific gives me an opportunity to reach out and educate students and the community as part of my career,\u201d said Natasha Jackson, Team Leader, Service Support, Thermo Fisher Scientific. \u201cThese students start off as kids doing a fun activity, which could potentially pique their interest and lead them into a STEM career.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we work together to spark a passion for STEM and nurture tomorrow\u2019s innovators, we advance Thermo Fisher\u2019s Mission to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Karen Nelson\nChief Scientific Officer, Global STEM Day Executive Champion, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nGlobal STEM Day highlights\n\n60+\nSTEM events\n\n2,860+\nvolunteer hours\nColleague involvement\n\nOur strategy for community involvement maximizes our global impact through engagement at the local level. This is how we create the most meaningful impact with our nonprofit partners. We foster volunteer-led Community Action Councils (CACs) at our sites around the world, resourcing and mobilizing our colleagues to connect directly with their local communities. This provides rewarding leadership and volunteer opportunities for our colleagues that also deliver Mission-aligned impact and philanthropic support in the communities where they live and work.\n\nGet Involved Day\n\nOur largest annual volunteer initiative is Get Involved Day, a day of service encouraging colleagues across the globe to give back to their communities with up to eight hours of Company-sponsored volunteer time off. Activities are coordinated locally and often include STEM education events. This year\u2019s campaign centered on the theme of environmental stewardship to reinforce the Company\u2019s ambitious commitments to reducing our carbon footprint. In addition to participating in locally developed events and joining a global litter clean-up project, our teams worldwide also deployed a newly designed, climate-themed DIY STEM education activity to primary school students. This program engages and inspires youth to reduce their impact on the environment.\n\n130+ Community Action Councils\n\n$5.1M in colleague and matching gift donations\n\n4,130+ nonprofit organizations supported through donations\n\n160+ Get Involved Day events\n\nGo the Distance to Make a Difference\n\nWith quarantine and social distancing measures broadly in place, the global launch of our charity fitness challenge promoted wellness, work-life balance, connection and virtual collaboration to unite colleagues in a friendly competition that benefitted our communities. Go the Distance to Make a Difference was a two-week campaign during which colleagues tracked walking, running and cycling distances to receive donation dollars toward charitable organizations. Participation spanned every continent where we have colleagues.\n\n46 participating countries\n\n$300K+ raised for charity\nGlobal health equity\n\nThermo Fisher\u2019s ability to cost-effectively meet urgent COVID-19 testing needs catapulted us into the global health spotlight. In 2021, we became one of the largest suppliers of qPCR COVID-19 diagnostics to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We\u2019ve served over 150 LMIC-based laboratories worldwide.\n\nWe also worked alongside global health partners, including the World Health Organization, Clinton Health Access Initiative, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, to aid target countries in their pandemic response. We extended the original warranty on 362 diagnostic instruments purchased through our Global Health Equity (GHE) channel from March 2020 to March 2021 for an additional 12 months at no charge.\n\nWhat initially started as our emergency pandemic response effort in developing countries evolved into the establishment of a Company strategy and GHE business in 2021. This group provides holistic solutions targeted specifically to customers in LMICs to enable the public health response to the pandemic and provide the opportunity to strengthen infrastructure to better manage ongoing public health concerns related to endemic infectious diseases in these countries.\n\nOver the past year, we developed our internal infrastructure and processes, establishing a global team in the functions of product management, global support services, marketing, business development, sales and commercial, and legal and regulatory to effectively meet diagnostic needs beyond COVID-19 in these markets.\n\nPublic-private partnership\n\nDuring the second major COVID-19 wave in India, we partnered with UNICEF and the Government of India to scale in-country capacity. We successfully installed 97 Thermo Scientific\u2122 KingFisher\u2122 Flex instruments for nucleic acid, protein and cell purification. Overcoming strict travel restrictions and resource limitations, our efforts enabled customers to immediately begin testing in remote areas of the country to better manage the surge. This collaboration was supplemented with a humanitarian response that supported nongovernmental organizations responding on the front lines. To read about this relief effort, please visit the feature story Responding to COVID-19 in India.\n\nBuilding local capacity\n\nTo effectively utilize critical donations, receiving entities must have the appropriate capabilities and infrastructure. At Thermo Fisher, we mobilize quickly when needed to support technical upskilling and capacity building to bridge the gap and equip frontline stakeholders for immediate impact and long-term success.\n\n\u201cThermo Fisher moved quickly to meet the emergency needs for COVID testing in LMICs, becoming one of the largest suppliers to UNICEF and other global organizations. Thermo Fisher\u2019s ability to supply and support labs in over 100 developing countries makes them a key partner for us in addressing public health needs.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Alan Staple\nVice President & Head of Global Markets Team, Clinton Health Access Initiative\nIn-kind support\n\nOur product donation program amplifies our STEM and GHE initiatives worldwide. In 2021, key in-kind donations were valued at $22 million and largely benefited the US and Asia-Pacific region.\n\n$22M in total in-kind donations\n\nThrough our collaboration with the Clinton Health Access Initiative, Thermo Fisher supported the in-kind distribution of more than 400,000 COVID-19 test kits in Vietnam, Cambodia, Senegal and Mozambique.\n\n- Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam: 270,000 tests\n- National Institute of Public Health, Cambodia: 24,000 tests\n- Ministry of Health, Senegal: 70,000 tests\n- Central de Medicamentos e Artigos M\u00e9dicos \u2013 National Institute of Health, Mozambique: 40,000 tests\n\nTo read more about our community impact strategy, please visit our CSR webpage.\n\nResponding to COVID-19 in India\n\nIn the spring of 2021, Thermo Fisher quickly responded to support our colleagues and the citizens of India as the COVID-19 virus surged throughout the country. We took a holistic approach in supporting the local response to this unprecedented health crisis.\n\nOur first priority was the well-being of our in-country colleagues. As we addressed their needs, our facility in Bengaluru also ramped up production of a COVID-19 test we had previously launched specifically for India as part of our global health equity work.\n\nTo help strengthen broader community systems, we directed more than $1 million in philanthropic support to local nongovernmental and nonprofit organizations that directly served those affected by the second wave of the virus. And because our products and expertise are our most valuable assets to the pandemic response, we provided an additional $9 million in COVID-19 testing products, personal protective equipment and other critical supplies.\n\nA special component of our humanitarian response was our collaboration with our global colleagues. In response to their compassion and eagerness to help, we established an internal India COVID Relief Fund through which colleagues could support vetted nonprofits responding on the frontlines. As a Company, we amplified their generous donations with a 200% match, contributing another $250,000 to the funds raised.\n\nFeature story\n\nUnited States\n\nThe Just Project is our US-based health equity initiative supporting Black communities disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Through this initiative, we provided comprehensive support to establish a robust and sustainable lab network that now allows over 60 HBCUs to provide students and faculty with free COVID-19 testing directly. These labs, certified in line with national quality regulatory requirements, have the potential to support evolving diagnostic needs and scientific research programs well into the future. In 2021, we extended our support of the Just Project for another school year, bringing our commitment to more than $30 million in donated diagnostic instruments, test kits and related supplies since we launched in 2020.\n\nHonduras\n\nIn 2021, the United States Agency for International Development notified us that our donation of Applied Biosystems\u2122 TaqPath\u2122 COVID-19 CE-IVD kits to Honduras was at risk of being underutilized because many of the technicians in the country\u2019s public laboratory network lacked access to quality training. We stepped in to provide in-person training and 24/7 remote support that ensured labs remained operational and empowered technicians to perform and transfer knowledge independently. As a result, over 200,000 tests were performed, and this engagement has paved the way for a deeper partnership with the public laboratory network of Honduras, establishing a collaboration that will extend beyond the pandemic.\nAt Thermo Fisher, we recognize the inextricable link between a healthy planet and healthy people. As the world leader in serving science, we support the urgent calls for action from scientists around the world to address climate change.\n\nOur approach to the environment goes hand in hand with our Mission to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. We leverage our culture of continuous improvement and the 4i Values embodied by our colleagues to identify and deliver new solutions through our operations and value chain. While working to reduce our impact on the planet, we are also actively supporting the sustainability ambitions of our customers with a focus on:\n\n- Climate\n- Product design\n- Water\n- Waste\nClimate\n\nThe world\u2019s leading scientists have sent a clear message that urgent action is needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. In 2021, we announced our commitment to becoming net-zero by 2050 and joined the Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C campaign led by the Science Based Targets initiative. This aligns our climate strategy and goals with the Paris Agreement, expanding on our existing 2030 target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% compared to 2018. To round out our approach, we also established a near-term target for our indirect Scope 3 emissions.\n\nInvesting in a high-impact plan\n\nMaking 2021 even more transformative, we enhanced strategic investments in staffing, reevaluating and resourcing our climate program to support the design and implementation of our net-zero roadmap. As this roadmap continues to develop, we are supporting a strategic mix of emissions reduction actions that will deliver a positive impact at scale. The key components of our framework include:\n\n| Transitioning away from fossil fuels and high-impact refrigerants in our operations | Sourcing renewable electricity across our operations | Engaging with our suppliers to amplify collective progress |\n|---|---|---|\n\nEnergy & emissions\n\nScope 1 and Scope 2 emissions\n\nIn 2021, we achieved a 12% reduction in absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions compared to our 2018 baseline. This progress places us ahead of schedule toward our 2030 target despite the considerable expansion of our global capacity and infrastructure throughout 2020 and 2021. Over the past year of operational growth alone, our Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon intensity equalled 16 metric tons of carbon dioxide per million USD in revenue, down from 19 in 2020 and 27 prior to the pandemic. Increased procurement of renewable electricity was the primary driver of these reductions. See the Data summary for a complete list of indicators.\n\nIn 2021, we completed energy assessments at our largest manufacturing facilities that represent 40% of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 footprint. The findings uncovered opportunities to eliminate over 80,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide, approximately 25% of our fossil fuel-related emissions. Over the coming year, several of these projects will be implemented and additional site energy assessments completed to plan our transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nRenewable electricity procurement is critical to our near-term strategy. We achieved a new record in 2021, with 22% of global electricity coming from renewable sources, a 69% increase over the prior year. More than 60 Thermo Fisher sites have now achieved 100% renewable electricity. Our approach is centered around the concept of \u201cadditionality\u201d\u2014or directly supporting the development of new renewable generation sources. We do this by adding renewable systems at our sites and leveraging long-term power purchasing agreements (PPAs) with new wind and solar facilities.\n\nAs part of our strategy, we have registered with the Energize program. Energize is a unique, sector-wide initiative aiming to increase access to renewable energy within the pharmaceutical supply chain.\n\n| Scope 1 and 2 emissions | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 2021 | 12% | 12% | 0% |\n| 2020 | 12% | 1% | 0% |\n| 2019 | 1% | 0% | 0% |\n| 2018 | 0% | 0% | 0% |\n\nBy 2030, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% from 2018 baseline\n\nBy 2027, 90% of suppliers by spend set science-based targets\n\nBy 2050, achieve net-zero emissions\nAchieving our first fossil fuel-free facility\n\nIn 2021, we announced our first fossil fuel-free manufacturing facility in Germering, Germany. Best explained by site leader Omar Castillo, \u201c[Operating without fossil fuels] is a result of many steps we took over a period of several years.\u201d\n\nOver the last decade, Omar and his team examined where they could leverage opportunities to make the facility more energy efficient and environmentally friendly. To eliminate fossil fuels entirely, they used several readily available technologies to achieve their goal, including geothermal heating and cooling, heat recovery and a rooftop solar system.\n\nLast year the electricity supply was transitioned to 100% renewables, meaning the facility now generates zero greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nFor Thermo Fisher, this achievement demonstrates that operating without fossil fuels is possible in a manufacturing setting. The work completed by the Germering team has been shared with other facilities across the globe to further accelerate the Company\u2019s plans to achieve net-zero. The Germering team has already set their sights on another goal.\n\n\u201cThe next steps involve making our products and logistics more environmentally sustainable,\u201d said Omar. This includes, for example, procurement of environmentally preferable parts for manufacturing, energy-efficient product transportation and recyclable products.\n\nCustomers not only want excellent products and service, they also want assurance that we, as their partner and supplier, are doing all we can to operate in an environmentally responsible manner.\n\nScope 3 emissions\n\nOur supply chain is our largest source of emissions, representing more than 90% of the greenhouse gas emissions generated within our value chain. With the development of a supplier engagement program for climate change, we can greatly reduce our environmental impact as a Company and sector.\n\nIn 2021, we took on a robust body of work to calculate the baseline for our Scope 3 emissions. To encourage a similar investment in reporting and emissions reduction, we have established our first near-term Scope 3 target. For suppliers that represent 90% of our Scope 3 emissions from (1) Purchased Goods and Services and (2) Upstream Transportation and Distribution, Thermo Fisher will engage them in setting climate-related, science-based targets by 2027.\n\nBased on early reporting and interactions, we were able to immediately support foundational change. By the end of 2021, over 15% of our spend was associated with suppliers that had committed to science-based targets. To read more about the actions we are taking with our suppliers, please refer to the Operations section.\nProduct design\n\nThermo Fisher is committed to designing our products with the environment in mind. By incorporating sustainability principles into the design of our greener product alternatives, we can help customers advance sustainability in the lab by minimizing the use of hazardous chemicals, decreasing waste and material consumption, and increasing energy efficiency. Read more about our sustainable product design process.\n\nEnabling our customers\u2019 environmental goals\n\n| Greener product categories | 2021: 60 | 2020: 54 | 2019: 51 | 2018: 48 |\n|---------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Products with an ACT label | 2021: 470 | 2020: 101 |\n| ENERGY STAR-certified products | 2021: 250+ | 2020: 255+ | 2019: 150+ |\n\nProduct choice\n\nOur dedication to transparency doesn\u2019t stop with our own products. The Fisher Scientific Greener Choice program makes it easy for customers to find lab products with a lower environmental impact, offering more than 6,000 qualifying products from various brands. Greener Choice products must meet four criteria, including offering one or more of the environmental attributes itemized in the US Federal Trade Commission\u2019s (FTC) Green Guides.\n\nProduct labeling\n\nWe believe it should be easy to make informed purchasing decisions. Our environmentally preferable product alternatives are labeled with a green leaf symbol on thermofisher.com, and we provide detailed substantiation for all our claims.\n\nThermo Fisher is also a leading participant in the ACT Environmental Impact Factor Label program created by the nonprofit organization My Green Lab. Emphasizing Accountability, Consistency, and Transparency, the ACT label is designed to address the needs of both scientists and procurement specialists for clear, third-party-verified information about the environmental impact of laboratory products. At the end of 2021, Thermo Fisher offered 470 products with an ACT label. Our plans to continue expanding our product labeling program will enable research, pharmaceutical and clinical laboratories to advance both innovation and their sustainability objectives.\n\nEnvironmental labeling for more informed purchasing\n\nIn 2021, we announced an expansion of our collaboration with My Green Lab to label our entire cold temperature storage portfolio with their ACT label. Cold storage is essential to enabling scientific discovery, and Thermo Fisher\u2019s freezers were among the first to be ENERGY STAR\u2122 certified. By adding the ACT label, we will further provide scientists and procurement specialists with clear, third-party verified information about the environmental impact of laboratory products. The Thermo Scientific\u2122 TSX Series ultra-low temperature (ULT) freezers and the Thermo Scientific Standard Performance ULT freezers were the Company\u2019s first cold storage solutions to be recognized with the ACT label. As of the end of 2021, more than 350 models have been labeled to support sustainable purchasing decisions.\n\n\u201cOur customers are committed to adopting more sustainable laboratory practices. We are proud of our efforts to support environmentally friendly lab management, in part, with a portfolio of equipment and consumables that have earned top scores across a range of environmental metrics.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Paul Parker\nSenior Vice President of Strategy and Corporate Development,\nThermo Fisher Scientific\nIncreasing access to our 100% recyclable paper cooler\n\nLaunched in late 2018 for cold shipments using gel packs, our 100% recyclable paper cooler was expanded in 2021 to transport select products requiring dry ice coolant. The paper cooler replaces expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam coolers that have been the preferred external packaging for cold chain shipments for decades, despite being notoriously difficult to recycle. The paper cooler is curbside recyclable and meets the thermal requirements necessary to uphold our stringent product quality standards. To date, we have delivered over 1 million shipments using the paper cooler, eliminating approximately 650,000 cubic feet of EPS foam, enough to fill 24 Olympic swimming pools.\n\nPackaging & transport\n\nPackaging design is integral to ensuring the quality and performance of our products and minimizing our environmental impact. Our goal is to design packaging and transport solutions that preserve product integrity while maximizing freight density and therefore using less fuel. Whether redesigning the packaging of individual components within kits, reducing the use of dry ice and other cold shipping methods, or transitioning to readily recyclable shipping materials, we are reducing our environmental impact and helping our customers meet their climate and waste goals.\n\nEnergy efficient\n- Gibco\u2122 Lab Armor Beads\n- Biological safety cabinets\n- Applied Biosystems\u2122 QuantStudio\u2122 7 Pro Dx Real-Time PCR System\n- Thermo Scientific\u2122 TSX and TDE Series ultra-low temperature freezers\n- Thermo Scientific centrifuges\n\nLess waste\n- Invitrogen\u2122 Qubit\u2122 Protein BR Assay Kit\n- Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 6 and 7 Pro Real-Time PCR Systems\n- Thermo Scientific\u2122 Nunc\u2122 Edge 2.0 96-Well Plates\n- Thermo Scientific\u2122 Nalgene\u2122 Sustain bottles\n\nSustainable disposal\n- Invitrogen\u2122 iBlot\u2122 2 Dry Blotting System product take-back\n- Applied Biosystems\u2122 SeqStudio\u2122 Cartridge Recycling Program\n\nLess hazardous\n- Thermo Scientific\u2122 CellInsight\u2122 CX7 LED and CX7 LZR HCS platforms\n- Thermo Scientific\u2122 Aqua-Tec\u2122 Water Preservation Cell\n- Invitrogen\u2122 Cells-to-CT\u2122 kits\n\nInnovation drives sustainability\n\nOur Mission drives our commitment to protect the planet.

At Thermo Fisher, high-quality water is vital to the goods and services we provide our customers.\n\nOur approach consists of uncoupling water usage from business growth. We leverage our PPI Business System to identify new reduction and reuse opportunities and manage our water use with a context-based perspective to understand how our use relates to the needs of the surrounding water basin.\n\nIn 2021, our water use decreased by 13% compared to the previous year. These reductions can be attributed to process improvements and optimizations at several manufacturing facilities. We continue to accelerate the uncoupling of water usage and growth, and on a revenue-adjusted basis, reduced water intensity by 28%.\n\nTo identify and manage water risks across our portfolio of sites, we transitioned to using the World Wildlife Fund\u2019s Water Risk Filter tool. We conducted a high-level screening of basin-level water risks across 227 Thermo Fisher sites, twelve of which were identified as being in a high-risk basin, representing 6% of our water usage. In 2022 we will combine this screening with a criticality assessment to determine our water risk exposure and develop steps to address these risks.\n\nCentral to our environmental sustainability approach is waste reduction. At Thermo Fisher, we are exploring business models to maximize resource efficiency and create new solutions for our customers and our own operations. Our approach also follows the waste hierarchy outlined by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) such that we prioritize source reduction followed by reuse and recycling. We are developing new strategies to integrate this hierarchy into product design, production and end-of-life disposal.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to explore new recycling options for single-use lab plastics, including repurposing these plastics into durable and highly-reusable shipping pallets.\n\nAt our sites, we promote zero waste, which means diverting at least 90% of nonhazardous Thermo Fisher waste from landfills and waste-to-energy facilities. Instead, our teams focus on reuse, recycle, and compost disposal strategies. Our Zero-waste playbook guides sites through a process of identifying all waste streams, minimizing waste generation and improving waste disposal strategies to eliminate landfilling. By the end of 2021, 24 facilities were zero-waste certified.\n| Section       | Page | Endnote No. | Note                                                                                                                                 |\n|---------------|------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Our Company   | 5    | 1           | At the time of publication of this report, our global team consisted of more than 125,700 colleagues.                                |\n| Our Company   | 5    | 2           | This is the midpoint of the conservative estimate range for the population prevalence of rare diseases.

Each greener product category consists of multiple products within a product line\u2014all of which share the same environmentally beneficial feature(s). To help make labs more environmentally sustainable, we have designed these products to minimize the use of hazardous chemicals, minimize waste and material consumption, and/or increase energy efficiency.\n\n26. Environmental data in this table covers all worldwide operations, including manufacturing facilities, warehouses, offices, commercial fleets and consolidated subsidiaries, but excluding joint ventures. The scope of environmental data presented in this report includes operations that we control. Where energy data is not available, estimations based on regional energy intensity factors are used. Where water and waste data is not available, estimations based on existing data is used.\n\n27. Spend-based analysis is currently unable to separate upstream and downstream transportation and distribution. Figures presented in upstream transportation and distribution represent both upstream and downstream emissions.\n\n28. Emissions associated with end-of-life treatment and sold products is relevant. The methodology used to determine the emissions for this category is in progress.\n\n29. Value includes Scope 1, 2 and Scope 3 (categories 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8). Emissions from other categories are already captured in the customer\u2019s Scope 1, 2 and downstream Scope 3 and therefore not included.\n\n30.

The following table is not intended to be an exhaustive list of our contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but rather provides highlights for some of the goals where we have identified a strong strategic alignment.\n\n| Sustainable Development Goals | Strategic alignment | 2021 featured contributions |\n|------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **3 Good Health and Well-being** | Our Mission is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. Our products and services are designed to contribute to the health and well-being of humanity and benefit society globally. We see particular alignment with target 3b, which supports the research and development of vaccines and medicines and provides access to affordable essential medicines and vaccines. | \u2013 Thermo Fisher is committed to accelerating the discovery of solutions that can deliver more equitable health outcomes for society. In 2021, we were among the launch partners for the Bespoke Gene Therapy Consortium. Together with the National Institutes of Health, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and industry and nonprofit partners, we are advancing the development of gene therapies to help fill the unmet medical needs of patients with rare diseases. While a single rare disease affects small numbers of people, rare diseases collectively affect an estimated 300 million people globally.  \n\u2013 Our Company is uniquely positioned to play a role in advancing global health equity. Joining forces with customers and communities, we leverage our capabilities to help remove obstacles to healthcare in line with our Mission and our commitment to serving science and society. With harmonized and equitable pricing, we have supported over 100 low- and middle-income countries and global health partners that otherwise lacked access to affordable diagnostic testing at scale.  \n\u2013 During the second major COVID-19 wave in India, we took several actions to support the local response to an unprecedented health crisis. This included partnering with UNICEF and the Government of India to scale in-country capacity. We installed 97 Thermo Scientific\u2122 KingFisher\u2122 Flex instruments for nucleic acid, protein and cell purification, and our facility in Bengaluru ramped up production of a COVID-19 test specifically for India. Through our Foundation for Science, we also provided $10 million in philanthropic and in-kind product support.  \nAdditional information on our Global Health Equity efforts is available on pages 37 and 38 of this report. |\n| **4 Quality Education** | We are helping to ignite the spark that will inspire the next generation of innovators. As an industry leader, we are committed to helping young people discover science, ensuring continued interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects for future generations. | \u2013 Our signature STEM education programs connect students and colleagues through hands-on and team-based activities that highlight our technologies, foster curiosity in STEM careers and demonstrate how our Company influences the world. To amplify our STEM impact, we continue to invest in and leverage our Foundation for Science, supporting groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields. As the world leader in serving science, one of our greatest opportunities is to help build a life sciences sector that more fully represents our diverse society.  \n\u2013 Our STEM partners help us deliver on our commitment to inspire a new generation of innovators through top-tier STEM programming that spans a range of models, from mobile learning to innovation labs. These efforts not only support students, but also provide our colleagues with rewarding volunteer opportunities. Our flagship partners include the Boys & Girls Clubs of America (BGCA) and the China Youth Development Foundation (CYDF).  \nAdditional information about our efforts in advancing STEM education is available on pages 33 through 35 of this report. |\n| Sustainable Development Goals | Strategic alignment | 2021 featured contributions |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **8 DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH** | We provide fulfilling careers across the globe, ensuring equity and opportunity for those historically underrepresented in the STEM industry specifically or the workforce generally. Our collaborative and inclusive culture helps our colleagues connect and grow as one global team. | - Across our global footprint, we take a localized approach to economic development and job creation. In 2021, Thermo Fisher was awarded a $192.5 million contract by the US Department of Defense. For this project, our Company is co-investing with the US government to build a new, state-of-the-art, energy-efficient manufacturing facility in a community in North Carolina. It will create hundreds of manufacturing, entry-level and management jobs in the region and, over time, has the potential for future expansion across a variety of high-demand product lines.  \n- Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Global Equal Employment Opportunity and Human Rights Policy are examples of the several policies that reinforce treating our colleagues with the dignity and respect they deserve. This commitment to fair and safe work experiences also extends to our suppliers\u2014through our Supplier Code of Conduct\u2014where we set expectations for them to operate with integrity and to embed good practices and responsible policies, including combating modern slavery and human trafficking.  \n- We understand that some of the brightest minds are just at the beginning of their careers, which is why we invest in meaningful early talent attraction and acquisition programs and create working opportunities for students who will become the next generation of scientists, engineers, functional business leaders and general managers. Each year, we hire over 500 colleagues in the early stages of their careers for our best-in-class programs, which include dynamic opportunities for high school and collegiate internships, co-op programs, apprenticeships, leadership development programs in nine functional areas and various full-time roles.  \nAdditional information about our talent and diversity and inclusion (D&I) practices is available on pages 22 through 28 of this report. |\n| **9 INDUSTRY, INNOVATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE** | One of the pillars of our growth strategy is high-impact innovation through which we deliver groundbreaking technologies. The depth of our capabilities and our Practical Process Improvement (PPI) Business System enable us to advance product, infrastructure and process sustainability. Through our reach, we support the capacity building of local researchers to further advance scientific discovery and effectively foster local industry. | - During 2021, we invested $1.4 billion in R&D across our businesses to deliver new technologies that are helping our customers advance their important work. For example:  \n  - In our mass spectrometry business, we extended the impact of our industry-leading Thermo Scientific\u2122 Orbitrap\u2122 platform to bring high-resolution analysis to a range of applications, including toxicology and metabolomics.  \n  - In our electron microscopy business, we introduced the Thermo Scientific\u2122 Helios 5 EXL Wafer DualBeam Scanning Electron Microscope to support the development of increasingly smaller and more complex semiconductors.  \n  - In our bioproduction business, we expanded our line of Thermo Scientific\u2122 HyPerforma\u2122 DynaDrive\u2122 Single-Use Bioreactors to support efficient single-use bioprocessing, from pilot scale all the way to commercial production.  \n  - In our genetic sciences business, we introduced our new Applied Biosystems\u2122 QuantStudio\u2122 7 Pro DX Real-Time PCR System, which enables clinical testing laboratories to advance molecular diagnostics.  \n  - In 2021, we announced collaborations with (1) Mayo Clinic to accelerate the development and adoption of more precise and personalized diagnostics for blood-based cancers; (2) University of California, San Francisco, to increase innovation in cell and gene therapy; and (3) University of California, Davis, on metabolomics research to advance precision medicine. These are just a few of our customer collaborations that are redefining what it means for industry, academic and healthcare businesses to work together to benefit patients.  \n  - In 2021, we provided in-person training and 24/7 remote support to the Honduras public laboratory network to ensure their labs remained operational while empowering their technicians to perform and transfer knowledge independently. As a result, over 200,000 tests were performed.  \nAdditional information about this engagement is available on page 38 of this report. |\n| Sustainable Development Goals | Strategic alignment | 2021 featured contributions |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **10 Reduced Inequalities**   | Our business policies and practices reflect equality and advance equity for our stakeholders. We promote diversity and inclusion by creating conditions that drive favorable economic and social outcomes for groups traditionally underrepresented within our industry and across our value chain. | \u2013 Our five-year D&I strategic plan has served as a roadmap and guided our progress since 2017. We have strengthened our culture of inclusion and enhanced our approach to further embed diversity as an essential aspect of fulfilling our Mission. From 2017, we increased US representation of women and racially and ethnically diverse colleagues.  \n\u2013 We are proud to sponsor nine global Business Resource Groups (BRGs) that represent diverse affinities within our Company. Our BRGs play a critical role in building a culture that encourages and embraces differences. By fostering inclusion and belonging, building allyship, and supporting career growth of colleagues, our BRGs collaborate with our D&I team to deliver on our business objectives and strategic imperatives. Members of our Company leadership team serve as executive sponsors for BRGs to build allyship and understanding while maximizing the success and impact of these groups.  \n\u2013 Within our communities, we continue our efforts to advance racial equity and social justice. In 2021, we committed $25 million in impact investment with minority-serving financial institutions that focus on Black communities and businesses. Supporting institutions that provide a bridge to empowering the historically disenfranchised, these investments are part of the Company\u2019s broader approach to addressing inequalities and strengthening communities through our business practices.  \nAdditional information about our efforts in advancing inclusion and reducing inequalities is available on pages 22 through 24 of this report. |\n| **13 Climate Action**         | We recognize the inextricable link between a healthy planet and healthy people. As the world leader in serving science, we support the urgent call from scientists around the world to address climate change. We are focused on protecting the planet, starting with reducing our carbon footprint. As a responsible business partner, we help our customers advance climate science and reduce the environmental impact of their own labs and operations. | \u2013 In 2021, we announced our goal to become net-zero across our value chain by 2050 and joined the Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C campaign led by the Science Based Targets initiative, aligning our goals with the Paris Agreement. This goal expands on our existing 2030 target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% compared to 2018.  \n\u2013 We established a near-term reduction target for our indirect Scope 3 emissions. We will engage suppliers representing 90% of our Scope 3 emissions from (1) Purchased Goods and Services and (2) Upstream Transportation and Distribution in setting climate-related, science-based targets by 2027.  \n\u2013 In 2021, we achieved a 12% reduction in absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions compared to our 2018 baseline and a 1% reduction compared to the prior year.  \n\u2013 We completed energy assessments at our largest manufacturing facilities that represent 40% of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 footprint.  \n\u2013 Procuring renewable electricity is important to our near-term strategy to reduce our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We achieved a new record in 2021 with 22% of global electricity coming from renewable sources, a 69% increase over the prior year.  \nAdditional information about our efforts to combat climate change is available on pages 40 and 41 of this report. |\n## Appendix 2 \u2013 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Index\n\n| GRI Standard | Disclosure | Response/Reference

In addition to regular reports, in 2021, the Committee engaged in a session dedicated to Thermo Fisher\u2019s carbon reduction strategy and key initiatives. |\n|             | Describe management\u2019s role in assessing and managing risks and opportunities.            | In 2021, we enhanced strategic investments in staffing, reevaluating and resourcing our climate program to support the design and implementation of our net-zero roadmap. We also expanded our governance model around climate to enable decision making that purposefully accelerates our climate strategy. Tiered steering committees are embedded within the organization and ladder up to the Company leadership team. Together with our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, top executives with climate, operations and finance expertise review our plans, risks and results on a quarterly basis. |\n| Strategy    | Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium, and long term. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization\u2019s businesses, strategy, and financial planning. | Our risk management process has identified short-term risks and impacts: acute physical, increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events contributing increased capital expenditures; chronic, physical changes in precipitation patterns and extreme variability in weather patterns contributing to increased risks to operations. Climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced the Company\u2019s strategy and financial planning. Thermo Fisher has made new foundational investments in infrastructure, organizational structure, systems and human capital\u2014key levers for accelerating the design and systematic implementation of our developing net-zero roadmap. We established a plan to enable a strategic mix of legitimate emissions reduction actions that will deliver positive impact at scale. In 2021, we enhanced investments in staffing, reevaluating and resourcing our climate program. In 2022, our priority is to develop climate scenario analysis processes to help the business understand the potential impact of physical and transitional risks across low-, medium- and high-case scenarios based on Representative Concentration Pathways shared by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Risk types that will be considered include current and emerging regulation, technology, legal, market risk and opportunities, reputation risk and opportunities, acute physical risk, and chronic physical risk. Climate change risks and opportunities will continue to inform the Company\u2019s strategy with regard to product and services, supply and value chain, and operations, and will continue to be incorporated into the Company\u2019s financial planning from a direct cost, capital expenditures and capital allocation standpoint. |\n| Strategy    | Describe the resilience of the organization\u2019s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2\u00b0C or lower scenario. | Climate scenario analysis will inform the resilience of our current climate strategy and help identify areas for further strengthening based on different climate-related scenarios. Thermo Fisher\u2019s short- and long-term strategies are linked to our emissions reduction targets, which are aligned with the well-below 2\u00b0C pathway. These targets align with two of the three pillars of our Company\u2019s growth strategy: developing high-impact products and enhancing our unique customer value proposition. |\n| Risk management | Describe the organization\u2019s processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks. |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                 | To inform the wider enterprise risk management process of any specific risks and opportunities posed by climate change and/or the transition to a low-carbon economy, we review insurance reports outlining flooding, wildfires and extreme weather risks for all Company sites. To manage identified risks, site-specific mitigation plans are developed. In 2021, Thermo Fisher spent $1.8 million related to these plans. |\n|                 | In 2022, our priority is to develop climate scenario analysis processes to help us understand the potential impact of physical and transitional risks across low-, medium- and high-case scenarios based on Representative Concentration Pathways shared by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. |\n|                 | Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organization\u2019s overall risk management. |\n|                 | Climate science is clear. Urgent action is needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, which Thermo Fisher has prioritized as core to our Mission and integral to our business and sustainability strategies. In 2021, we increased our climate ambition by committing to net-zero emissions across our value chain by 2050 and joining the Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C campaign led by the Science Based Targets initiative, aligning our goals with the Paris Agreement. This net-zero target builds on our near-term climate goals. |\n|                 | We are actively developing our operational roadmap to a net-zero value chain to manage climate-related risks. Key components of our plan include a transition from fossil fuels to renewable electricity, supplier engagement program and sustainable product design program to enable our customers to achieve their goals and drive innovation. As our roadmap evolves, we continue to frame our approach toward a broader range of emissions sources such as our fleet, waste generation, transportation and business travel. With insights in these areas, our colleagues and other stakeholders are critical partners in helping us achieve our goals. |\n\n| Metrics & targets | Disclose the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process. |\n|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                   | The Company has established the following metrics to measure and track the progress of our climate program: |\n|                   | - Direct and indirect emissions |\n|                   | - GHG emission intensity and allocation to customers |\n|                   | - Generation and procurement of renewable electricity |\n|                   | - Supplier engagement and performance with our EcoVadis and CDP supplier programs |\n|                   | - Suppliers committing to and setting science-based targets |\n|                   | - Number of greener products available to customers |\n|                   | - Number of products with environmental labeling |\n|                   | Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if appropriate, Scope 3 GHG emissions, and the related risks. |\n|                   | We report on our GHG emissions and progress towards near- and long-term targets in line with the GHG Protocol guidance for defining and calculating GHG footprint, which can be found in the Data summary table on pages 50 through 52 of this report. |\n|                   | Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets. |\n|                   | The Company currently has two near-term and one long-term climate target: |\n|                   | - By 2030, reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 30% from 2018 baseline |\n|                   | - By 2027, 90% of suppliers, by spend, will set science-based targets |\n|                   | - By 2050, achieve net-zero emissions |\nAppendix 5 \u2013 Material issue definitions\n\nThe table below presents how we define our priority, material issues.\n\nIn this report and other communications and statements, when we use the terms \u201cmaterial,\u201d \u201cmateriality\u201d and similar terms, we are using such terms to refer to topics that reflect Thermo Fisher\u2019s significant economic, environmental and social impacts or to refer to topics that are important to stakeholders and our business success.
