The report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and integrates the recommendations of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nIn addition to the information found in this report and on our website, we externally report on our Travel with Purpose strategy, programs and progress towards our 2030 Goals in Hilton\u2019s Form 10-K, Annual Report and Proxy Statement. We obtain third-party assurance over selected data disclosed in this report, as indicated in our 2021 Assurance Statement. All financial figures indicated in this report are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.\nThrough another year of change and challenges, what united our Hilton family was our shared purpose\u2014to fill the earth with the light and warmth of hospitality.\n\nThe pandemic made clear that our hospitality is a force for good in this world, and we are committed to making that a reality each and every day for all of our stakeholders across our 18 award-winning brands and more than 6,800 hotels. Now more than ever, it\u2019s our responsibility to preserve the destinations we call home and create truly inclusive growth in our communities. That\u2019s why we have remained committed to our Travel with Purpose strategy, and in 2021 we made exciting progress against our goals.\n\nAs we focused on our business\u2019 recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, we never lost sight of supporting our communities as they recovered too. In collaboration with our Team Members, owners, and community partners, we were the first hospitality company to sign the U.S. Department of Energy Better Climate Challenge, launched our carbon neutral meetings program to make sustainable events simple for our customers, and awarded nearly $2 million in grants through the Hilton Effect Foundation, investing in groups leading the charge in building resiliency and recovery around the world.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that our Team Members\u2014who are truly at the heart of everything we do\u2014rose to the occasion, volunteering more than 190,000 hours, and bringing to life our environmental and social programs in the thousands of communities we serve. Thanks to their tremendous dedication, I am proud to share highlights of the recognition we received for our environmental and social efforts, including being named:\n\n- A global sustainability leader on the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for the fifth consecutive year and the only hotel company to earn Gold Class distinction in S&P Global\u2019s Sustainability Yearbook.\n- DiversityInc\u2019s #1 Company for Diversity.\n- The #1 Best Big Company to Work For in the U.S. and the #3 World\u2019s Best Workplace by Great Place to Work Institute and Fortune Magazine.\n\nThere has never been a more important time to double down on our commitments and raise the bar on our environmental and social goals. In the coming year, as climate science and best practices continue to evolve, we will set more ambitious environmental targets that will help preserve the destinations where we live, work and travel, and pave the way to a net-zero future. We are also expanding our social goals, focusing on creating career opportunities, meaningfully impacting our community members, and promoting responsible, inclusive conduct across our operations.\n\nI am so proud of all that we accomplished in 2021, and even prouder of the course we are charting for the future. Together, our Hilton family is defining the next golden age of travel, anchored in sustainability and inclusivity. Thank you to all our Team Members, owners, guests and other partners around the globe who bring Travel with Purpose to life every day\u2014thanks to you, we have a truly bright future ahead.\n\nChristopher J. Nassetta\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nApril 8, 2022\nHilton At-A-Glance\n\nHilton is one of the largest and most recognized hospitality companies in the world. Since 1919, we have been an innovator in the industry, driven by the vision of our founder Conrad Hilton, \u201cto fill the earth with the light and warmth of hospitality.\u201d\n\nOur mission is to be the most hospitable company in the world\u2014by creating heartfelt experiences for guests, meaningful opportunities for Team Members, strong value for owners and positive impact in our communities.\n\nOur business model\nWe organize our operations into three distinct and separately managed operating segments:\n\n1. Our managed segment, comprising hotels that are managed by Hilton on behalf of third-party hotel owners\n2. Our franchised segment, comprising hotels owned and operated by third-party owners and management companies\n3. Our ownership segment, comprising hotels that are owned or leased by Hilton or our affiliates\n\nOur greatest asset: our Team Members\nOur Hilton Team Members are at the heart of our business. We foster a culture of inclusivity for our Team Members and are committed to offering a workplace where they can grow, thrive and reach their full potential. We define Team Members as employees at Hilton corporate offices and owned and managed properties, and employees of franchisees who work on-property at independently owned and operated hotels in the Hilton portfolio.\n\nHilton Supply Management\nOur global procurement and supply chain arm, Hilton Supply Management (HSM), develops relationships and negotiates with suppliers around the world to source goods and services at the best combination of price, quality and service. HSM works with more than 85,000 Tier 1 suppliers to source over 482,000 products for hotels around the world, servicing over 14,000 properties, including more than 6,600 non-Hilton branded hotels. Learn more at Hilton Supply Management.\nAt Hilton, we\u2019re committed to driving responsible travel and tourism globally. Our environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategy is called Travel with Purpose, and it is integrated through every aspect of our business, including our operations, our supply chain and our engagement with our communities.\nAs with everything we do, people are at the heart of our ESG programs. Our Team Members around the world bring Travel with Purpose to life with dedication, passion, and a love for their neighbors. While Hilton is a global company, our hotels are local businesses, proud to serve their communities, support livelihoods and bolster economies.\n\nOur ESG programs are built on this principle.\n\nAbout Travel with Purpose\n\nTravel with Purpose is Hilton\u2019s ESG strategy to drive responsible travel and tourism globally. Through Travel with Purpose, we seek to create positive environmental and social impact across our operations, supply chain and communities. We pursue best-in-class operational excellence and governance, engage our guests, owners and Team Members, and use our innovation and influence to make meaningful differences in the destinations and communities in which we operate.\n\nWhile social and environmental impact has long been a priority for Hilton, in 2018 we set our ambitious Travel with Purpose 2030 Goals to hold ourselves accountable for the environmental and social progress we aim to create in our business. Our 2030 Goals are underpinned by targets which closely align with the United Nation\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To achieve these goals, our hotels use LightStay, our industry-leading ESG measurement and management platform. We also leverage our numerous partners and the Hilton Effect Foundation, Hilton\u2019s primary international philanthropic arm, to invest in programs and partnerships that will drive progress on our 2030 Goals.\n\nThese best-in-class ESG programs, combined with the incredible work of our Team Members around the world to put Travel with Purpose into action, have made Hilton an industry leader in driving social and environmental impact. Yet we are continuously pushing to advance our ESG strategy and evolve our programs to do better\u2014for our guests, our communities and the world.\n\nMateriality assessment\n\nWe periodically reevaluate our programs to ensure we are aligning with the issues that matter most to our business and stakeholders. In 2020, we worked with a third party to conduct a thorough ESG materiality assessment, leveraging guidance from the GRI, SASB, and the World Economic Forum. The results of this assessment can be found in our Materiality Assessment Report.\n\nView Our 2030 Goals\n\nA pledge to travel lighter\u2014we are paving the way toward a net zero world and creating an engine of opportunity in the communities we serve around the globe.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t look at ESG in isolation or silos, but as an intrinsic part of our enduring strategy. Not only is it a top priority for our business, but it\u2019s ingrained in our culture and founding values. Creating a positive impact on the planet and our communities empowers everyone across the organization to find a deeper purpose in our daily work. Our Team Members, everywhere, are taking that to heart.\u201d\n\nKristin Campbell\nGeneral Counsel and Chief ESG Officer\nOur new ESG strategic framework\n\nIn 2021, we conducted a strategic review of our Travel with Purpose 2030 Goals to ensure that Hilton continues to evolve its ESG strategy in line with climate science and best-in-class programs.\n\nLooking to the future, we have developed a framework that will expand and deepen our commitments to our Team Members, our communities and our planet. It serves as a way to focus and communicate our efforts and will be accompanied by specific targets later this year. As climate science has continued to evolve, we have reevaluated our goals, and will reveal more ambitious environmental targets in alignment with the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) that will help preserve the destinations where we operate and set us on the path to a net-zero future. We will also announce expanded social goals that refocus us on driving meaningful impact and creating an engine of opportunity for our Team Members and community members. Finally, we formally incorporated our governance priorities into our Travel with Purpose strategy, including our work in public affairs, partnerships, and policies and reporting.\n\nHere is our path forward at a glance:\n\n- **Environmental**\n  -

We have continuously evolved and enhanced its capabilities to deliver stronger data and drive greater impact in our portfolio of properties.\n\nLightStay is a Global Brand Standard, which means both Hilton\u2019s managed and franchised hotels are required to use the platform to track their environmental and social performance, assess progress toward their goals, and learn from the actions and performance of their peers.\n\nGaining recognition\n\nLightStay is aligned with the globally recognized criteria of the UN-founded Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC), the most respected seal of approval for sustainable travel and tourism practices. In 2021, LightStay was also recognized by Google as an approved program for their initiative to label eco-certified hotels. When searching for hotels on Google, consumers can now find the green leaf beside all Hilton properties, indicating their commitment to sustainability practices.\n\n$1B+\ncumulative savings in energy costs since 2009\nby measuring and monitoring our demand-side energy management in LightStay\n\nLightStay features\n\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT TRACKING\nTracking energy and water consumption, monitoring carbon and waste generation, sourcing practices and improvement projects, and providing peer performance benchmarking.\n\nSOCIAL IMPACT TRACKING\nMeasuring the impact of volunteer activities, donations, and engagement with local partners.\n\nBEST-PRACTICE SHARING\nTracking operational, design and construction sustainability practices, and enabling hotels to share best practices across our portfolio.\n\nCONTEXT-BASED DATA\nAnalyzing and predicting utility consumption and costs through data-driven models that leverage local data, such as weather reports, and alerting hotel teams of consumption spikes in real time.\n\nRISK MITIGATION\nMapping all hotels against external risk indices including disaster, climate, water and human rights risks, to inform local strategy and priorities.\n\nENGAGEMENT TOOLS\nConnecting with our hotel teams via recognition, guidance, trainings and customized reports, including reports that can be shared with owners and clients.\n\nCLIENT REPORTING\nEnabling us to accurately measure our clients\u2019 Scope 3 emissions from meetings and events.\n\nTHIRD-PARTY VERIFIED\nExternally verified to ensure the accuracy and completeness of our data.\n\n\u201cOur ability to track progress against our ESG goals hinges on our ability to capture and report data in LightStay. This proprietary system not only measures our progress, it allows us to demonstrate real cost savings and business efficiencies from the most impactful improvement projects across our portfolio\u2014including over $1 billion in utility cost savings alone since 2009.\u201d\n\nDanny Hughes\nEVP and President, Americas\nThe power of connection\u2014bringing people together\u2014is more important than ever as businesses reconvene. That\u2019s why we created Meet with Purpose, which empowers our customers to convene sustainably and advance environmental and social impact goals. Our clients can even offset the carbon emissions of their event and volunteer to make an impact in the local community.\n\nChris Silcock\nEVP & Chief Commercial Officer\n\nIn 2021, we refreshed and relaunched our Meet with Purpose program, which allows customers to integrate social and environmental considerations into their meetings and events, to assist them in achieving their own ESG goals. Meet with Purpose offers meeting planners and travel managers a set of tools to help their attendees Gather, Nourish and Impact. For Gather, our proprietary LightStay Meeting Calculator helps guests convene in a more sustainable way, calculating the environmental profile of their stay so they can make informed, low-waste choices and obtain carbon credits to mitigate the carbon footprint of their gatherings. For Nourish, we offer climate-conscious menus featuring locally sourced and sustainably grown meals designed to boost energy and minimize leftovers, while also nourishing others in the local community by donating remaining food, where permitted. For Impact, we offer rewarding social impact opportunities important to our customers, ranging from packing hygiene kits to hosting a skills workshop for local youth, that align with the guests\u2019 own ESG goals.\n\nOur goal is to work with our customers to impact the destinations where they host business travel and meetings, leaving them better because they visited.\n\nNEW IN 2021\nCARBON NEUTRAL MEETINGS\nBy leveraging the robust, property-specific data in LightStay, we are able to offer a new Carbon Neutral Meeting/Event offering to our customers at participating hotels. In a Carbon Neutral Meeting, the CO\u2082 emissions created from the meeting activities are offset by carbon credits, which contribute to projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nLightStay\u2019s Meeting Calculator facilitates the offset of the carbon footprint of meetings by using each property\u2019s unique consumption data to create a custom report detailing the predicted carbon, energy, water and waste generated by a meeting or event. The proprietary tool helps meeting planners and guests convene in a more sustainable way, reducing the environmental profile of their stay by making informed, low-waste choices and providing options for offsetting any remaining carbon impact.\n\nWe work with our partner, South Pole, to purchase the carbon credits for our Carbon Neutral Meeting offering. These credits fund projects that are located across the globe, including nature-based climate solutions and clean energy and community projects.\nCreating a better world to travel\n\nEstablished in 2019, the Hilton Effect Foundation (HEF) is our primary international philanthropic arm that seeks to advance our ambitious Travel with Purpose 2030 goals.\n\nThe Foundation seeks to have a positive impact on the communities Hilton serves, with the mission to create a better world to travel for generations to come. HEF awards grants within three focus areas\u2014annual Hilton Effect Grants, disaster response and resiliency, and signature partnerships. In 2021, the Foundation focused on the theme of restoring our communities and our planet for future generations of travelers.\n\nAs our communities began to recover from the initial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we focused our 2021 annual Hilton Effect Grants on two key urgent needs:\n\n- Restoring opportunities for underrepresented groups and those who were disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.\n- Restoring the planet, with a focus on programs that combat climate change and drive environmental stewardship.\n\nTo advance these restoration efforts, the Hilton Effect Foundation distributed nearly $2 million in Hilton Effect Grants, a 50% increase in HEF grant awards from the prior year. These funds supported 12 grantees across six continents. An overview of the 2021 grantees can be found on the map below, and throughout this report we will acquaint you with stories of specific Hilton Effect Grantees and the important work they\u2019re doing to impact communities across the world. For more information about the grantees and their projects, visit hiltoneffect.org.\n\nSUPPORTING OUR SIGNATURE PARTNERSHIPS\n\nThe Hilton Effect Foundation also supports long-standing partnerships with organizations creating a lasting positive impact in communities and environments around the world.

Participants will even receive updates from the resort over the next one to two years, so guests can keep an eye on how their baby coral is growing and learn when they get transplanted into their natural habitat.\n\nEnvironmental Impact\n\nThrough climate action and destination stewardship, we intend to pave the way to a net-zero future for our company and the global travel and tourism industry.\nPaving the way to net zero\nReducing our environmental footprint is vital to our business and the world we love to travel.\n\nClimate change poses a critical threat to the growth and resiliency of the travel and tourism industry. We believe it is important to the long-term success of our business to build and operate sustainable, efficient hotels and to serve as good stewards of the beautiful destinations where we operate. We also aim to meet the expectations of the growing number of consumers who prioritize sustainability considerations when they travel. For these reasons, Hilton is committed to conserving the environment and working to reduce the environmental footprint of our hotels and our operations.\n\nHilton was the first major hospitality company to set science-based targets to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in line with climate science. In 2021, we evolved our strategy to set more ambitious targets guided by the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi). These targets are currently under review with the SBTi, a key body helping the global corporate world align with climate science.\n\nWe also participate in cross-sector sustainability initiatives through our collaboration in the Sustainable Hospitality Alliance, the World Travel & Tourism Council, and our status as a signatory to the U.S. Department of Energy Better Climate Challenge. We view such participation as a business imperative.\n\nTo lead our industry, we follow the data\nOur primary source of emissions comes from the operation of our hotels. In 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a significant decrease in utility consumption across our global portfolio, primarily due to reduced occupancy and complete or partial suspensions of hotel operations.\n\nDuring 2021, we began to recover from the impact of the pandemic and the majority of hotels reopened and began to build back occupancy, in some cases reaching pre-pandemic levels. As such, we experienced an increase in consumption of energy, water and waste throughout 2021 as occupancy rates increased. As the business continues to recover, we aim to remain below pre-pandemic consumption levels and to stay on track to achieve our 2030 emissions targets.\n\nThe pandemic also allowed us to collect valuable information on how we can optimize the efficiency of hotel operations in times of reduced occupancy, including partial building shutdowns, variable plant load operation, and implementation of enhanced building controls. We will use this knowledge to inform our operations going forward.\n\nBetter Climate Challenge\nIn 2021, Hilton was the first hospitality company to sign on to the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Better Climate Challenge, a national leadership initiative of organizations committed to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, creating jobs, and promoting healthy, safe and thriving communities. As a Better Climate Challenge partner, Hilton has made a public commitment to a more than 50% reduction in GHG emissions across our managed hotel operations over the next 10 years.\n\nPROVIDING SUSTAINABLE HOSPITALITY TO THE WORLD LEADERS AT COP26\nOur Glasgow hotels hosted attendees of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26, at which heads of state from around the world reported on progress since the Paris Agreement and discussed the most recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nThe Hilton Glasgow hosted a senior UN delegation and held a major two-day event attended by the CEOs of some of the world\u2019s largest businesses. Hosting this event created a great deal of attention to worthwhile sustainability projects, such as equipping refurbished rooms with technology to minimize electrical and water waste, and donating old furniture for upcycling. They also completed an installation of a state-of-the-art building management control system, which drives energy savings. The hotel took this opportunity to serve as a catalyst for the hotel\u2019s behavioral change toward sustainable practices, such as carbon offset meetings and plumbed water fountains.\nPreserving destinations\n\nHilton recognizes that we have a responsibility to conserve the environment and protect the communities in which we operate. We are taking steps to assess our biodiversity risk as well as our exposure to physical climate risks, in accordance with guidance from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nWe have mapped all of our hotels against the World Database of Protected Areas and the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s Red List of Threatened Species, and against Verisk-Maplecroft\u2019s Climate Change Vulnerability Index. We have also mapped our U.S. hotels against 100-year flood zone areas, as designated by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency. We are working to develop mitigation plans for existing properties, as well as for new developments in high-risk areas, leveraging our established human rights due diligence process.\n\nWe also work with World Wildlife Fund to identify key destinations that might be experiencing higher social and environmental stress to help us prioritize our destination stewardship efforts. In addition, we map 100% of our hotels and pipeline countries against a series of 26 risk indicators, from modern slavery to deforestation.\n\nSOUTH POLE IS HILTON\u2019S PARTNER IN THE PURCHASE OF CARBON CREDITS\n\nTake a look at some of the 2021 projects supported by Hilton\u2019s partnership with South Pole. The credits supporting these projects were purchased as part of our Carbon Neutral Meeting Program and to offset unavoidable emissions. All of the projects selected are either Gold Standard Verified Emissions Reductions or Verified Carbon Standard projects to ensure their additionality and environmental integrity.\n\nMYTRAH WIND POWER, INDIA\n\nThis wind energy project in the Indian states of Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana tackles climate change by providing a renewable source of electricity to the Indian grid. The project also benefits surrounding villages, providing employment and boosting access to education and clean water.\n\nSAFE COMMUNITY WATER SUPPLY, RWANDA\n\nLack of safe water, along with poor sanitation and hygiene, is among the greatest causes of poverty in Africa. Without access to clean drinking water, breaking the poverty cycle is incredibly difficult. The Rwanda Safe Water Project both provides local communities with clean water and reduces CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nPROFILE ON LOCATION\n\nHILTON SEYCHELLES NORTHOLME RESORT & SPA\n\nThe Hilton Seychelles Northolme Resort & Spa is a heavenly hideaway that invites guests to help protect and restore Mah\u00e9\u2019s coral marine life. The hotel\u2019s well-established coral nursery, developed in partnership with Marine Conservation Society Seychelles, helps regrow coral on land. Guests can play their own part in the restoration journey by adopting a piece of coral to track its development after leaving the hotel and snorkeling along the 650-meter coral trail to see the positive impact of this work.\n\n\u201cOur brands and hotels have a unique responsibility to preserve and protect their local communities and surrounding environments to ensure their viability for future generations of travelers.\u201d\n\nMatthew Schuyler\nChief Brand & Communications Officer\nFighting Climate Change\n\nWe believe we can achieve our energy goals through a relentless focus on energy efficiency, which will both reduce utility costs and greenhouse gas emissions from our hotels around the world.\n\nHarnessing the power of renewable energy\n\nWe began project development for a pilot to install rooftop microgrids at select Americas properties. All of our managed hotels in the U.S. are encouraged to procure at least a portion of their electricity from renewable sources through our energy procurement services contract. A third of managed hotels across EMEA, as well as our Watford and Glasgow corporate offices, are currently powered with 100% certified renewable electricity.\n\nLargest ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 certified portfolio of hotels in the world\n\nIn 2021, we officially recertified our management system for our portfolio of hotels to ISO 9001 (Quality), ISO 14001 (Environmental) and ISO 50001 (Energy), which marks 10 years of our properties certified to ISO 14001 and ISO 9001 and seven years for ISO 50001, a milestone in our long history of commitment to energy efficiency at our hotels.\n\nDesigning greener hotels\n\nIn 2021, we relaunched our refreshed Energy and Water Efficient Design Companion Guide. This guide complements Hilton\u2019s Brand Standards by offering improvements that can be made during hotel development, refurbishment and maintenance to improve the environmental performance of the hotel.\n\n2021 shows an increase in consumption against 2020 as business recovers from the impact of the pandemic; however, consumption remains below 2019 levels, and we are still on track to achieve our 2030 goals.\nHotel Marcel New Haven, Tapestry Collection by Hilton, set to open this spring, is anticipated to be the first net-zero hotel in the U.S. Originally designed by famed architect Marcel Breuer in 1967, the thoroughly updated property runs entirely independent of fossil fuel, powered onsite primarily from solar panels that cover both the hotel rooftop and parking lot. State-of-the-art retrofits of triple-glazed glass and insulation contribute to the energy efficiency.\n\nBruce Becker, visionary owner, architect and developer of the remodeled landmark, says, \u201cYou have to reuse, recycle, and reinvent existing buildings to be truly sustainable. The culture we have of tearing down and building new is really inefficient. This structure was built to last for another century. Not to repurpose it would have been a real shame. Beauty, function, sustainability: You can\u2019t have a beautiful building without addressing all three.\u201d\n\n**Modern Energy Management in a Historic Hotel**\n\n**Athenee Palace Hilton Bucharest**\n\nDating back to 1914, the Athenee Palace Hilton Bucharest has a long and storied history. However, thanks to a significant refurbishment project, the hotel\u2019s building systems are modern and efficient. In the first phase of the project, numerous improvements were implemented to improve the efficiency of the building and ensure guests have the most comfortable stay, including the installation of a new energy management system that adjusts A/C based on presence in the guest room, new energy-efficient chillers & boilers, a roof terrace hydro-insulation to reduce heating/cooling loss, and LED lighting in renovated guest rooms and corridors. Furniture that was replaced in the renovation was recycled to other hotels or retirement homes, and the old chillers were delivered to another hotel to be given a second life. The original style of the Athenee Palace Hilton Bucharest remains, but with the latest technologies and innovations for guests to stay comfortably and sustainably.\n\n**Zero-Emission Cuisine**\n\n**Conrad Washington, D.C.**\n\nTaking eco-friendly cooking to the next level, Chef Josh Murray is working fine dining wonders at Summit the Rooftop at Conrad Washington, D.C. From April to October, the inspired chef\u2014and now Director of Food and Beverage at the hotel\u2014uses a solar oven to cook mouthwatering barbecue, and features locally grown produce, including herbs grown on the rooftop garden, in his artful dishes.\n\nConrad Washington D.C. has been making eco-consciousness a priority since the hotel opened in 2019. The property received Gold LEED certification thanks to sustainable measures like an onsite stormwater management system that captures 97 percent of rainfall and use it to irrigate the hotel\u2019s outdoor terraces and to cool its air conditioning towers. The hotel also features complimentary electric vehicle chargers and in-room motion sensors that adjust a room\u2019s temperature when unoccupied.\n\n**EV Charging Stations for Guests: More than 1,400 Hotels and Counting**\n\nTo make more sustainable road trips easier than ever, Hilton launched a new website feature that allows guests driving electric vehicles (EVs) to search for hotels with EV charging stations. With more than 1,400 hotels offering stations on property, Hilton is facilitating a sustainable energy transition and has a large portfolio of hotels with EV chargers, which will continue to grow through the establishment of new partnerships with five leading EV charging providers in the U.S. In the U.K., Hilton established an EV charging partnership with the nation\u2019s largest EV network provider in 2019.\n\nAbove, EV charging stations at the Hilton McLean Tysons Corner demonstrate the hotel\u2019s commitment to sustainable transportation connectivity in the community, and are part of owner Park Hotels and Resorts\u2019 charging station program, which extends across 24 hotels, comprising 56% of their portfolio.\nDriving holistic water stewardship across our value chain\n\nWe embed water stewardship throughout our global operations. Our commitment to improving water availability and quality in all of our locations around the world requires we work closely with our hotels, our suppliers and our community partners to reduce water consumption.\n\nOur water reduction targets have proven to be more challenging to achieve than our other environmental objectives. While significant reduction in global occupancy related to the pandemic resulted in a corresponding drop in our water consumption, we recognize that we have work to do to ensure we remain on track to hit our 2030 Goals when occupancy levels return to normal. We are committed to implementing best-in-class solutions to ensure we get there.\n\nElevating operational water efficiency\n\nWe continually train our Team Members to take steps to save water, and many of our hotels in water-stressed regions also encourage our guests to join us in conserving water. Through studying consumption patterns in low-occupancy times, we have focused on further reducing water use in landscaping and building operations, and are seeking opportunities to drive water efficiency and recycling in our HVAC systems and legionella control measures.\n\nWe are committed to collective action around water stewardship, and we are proud to be an endorsing company to the CEO Water Mandate\u2019s UN Water Action Platform to fight the global water crisis.\n\nPRACTICE YOUR SWING AND SUPPORT THE LOCAL ECOSYSTEM\n\nWaldorf Astoria Ras Al Khaimah invites guests to practice their swing on the adjacent 18-hole championship golf course while helping to promote Ras Al Khaimah\u2019s marine life. The coastal driving range near the hotel offers guests the chance to hit \u2018eco golf balls\u2019 into the sea. Made of biodegradable ingredients, the balls dissolve into fish food for the local marine life.\nSungai Watch\nBali\u2019s waterway guardians, Sungai Watch, is a community river cleanup organization with a mission to protect waterways on the Indonesian island. The group is developing and testing simple trash barriers to prevent plastics from entering the ocean, as well as conducting mass cleanups of waterways. Following the cleanup, Sungai Watch documents and collects data on trash found in rivers to deepen the conversation with companies on how to use more environmentally friendly materials. The HEF grant will enable Sungai Watch to install more trash barriers to lessen the impact of plastics on the community.\n\nTo pitch in to this effort, Team Members at Conrad Bali, alongside Hilton Bali Resort, took part in an island-wide cleanup initiative which cleared more than 30 tons of plastic waste. These collaborative community engagement efforts are an example of how the Hilton Effect can be amplified around the world.\n\nWaterAid\nWaterAid transforms lives in South Africa and Tanzania by improving access to clean water, hygiene and sanitation in the world\u2019s poorest communities. In South Africa, WaterAid installed community-owned solar-powered water kiosks to serve 30,000+ people. With the support of a 2021 HEF Annual Grant, WaterAid will be able to extend their solar-powered water kiosk project to two other regions in the country. In Tanzania, our grant allows WaterAid to provide climate-resilient water, sanitation and hygiene services in the community, and increase local knowledge and skills on water resource management and hygiene behavior.\n\nClean the World\nClean the World is a social enterprise with the mission of saving millions of lives around the world by distributing recycled soap and hygiene products from more than 8,000+ hotel and resort partners to children and families. Through mobile shower units, Clean the World is providing WASH and wellness programming for individuals experiencing homelessness. During this multi-year partnership, this program will be a driving force towards a successful transition to housing, treatment and job placement services for this underserved community. Clean the World is restoring the community\u2019s access to hot showers, which directly affect individuals\u2019 health, wellness and ability to find employment.\nPreventing waste and contributing to a circular economy\n\nWaste prevention, recycling, and food upcycling and donation are all key components of creating a greener hospitality industry.\n\nOur waste reduction strategy seeks to decrease the overall amount of waste produced in our hotels, while taking steps to divert remaining waste from landfill through donation, recycling, composting, energy from waste incineration, and other opportunities. Waste is more closely linked to occupancy than energy or water, and the amount of waste produced by our hotels decreased dramatically due to the pandemic. As we look to the future, we are working with our partners, including waste haulers, suppliers and donation partners, to find innovative ways to continue that positive trend, even as occupancy rises.\n\nEnsuring that food is not wasted\n\nThe pandemic resulted in disruptions to food supply and a significant increase in global food insecurity, making fighting food waste even more of a business and moral imperative. We are committed to cutting our food waste by 50% by 2030. To achieve this ambitious target, we are driving a true culture shift in our hotels. We have deployed our comprehensive food waste reduction program to our hotels in the Americas and EMEA regions and piloted the program in Asia Pacific.\n\nOur program, which leverages the Hotel Kitchen Toolkit, guides hotels through techniques for reducing food waste in every step of the Food & Beverage process: targeting the prevention of food loss and waste before it arises through thoughtful menu planning; recovery of wholesome, otherwise wasted food for donation, where possible; and recycling of food loss and waste to other uses such as animal feed and compost. In 2021, we participated in the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s first ever Food Loss and Waste Innovation Fair as a U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champion to highlight the solutions used at our hotels.\n\nLEADING BY EXAMPLE IN THE UPCYCLING OF FOOD WASTE\n\nAccording to 2021 reports from the United Nations, more than one billion tons of food is wasted around the world each year, contributing up to 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions. One-third of food produced for human consumption is wasted globally, due to waste from the supply chain, leftover meals, expired and stale foods, blemished fruits and vegetables, and more.\n\nTaking a firm stand against food waste, Hilton\u2019s Team Members have embraced waste reduction and food upcycling strategies in creative ways, all over the world. Here are just a few examples:\n\nZERO WASTE CAFE\n\nWaldorf Astoria, Los Cabos opened Neutral, a reduced-waste cafe which uses coffee grinds to fertilize soil. Neutral focuses on providing the freshest products from local coffee communities, offering guests the opportunity to experience culture-rich traditions in a sustainable environment.\n\nPRESERVING PAPAYAS\n\nEnterprising chefs at Hilton Sukhumvit Bangkok and DoubleTree by Hilton Sukhumvit Bangkok found new ways to use fragile papayas that would otherwise have gone to waste, creating papaya jam as well as sweet-and-sour mocktails to please their guests.\n\nFINDING AN ECOFRIENDLY WAY\n\nThe Monsaraz San Diego, Tapestry Collection by Hilton is home to Westerly Public House. This restaurant has a zero-waste kitchen, utilizing fresh-grown citrus from the hotel\u2019s courtyard in the food and beverage program and repurposing used espresso grounds as a garnish for cocktails.\nReducing our use of single-use plastics\n\nPlastic pollution threatens communities, environments, and the destinations in which we operate. In 2021, we remained focused on reducing unnecessary single-use items in our hotels. In line with Hilton\u2019s Travel with Purpose 2030 Goal to reduce waste output by 50% by 2030, we are replacing single-use toiletries with full-size amenity bottles across our entire global portfolio. We expect the majority of our hotels to be miniature-free by the end of 2023.\n\nHilton\u2019s app-based Digital Key program expanded rapidly in 2021, as more guests chose to bypass the front desk and check in virtually. The technology is now available at more than 80% of Hilton\u2019s portfolio, or more than 5,600 of Hilton\u2019s more than 6,800 properties worldwide. It has been used to open more than 168 million guestroom doors and has reduced plastic waste by an estimated 125 tons.\n\nMany of our hotels around the world have implemented sustainable hydration solutions such as reusable drinking vessels, refill stations, and closed-loop bottling systems.\n\nKeeping soap where it belongs\u2014in human hands, not landfills\n\nWe are proud to have been the first hotel brand to make soap recycling a brand standard, and the first to set the commitment to send zero soap to landfill. We operate the largest soap recycling program in the hotel industry, with over 88% of our portfolio participating in soap recycling, including all hotels in the U.S. and Canada. Used soap from guest rooms is collected by our housekeeping teams and sent to our soap recycling partners, including Clean the World, Soap Aid, Soap Cycling, and Sundara, who sanitize the soap and turn it into new bars for donation.\n\nIn 2021, we recycled our soap into more than 1.6 million bars that have been donated to those in need, diverting over 175,000 pounds from landfill. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in this program becoming more important than ever before, and we are proud that our hotels around the world have continued to recycle soap\u2014keeping waste from landfill and helping those who need it most.\n\nHilton Brisbane\u2019s comprehensive waste reduction initiatives include more than 23 waste streams and community partnerships. Every stay is an opportunity to close the loop, from the recycling of oral care items and other single-use plastics, to the reduction of single-use coffee cups and single-use containers. The hotel diverts up to 10,000 items a month from landfills and funds environmental and social justice projects.\n\nHilton has collaborated on an industry-wide waste measurement methodology developed by World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Greenview, a global sustainability consulting group. The Hotel Waste Measurement Methodology provides a common approach, building on robust existing strategies to track waste and set targets, harmonizing methods of data collection, and addressing common data gaps and challenges. This gives major brands and individual properties a consistent way to set meaningful goals to reduce waste, keep it out of landfills, and track progress against those goals over time.\nOur enduring role is to foster opportunity for people, both within Hilton for our Team Members and for those in the communities, all around the world. In addition, we bring urgent focus and committed action to the pursuit of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion and to the protection of human rights.\n\nThe Hilton Buenos Aires recently launched a partnership with Vivera Organica, an urban communal garden. The garden is cared for by 14 families, and most of the producers are migrant women. Thanks to partnerships with businesses like Hilton, an improved organic vegetable garden has been opened and has provided an increase in income for the families. Guests are drawn to the hotel\u2019s dishes prepared with the locally grown herbs and vegetables.\nCreating an engine of opportunity\n\nFor more than one hundred years, Hilton has been an engine of opportunity for people and communities around the world.\n\nWe view our company as a global business that operates on a local level, building strong ties in our communities, partnering with local businesses and nonprofits, and creating a positive impact in the lives of our neighbors, through learning, career growth, and other opportunities.\n\nAs the world recovers from the pandemic, our social impact work is more important than ever, and we take great pride in supporting our communities as they emerge from the crisis.\n\nIn 2022, we will be enhancing our existing Travel with Purpose social goals to further commit to the areas where we can have the greatest impact, including supporting career opportunities, community impact, and responsible, inclusive conduct across our business.\n\nCreating an Engine of Opportunity\n\nWe are Hilton. We are Hospitality.\n\nGrounded in our founding vision of providing meaningful experiences to guests and Team Members across the globe, Our Purpose encapsulates individual moments that, one by one, fill the earth with the light and warmth of hospitality. And it\u2019s the coming together of these moments, each uniquely important, that creates something greater. Every thought, gesture and statement emanates from a single source for a single purpose. To be Brighter Together is to be connected by a common thread. We are Hilton. We are Hospitality.\nEnabling our Team Members to Thrive@Hilton\n\nWe know that when our Team Members thrive, so do our guests and our communities. That is why we are committed to providing industry-leading programs that empower Team Members to be their best selves in and outside of work, while creating meaningful personal and professional growth opportunities.\n\nInvesting in our Team Members\u2019 development\n\nWe want the time Team Members spend at work to be one of the best, most meaningful parts of their lives, and that means creating opportunities for continuous growth and development for all. Through Hilton University, our Team Members have access to over 25,000 courses covering a wide variety of topics. All Team Members have the opportunity to grow their leadership skills and careers through our Lead@Hilton framework, which develops leaders at every step of their careers and features internal leaders-teaching-leaders videos as well as content from best-in-class partners such as Cornell and Harvard. Curricula were curated for each level of experience to ensure Team Members have the foundational tools to start as learners and the coaching, mentoring, and wellness resources to grow as leaders.\n\nWe are also the first company in our industry to partner with Guild Education to provide Team Members the opportunity for debt-free continuing education opportunities. Beginning in the spring of 2022, Team Members will have access to a wide variety of educational credentials from leading universities and learning providers including high school completion, English language learning, college degrees, professional certifications, and more.\n\nA catalog of options will be designed to help Team Members move into a variety of \u201cdestination roles.\u201d What care that is convenient, accessible and affordable for our Team Members. Hilton was the first hospitality company to partner with Amazon Care, allowing eligible U.S. Team Members and their dependents to speak virtually with a clinician when it is convenient for them. If additional care is needed, they can request to have a nurse come to their home for them. If additional care is needed, they can request to have a nurse come to their home for in-person care (in select locations). This service will increase access to care, allowing for more timely treatment of acute conditions, and better management of chronic conditions.\n\nVaccine education is a key component of pandemic recovery. In 2021, we took action to ensure our Team Members had access to vaccine information, which included hosting a webinar with a panel of medical experts that was later available to re-watch on demand, and building a COVID-19 microsite to serve as a central source of information. In fact, 21% of webinar attendees said that the information made them more likely to receive their vaccination.\n\nPrioritizing health and wellness\n\nAt a time when health and well-being are at the forefront of society, we continued to innovate how we deliver care. What care that is convenient, accessible and affordable for our Team Members. Hilton was the first hospitality company to partner with Amazon Care, allowing eligible U.S. Team Members and their dependents to speak virtually with a clinician when it is convenient for them. If additional care is needed, they can request to have a nurse come to their home for in-person care (in select locations). This service will increase access to care, allowing for more timely treatment of acute conditions, and better management of chronic conditions.\n\nCOVID-19 and the many other professional, personal and social stressors of the last two years further spotlighted the importance of mental wellness. In April 2021, we launched a mental wellness platform to reduce the stigma often associated with mental health issues, equip Team Members with effective resources, and continue building a healthy culture. Through our Mental Wellness Hub, Team Members have access to a variety of resources, including over 100 leader testimonials, tips on normalizing conversations around mental health, and ways to seek clinical support if needed. We also offer free counseling sessions through our employee assistance program and through a free, dedicated counselor at our global corporate headquarters. Additionally, we partnered with Thrive Global to provide all Team Members access to their app-based experience, loaded with practical micro-steps to address mental wellness and tools to track progress.\n\n\u201cSince I started working here, I\u2019ve felt that someone believes in my skills and talent. I always felt free to test myself and put in practice what I learn every day. And this is the most important thing for me\u2014being part of a working environment that supports you and your career development.\u201d\n\nRafaela\n\n\u201cWorking at Hilton means you get opportunities you wouldn\u2019t get elsewhere\u2014to stretch and grow, try new things, and really make a difference.\u201d\n\nHumyoun\n\nFront Office Manager\n\nHilton Tashkent City, Uzbekistan\n\nMany of the programs described in this careers section are only targeted to Team Members at our owned/managed hotels and corporate offices.\n\nLaura Fuentes\n\nEVP and Chief Human Resources Officer\n\n\u201cEnabling our Team Members to Thrive@Hilton\u201d\n\nHilton 2021 ESG Report\n\nAlmost 40% of our U.S. Team Members have been with Hilton for 10+ years\n\nHilton 2021 ESG Report\n\n27\nRecognizing Team Members\n\nOur employees are at the core of our success. To show our appreciation, we celebrate and recognize them throughout the year with programs such as our annual \u201cTeam Member Appreciation Week\u201d\u2014a dedicated week to celebrate our employees around the world\u2014and \u201cCatch Me at My Best\u201d which encourages guests, managers and peers to recognize employees whose actions and attitudes embody our values.\n\nTwo of our largest recognition programs are the CEO Light & Warmth Award and the Hospitality Heroes Award\u2014both of which we expanded in 2021. The CEO Light & Warmth Award is our company\u2019s highest honor, recognizing employees who have brought the light and warmth of hospitality to life through sustained, significant and life-changing actions. New in 2021, a team award was added to recognize cross-functional teams who exhibited our Hilton values and demonstrated effective collaboration to deliver impactful results for our business. The Hospitality Heroes Award, which started in 2020 to honor frontline workers, recognizes hotel employees who go above and beyond to bring Hilton hospitality to life\u2014for guests or their Hilton teammates. In 2021, this award was expanded to also include employees at our call centers.\n\nCreating time to recharge\n\nRecognizing the importance of encouraging our Team Members to take time away last year we adapted our Thrive Sabbatical program and launched the Thrive Mini Sabbatical. Team Members were invited to tell us how the pandemic impacted them and who they would see or where they would go if given the opportunity to recharge and reconnect. We received more than 1,300 stories of perseverance, resilience and sacrifice. Fifteen Team Members were selected from around the world, each receiving a week of paid time off, seven free night stays at any of our hotels, and $3,000.\n\n\u201cIT\u2019S A WRAP ON ANOTHER PERFECT TEAM MEMBER APPRECIATION WEEK! THANK YOU TO ALL TEAM MEMBERS FOR YOUR PASSION AND COMMITMENT TO DELIVER EXCEPTIONAL GUEST EXPERIENCES AND SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER EVEN DURING THE MOST CHALLENGING TIMES. I AM PRIVILEGED TO WORK WITH SUCH A FANTASTIC TEAM!\u201d\n\nOne of Hilton\u2019s many team members participating in the TMAW fun\n\nWe also encourage our Team Members to recharge through our Go Hilton program, which offers Team Members as well as their family and friends significantly discounted hotel rates. Go Hilton gives Team Members the chance to meet fellow Team Members around the world, take dream trips that otherwise might have been out of reach, and create new memories while enjoying life-changing travel experiences. The popular travel program enables Team Members to focus on their physical, mental and emotional wellness\u2014while fueling inspiration to deliver extraordinary hospitality.\nBuilding a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace\n\nWe believe diversity makes us stronger, more innovative, and more representative of the many guests and communities we serve around the world. We are proud to create a culture where all are welcomed and celebrated. To achieve our vision of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I), we have set ambitious commitments, built accountability mechanisms into our business, established strong partnerships, and developed targeted training, hiring, and work culture development programs to cultivate diverse talent.\n\nA firm commitment to an ambitious agenda\n\nAs part of our DE&I efforts, and to encourage transparency and accountability, we are committed to creating an environment where every Team Member can thrive.

These include allyship training, our Team Member Resource Groups (TMRGs), Courageous Conversations, mentorship, and benefits that encourage diversity such as paid parental leave.\n\nElevating awareness and allyship through training\n\nA great place to work creates a sense of belonging and acceptance\u2014regardless of background, ethnicity, age, ability, gender or sexual orientation. We train for that.\n\nAll hotels and our corporate Team Members are required to complete annual training as part of Hilton\u2019s commitment to an inclusive and respectful environment for all. This includes:\n\n1. DEI/UNCONSCIOUS BIAS TRAINING to build awareness of the implicit bias all humans have and how to overcome this to create an inclusive environment for all. This includes our Hilton-designed, bespoke training program, Creating an Intentionally Inclusive Guest Experience. Training is based around hospitality scenarios, so our Team Members are best prepared to relate and apply what they\u2019ve learned.\n\n2. ANTI-TRAFFICKING TRAINING to learn the signs of human trafficking for sexual or labor exploitation and know how to take action.\n\n3. CODE OF CONDUCT TRAINING to commit to acting with our value of integrity and maintaining the highest ethical standards.\n\n4. HARASSMENT-FREE WORKPLACE TRAINING to create a positive environment for all, avoiding actions which create a hostile workplace.\n\nThis work is never done. We remain committed to listening, learning and leading to create a welcoming and hospitable experience for all Team Members and our guests.\n\n\u201cDuring Global Week of Service, our clients said our work with Courageous Conversations far outweighs any other initiatives we\u2019ve undertaken. Hilton is setting us apart and above the rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis call was extremely inspiring and motivating and I know it will lead to incredibly meaningful conversations with teammates and leaders that are long overdue.\u201d\n\nTwo of Hilton\u2019s many Team Members participating in Courageous Conversations.\nSHARING THE DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES OF OUR TEAM MEMBERS\n\nWe amplify our Team Members\u2019 voices on our careers blog and social media channels to celebrate the rich diversity of our Hilton family and the inclusive environment our Team Members are fostering around the world.\n\nBarbara, one of our deaf Team Members, taught how to sign the three most common phrases in hospitality: \u201cWelcome,\u201d \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d and \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nCreating a space to come out in the workplace, our Pride TMRG hosted a virtual conversation on inclusive language and gender pronouns.\n\nTo celebrate Hispanic Heritage month, our Hispanic/Latinx TMRG hosted a virtual discussion and live cocktail and salsa crafting class.\n\nINTERNATIONAL WOMEN IN ENGINEERING DAY\n\nEngineering Operations EMEA recognizes the annual International Women in Engineering Day on June 23rd to reinforce the value of our diverse and inclusive culture. Senior executives and hotel functional leads celebrated the inspirational stories of women working in Engineering teams across the region during local events, personal messages, and posts on social media channels. We shared our stories to inspire and motivate other women to challenge the bias and follow their dreams in the engineering profession.\nHiring a workforce that mirrors the world\n\nHilton has always strived to reflect the global communities where we live and work, and to attract the best talent in hospitality by building a culture that truly is \u201cfor all, by all.\u201d\n\nThrough partnerships with racial and social justice organizations, university scholarship programs, and our referral initiative, we have established an array of channels to reach the most exceptional candidates. We continue to expand our partnerships with Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs) and historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), as well as with multicultural, LGTBQ+ and disability-focused organizations.\n\nThese \u201cPathway Programs\u201d ensure we are attracting diverse talent. Around the world, a sampling of targeted partner and other initiatives includes:\n\n**MORRIS BROWN COLLEGE**\nPartnering with the 140-year-old HBCU in Atlanta to develop a flagged Hilton property and training complex on its campus and help build its new hospitality management program. Students gain valuable, hands-on experience at the hotel.\n\n**OPERATION: OPPORTUNITY**\nFor U.S. military veterans, was founded in 2013. We remain committed to being an employer of choice for veterans and their families through several unique initiatives\u2014to date we have hired more than 35,000 veterans and family members.\n\n**PROJECT SEARCH**\nA U.S. organization serving adults with special needs, to help them earn valuable job skills and find meaningful employment. More than 150 program graduates have obtained full-time work at our hotels.\n\n**KENYA CHILDREN\u2019S HOMES**\nPartnered on a project to bridge hiring opportunities for young adults at properties in Africa and the Middle East. This new program, part of an initiative to help place refugees in the workforce, has employed its first candidates at Hilton hotels.\n\n**JOINING THE TENT COALITION FOR AFGHAN REFUGEES**\nGuided by our founder\u2019s vision to fill the world with the light and warmth of hospitality, we are committed to using our resources and tools to help support refugees\u2014including recent Afghan refugees to the U.S. We are working with resettlement groups to offer Hilton employment opportunities to support these individuals as they build new lives in the U.S. To continue creating an inclusive workforce with refugees across the U.S. and U.K., we are partnering with the Tent Partnership for Refugees, a nonprofit organization launched in 2016 to mobilize the global business community to include refugees. Tent provides a network of major companies committed to integrating refugees in their host communities.\n\n**INVOKING FEMALE COURAGE IN SRI LANKA**\nIn 2021, we launched Hilton Liya Diriya in partnership with the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management (SLITHM) to provide opportunities for local women students who want to build a career in hospitality. The program, whose name translates to \u201cfemale courage,\u201d trains local women students in the skills they need to realize their goals. In March, the first group of participants began the program, which includes two phases: a one-month course with the SLITHM and a six-month industrial traineeship at a Hilton property in Sri Lanka.\nCreating learning and career growth opportunities for all\n\nOne of the key ways we contribute to resiliency in our communities is through opportunities for career growth and skills training.\n\nCreating opportunities in the communities around us\n\nMany of our career opportunities programs extend beyond our own Team Member community. Hilton has long been committed to providing skills training and opportunity programs for populations that are traditionally underrepresented or undersupported in the workforce, such as youth, refugees, women, minorities, persons with disabilities, and other groups. These are a few examples of initiatives Hilton supported in 2021 that helped our community members to forge their own paths to success:\n\nPASSPORT TO SUCCESS (PTS) CONCIERGE\n\nThis free online course prepares young people with the critical life skills needed to succeed in the hospitality and tourism sector. Created by the International Youth Foundation (IYF) in collaboration with the Hilton Effect Foundation, the course launched in Arabic, English, French and Spanish on International Youth Day.\n\nHELPING \u201cSQUEEGEE KIDS\u201d MOVE UP\n\nIn partnership with the Canopy by Hilton Baltimore Harbor Point, the city of Baltimore has launched an employment program pairing former \u201csqueegee kids\u201d\u2014young people who were previously cleaning windshields at intersections to earn money\u2014with jobs in the hospitality industry. The Squeegee Action Plan provides job training for 10 city youths who will work at the Canopy hotel in Baltimore\u2019s Harbor Point neighborhood, rotating among jobs as bellhops, maintenance staff, and working in the hotel\u2019s restaurant, Cindy Lou\u2019s Fish House.\n\nSHE HAS A DEAL\n\nIncreasing diversity and representation in hotel ownership has become a passion for Tracy Prigmore, owner of Hampton Inn by Hilton Waldorf. Tracy created the She Has a Deal program, which aims to educate and inspire future women hotel owners and developers in a traditionally male-dominated industry through education, networking and mentorship. Hilton is a proud sponsor of this innovative initiative and has hosted program events at our hotels over the past two years.\n\nSpringboard is enhancing employability for youth in the UK\n\nSpringboard was established to support the hospitality industry and disadvantaged young people seeking employment within it. Springboard\u2019s Employability Program identifies positive career paths, providing opportunities to experience the world of work, and increase young people\u2019s future employment prospects. They engage youth organization members across London via neighborhood community centers, where long-standing and trusted relationships with youth counselors make them ideal places for young people to get information, advice and guidance.\n\nThe Bread & Butter Project is helping asylum seekers learn job-worthy baking skills\n\nAustralia\u2019s The Bread & Butter Project trains asylum seekers and refugees in baking skills to support their resettlement and help them gain employment. Trainees undergo a 6- to 8-month apprenticeship which includes on-the-job training, English language tutoring, and job readiness support. The Bread & Butter Project then helps graduates identify work opportunities.\nAs stewards of the thousands of communities in which we operate, we leverage our broad footprint and our passionate global community of Team Members to contribute to community development and resilience.\n\nHilton has a long and proud history of prioritizing the well-being of the communities in which we operate, and we continue to expand our social initiatives. We saw an outpouring of community support from our Team Members when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and we witnessed countless acts of selfless service to support the most vulnerable populations and those severely impacted in our local communities.\n\nSupporting those around us, every day, worldwide\nThinking globally. Acting locally. Always.\n\nLocal-level support to build stronger communities\nOur Team Members around the world activate Travel with Purpose in their communities by opening their hearts and extending their hospitality beyond the walls of their hotels. Hotels lead a variety of local initiatives to meet their communities\u2019 needs, including volunteering, making donations, partnering with local organizations, and working swiftly to provide support in the wake of a disaster. Some examples include:\n\nFEEDING FAMILIES DURING COVID-19\nWhen Supoj Suwanwong, Director of Food & Beverage at the Hilton Sukhumvit Bangkok, saw that people in his community were having trouble feeding their families during the pandemic, he created a drive-through food donation center where Team Members and community members could drop off canned foods donations. Partnering with Scholars of Sustenance Thailand, a local NGO and Hilton Effect Foundation grantee, this effort evolved into weekly donations to those in need.\n\nThe Hilton London Metropole delivered 50,000 meals to those in need through Open Kitchen and Project Felix in 2021.\n\nDONATING REFURBISHED ITEMS\nRenovated items were donated to Richmond Doorways Hospital and Habitat for Humanity by the Hilton Richmond Downtown. Their towel shelves and mirrors stay out of the landfill and live to see another day.\n\nInvesting in restorative, resilient action\nIn this year of recovery, Hilton and the Hilton Effect Foundation together have doubled down on our charitable efforts to build resilient communities for future generations of travelers, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here are a few examples of these projects:\n\n2021 HOTEL ACTION IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES\n\n| Activity | Amount |\n|----------|--------|\n| Total volunteer hours from Team Members | 190,000+ |\n| Monetary gifts | $395,492 |\n| In-kind donations | $360,080 |\n| Meals donated | 123,848 |\n| Bars of soap donated | 1.6M+ |\n\nDirect Relief across the Middle East\nThis international humanitarian aid organization\u2019s mission is to improve the lives of people affected by poverty or emergencies across the greater Middle East. With programming in countries such as Afghanistan, Turkey, and Lebanon\u2014still recovering from the Beirut port explosion\u2014Direct Relief is supporting individuals and families by delivering supplies, food and other essentials. With HEF\u2019s support, Direct Relief can continue to support the ongoing economic crisis in Lebanon, which has caused an increase in food prices and a shortage of essential goods. Additionally, Direct Relief is providing essential needs of Syrian refugee children and providing aid to refugees living in more than 20 formal camps in Turkey.\n\nRise Against Hunger feeding the Philippines\nThis international hunger relief organization distributes food and life-changing aid to the world\u2019s most vulnerable, aiming to mobilize the necessary resources to end hunger by 2030. In the Philippines, its Good Food Farm project creates community organic farms in urban areas, a project dedicated to alleviating hunger through sustainable agriculture. With the support from the HEF, these urban demonstration farming projects will improve food security, address hunger and reduce malnutrition. The 4.5-hectare farm they are developing in Magdalena, Laguna, will also empower families in the community, especially the women, to earn a living through urban farming.\nResponding to disasters\n\nWith Hilton\u2019s broad global footprint around the world, when a disaster hits, there are often hotels in the community that are well-positioned to provide much-needed support. Through our Hilton Effect Foundation and strategic partnerships with organizations that are on the ground in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, we work to provide disaster relief support and rebuild so communities are more resilient.\n\nIn 2021, we responded to crises and disasters across the globe, including Winter Storm Uri, Hurricane Ida, Malaysian floods, tornadoes in Kentucky, the Afghan humanitarian crisis, and the continued impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Since 2016, we have leveraged our Team Member Assistance Fund (TMAF) to provide urgent monetary support to our Team Members impacted by disaster and hardship.\n\nTeam Rubicon: America\u2019s veterans lend a hand to Afghan refugees\n\nTeam Rubicon mobilizes veterans and other volunteers to continue their service, leveraging their skills and experience to help people prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters and humanitarian crises. Through HEF\u2019s grant, Team Rubicon continues to serve as a critical source of on-the-ground support at bases where Afghan families are being received and housed. Their role includes supporting logistics, providing translation services, and coordinating donations and gear, such as COVID-19 safety and testing equipment. They will continue to support the refugees as they exit the bases and build new lives in the U.S.\n\n\u201cEvery day we must ask ourselves how we will leave society in a better place. A focus on our people is essential to our response, especially during a pandemic. One of the many ways we supported our workforce through the pandemic was through our Team Member Assistance Fund, where we funded oxygen concentrators for COVID relief in India.\u201d\n\nAlan Watts\nPresident, Asia Pacific\nPromoting universal respect for human rights\n\nAs a business of people serving people, respecting and protecting human rights is core to our mission.\n\nOur human rights strategy is informed by the United Nations Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights. Our commitments and expectations are established in our Code of Conduct, Human Rights Principles, and Responsible Sourcing Policy, and include the prohibition of forced labor, bonded labor, child labor, slave labor, human trafficking, and recruitment fees. Our policies also prohibit the use of any Hilton property, product or service in any manner that supports or enables any form of abuse or exploitation. In 2021, we updated our Human Rights Policy.\n\nWe have created and piloted a human rights due diligence process for our operations and supply chain, and partner with suppliers to prevent forced labor or trafficking. We encourage all Team Members to report potential human rights issues and signs of trafficking, directly to hotel management or anonymously through the Hilton Hotline.\n\nCombatting labor exploitation in our supply chain\n\nOur Responsible Sourcing Policy, which was refreshed in 2021, outlines Human Rights standards expected of Hilton suppliers. Suppliers are encouraged to have appropriate management systems in place and take steps to comply with this policy. We implemented a Human Rights due diligence process, supplemented by the use of EcoVadis scorecards, to further inform our risk assessments and ensure we partner with responsible suppliers. In 2021, we continued to advance our partnership with EcoVadis to assess our suppliers\u2019 sustainability risk and performance, educate on material impacts and provide best management practices to encourage continuous improvement. All suppliers are encouraged to observe and abide by Hilton\u2019s Responsible Sourcing Policy, which is included in all property contracts.\n\nAddressing risks in our operations\n\nWe recognize that hotels around the world are at risk of being used by traffickers for commercial sexual exploitation. To mitigate this risk, we are focused on educating stakeholders, maintaining updated policies, and collaborating with leading organizations. Since 2011, we have remained proud signatories to the ECPAT Tourism Child-Protection Code of Conduct, and all our hotel-based Team Members are required to complete ECPAT\u2019s anti-human trafficking training on an annual basis. Additionally, we sponsor ECPAT via their Partners in Protection program at the Leader in Protection Level. We continuously map all our operating hotels and partners to identify and mitigate modern slavery risks, and we partner with responsible suppliers. In 2021, we partner with responsible suppliers. In 2021, we partnered with leading organizations. Since 2011, we have remained proud signatories to the ECPAT Tourism Child-Protection Code of Conduct, and all our hotel-based Team Members are required to complete ECPAT\u2019s anti\u2013human trafficking training on an annual basis.

Additionally, we sponsor ECPAT via their Partners in Protection program at the Leader in Protection Level.\n\nIt\u2019s a Penalty campaigns continue to educate and inspire action\n\nBuilding on our partnership for the 2021 Super Bowl in Tampa, we partnered with It\u2019s a Penalty for the Super Bowl LV in Los Angeles to educate our Team Members and guests at all of our hotels in the greater Los Angeles area on recognizing and reporting human trafficking. We also participated in the It\u2019s a Penalty launch event in advance of the Super Bowl to discuss how the hospitality industry can further our leadership on ending abuse, exploitation, and trafficking. We continue to support activations around other major sporting events globally.\n\nFighting Unconscious Bias with Real-World Scenarios\n\nAs part of our human rights agenda, we provide mandatory unconscious bias training for all guest-facing Team Members. Through this online training, they experience realistic scenarios in which guests may be subjected to unconscious bias based on their race, gender, religion, ability, or sexual orientation. The training includes de-escalation skills to help Team Members handle conflicts. Guided by thoughtful questions and real-life situations, they examine how guests feel when subjected to unconscious bias and how they can ensure all guests feel welcome. In 2021, training on Diversity & Inclusion/Unconscious Bias and creating a Harassment-Free Workplace was completed by 94% of managed hotels in the U.S., as well as 80% of managed hotels globally.\nAdvancing responsible sourcing\n\nWith operations spanning 122 countries and territories, we recognize the immense economic, environmental and social impact we have through our supply chain.\n\nHilton has committed to sustainably source meat, poultry, produce, seafood and cotton, and to collaborate with our suppliers to achieve strict responsible sourcing goals by 2030. We engage closely with our suppliers and encourage our business partners to adopt their own sustainable practices, including setting carbon reduction targets and conducting human rights due diligence. In 2021, we continued to advance our partnership with EcoVadis to assess our suppliers\u2019 sustainability risk and performance. All suppliers are required to observe and abide by Hilton\u2019s Responsible Sourcing Policy, which is included in all supplier contracts.\n\nA sea change in seafood procurement\n\nExcessive fishing has begun to outpace reproduction within marine ecosystems, posing a serious challenge for the international community. Despite a challenging year of supply chain issues, Hilton continues to make incremental progress towards the goal of sourcing at least 25% of its total global seafood volume for managed properties from Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) fisheries and Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) farms. This includes banning the procurement of endangered species and ensuring the remaining portion of our seafood is working towards certification, sustainable improvement, or inclusion on WWF green lists.\n\nSeveral exciting milestones were reached in our responsible sourcing journey. Hilton inked a Memorandum of Understanding with Seafood Legacy and UMITO Partners to procure more sustainable seafood for our properties in Japan and Korea, while Conrad Seoul and Hilton Tokyo Bay achieved MSC and ASC Chain of Custody certifications\u2014the first hotel in Korea and the first Hilton hotel in Japan, respectively, to do so. MSC- and ASC-certified seafood procurement in Japan and Korea also surpassed 25% in the month of December 2021\u2014a marked improvement on less than 1% in 2018.\n\nProtecting animal welfare\n\nHilton strives to work towards the legal, ethical, humane treatment of animals across our value chain. Our approach to animal welfare is informed by the \u2018Five Freedoms\u2019 of care and codified in our Animal Welfare Statement. We are signatories to the World Travel & Tourism Council\u2019s Declaration on Illegal Trade in Wildlife, committing to not knowingly purchase, use or facilitate the sale of illegally harvested wildlife products.\n\nIn addition to our efforts around sustainable seafood, Hilton Supply Management (HSM) is also investing in sustainably sourced meat, poultry, produce, cotton, and cage-free eggs for thousands of hotels around the globe. Utilizing our supplier relationships and procurement strategy to protect our planet and its animals, our HSM teams are helping properties worldwide to deliver dining experiences using responsibly sourced regional and local resources. From wild Georgia shrimp in Savannah to tofu pudding in Hong Kong, we strive to serve fresh, delicious and eco-friendly fare to guests today while we work to secure a sustainable future, continuing to obtain guidance from NGOs and other external experts as we progress towards our goals.\n\nHilton signed a Memorandum of Understanding for a collaborative partnership for sustainable seafood with Seafood Legacy Co., Ltd., and UMITO Partners Inc. in Japan.\n\nCulinary cup challenge with sustainable seafood dishes at Hilton Japan.\n\nExtending Our Stay video series traveled to Peru to meet with The Mountain Institute in an exploration of the mountain communities that depend on the ecosystem, farming and cattle raising.\n\n\u201cOur partnerships with environmentally responsible businesses help redefine what hospitality means on a global scale. Throughout the pandemic and its supply chain disruptions, we continue to see a strong demand for locally curated and sustainably sourced products. In partnership with our suppliers, we continue to deliver quality products on time while significantly reducing our carbon footprint.\u201d\n\nAnu Saxena\nSenior Vice President, and Global Head, Hilton Supply Management\nFostering supplier diversity\n\nWe have a responsibility to promote inclusion, support and respect in a world that is incredibly diverse. We\u2019ve developed an industry-leading Supplier Diversity Program that plays a large role in that commitment, helping us partner with suppliers whose culture and values align with our own. For the past decade, we\u2019ve cultivated relationships with nearly 5,000 women-, minority-, veteran-, LGBTQ+, and disabled-owned, as well as disadvantaged, small businesses. Our annual supplier spend with these businesses has reached about $220 million. Learn more about our Supplier Diversity Program on our Supplier Diversity site.\n\nWe travel to see a world that is bigger than ourselves and to understand cultures that are different from our own. Increasing our commitment to diverse suppliers not only helps us be more representative of our community, it also helps Hilton be more representative of the world at large.\n\nIN 2021 WE SOURCED FROM MORE THAN 2,500 Supplier Diversity Program partners accounting for $220M of our supplier spend\n\nHilton Supply Management, our global procurement arm, won a 2021 World Sustainability Leaders Award in the Human Rights category.\n\nTAPPING LOCAL ENERGIES TO WORK TOWARD GLOBAL GOALS\n\nOur hotels can have a powerful impact in their communities by sourcing products locally, empowering local artisans, farmers, and small businesses while enhancing the experience for their guests. Hotels may commission artwork from local artisans in their lobby, procure food & beverage ingredients from local farms or fisheries, or feature local products in hotel shops. Here are a few examples of local sourcing at our hotels:\n\nLEADING THE FARM-TO-TABLE EXPERIENCE\n\nConrad Koh Samui launched the inspirational Iris Farm in the midst of the health pandemic to provide a wide range of organic herbs and vegetables for the hotel\u2019s bars and restaurants. They produce 1,200 kg of food per month, and they process around 3,400 kg of compostable waste per month. This benefits the environment by recycling organic resources while conserving landfill space. In addition, the hotel also practices eco-friendly farming techniques and offers meaningful guest engagement activities for young and seasoned travelers.\n\nEMBRACING TRADITION AT THE CONRAD SPA TULUM\n\nThe spa at the new Conrad Tulum Riviera Maya is committed to celebrating the culture and art of Mexican traditions. The treatments are influenced by the Mayan culture, and many of the eco-friendly spa products are locally sourced. The spa garden offers a traditional Mexican dispensary of local herbs and roots to customize the massage oils and scrubs, and the spa boutique features products handcrafted by artisans using traditional techniques, including kaftans woven by Oaxacan artisans and bags produced by Yucatan women using the agave natural fiber \u2018henequen\u2019.\n\nFPO\n\nConrad Seoul became the first hotel in South Korea to gain MSC and ASC certification in March 2021.\n\nExtending Our Stay video series traveled to Portland, Oregon to explore the importance of knowing where our food comes from.\n\nCONRAD KOH SAMUI\n\nCONRAD TULUM RIVIERA MAYA\n\nWATCH \u201cExtending Our Stay\u201d video series\n\nEating & Drinking More Sustainably\n\nHilton Supply Management, our global procurement arm, won a 2021 World Sustainability Leaders Award in the Human Rights category.\n\nCONDUCT\nGovernance\n\nGovernance is the stabilizing force that strengthens the core of our business. Cascading from our Board and executive leadership, we are committed to best-in-class governance practices, ensuring we operate with accountability, integrity and transparency in everything we do. To sustain our long-term commitments, including making an environmental and social impact, we recognize it is critical to integrate ESG factors into the way we do business.\nAdvancing and measuring our goals\n\nOur ESG efforts are supported by a robust corporate governance structure, designed to enhance the longevity of our business, and ensure our objectives are fully embedded in our priorities as we work toward our overall business objectives, including our 2030 environmental and social impact goals. We have also enhanced our measurement systems so we can track progress towards our goals and use that data to assess risk and drive decision making.\n\nBoard composition and independence\n\nOur Board oversees our company and conducts its business through meetings and its three standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating & ESG Committee. Our Board has a majority (78%) of independent directors, and all of our Board\u2019s committees are fully independent. The only executive member of our Board is our CEO Christopher J. Nassetta.\n\nOur Board\u2019s lead independent director serves as a liaison between the CEO and independent and non-management directors, including advising as to the scope and production of Board materials, managing our Board\u2019s self-evaluation process, providing input on meeting agendas, chairing executive sessions of independent directors, monitoring communications between stockholders and our Board, and consulting on corporate governance matters.\n\nThe Board conducts annual self-evaluations to determine whether it and its committees are functioning effectively as required by applicable law and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The Board also periodically considers the mix of skills and experience that directors bring to the Board to assess whether the Board has the necessary tools to perform its oversight function effectively. Each committee conducts an annual self-evaluation that compares the performance of the committee with the requirements of its written charter, and the committees report the results of these assessments to the Board.\n\nFurther information on our Board composition can be found in the Governance section of our 2022 Proxy Statement and in our Corporate Governance Guidelines.\n\n\u201cESG has become a business imperative that empowers companies to mitigate risk and create long term value. This requires a strategic approach with accountability through measurement and reporting\u2014as Travel with Purpose demonstrates\u2014which is critical to ensure ESG programs are held to the highest standards.\u201d\n\nElizabeth A.

We work closely with these groups to exercise industry leadership, shape public policies that advance our agenda, and lobby for legislation and regulation that supports our Travel with Purpose goals.\n\nHilton and our association partners monitor global legislative and regulatory issues related to ESG. In 2021, we participated in advocacy efforts to advance legislation related to ESG topics such as anti-human trafficking, immigration and visa reform, plastics elimination, skills training and apprenticeship programs and DE&I.\n\nThroughout 2021, we continued to engage with our industry trade partners on COVID-19 relief and recovery efforts. This included advocating for our owners and Team Members on topics such as the Paycheck Protection Program and other forms of liquidity for the industry, tax incentives and destination marketing funds to jumpstart travel and tourism and bring back hospitality jobs.\n\nIn 2021, Hilton paid $154,719 in dues associated with lobbying in the U.S. to the trade associations in the below table. All payments are publicly disclosed, along with political activity, on Hilton\u2019s Investor Relations website and updated semiannually.\n\nHilton\u2019s President and CEO currently serves on the U.S. Travel and Tourism Advisory Board advising the Secretary of Commerce on government policies and programs that impact the U.S. travel and tourism industry, including the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHilton also engages globally with our industry\u2019s trade associations, including as a member of the Hotel Association of Canada, UKHospitality, and the World Travel & Tourism Council, for which Hilton\u2019s President and CEO served as Chairman.\n\nHilton was named a Trendsetter in the 2021 CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability, a recognition reserved for companies that score 90 points or higher on the index. Released annually by the Center for Political Accountability (CPA) and the Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, the index measures political disclosure and accountability policies and practices for election-related spending by S&P 500 companies, including political spending policies and board oversight.\n\n\u201cAs the ESG legislative and regulatory landscape continues to rapidly evolve, we remain steadfast in our commitment to advocate for public policies that advance our Travel with Purpose goals, support our Team Members and our communities, and protect the planet.\u201d\n\nErica Gordon\nSVP and Global Head of Public Affairs & ESG\n\n| TRADE ASSOCIATION | PUBLIC POLICY PRIORITIES IN THE U.S. |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| AMERICAN HOTEL & LODGING ASSOCIATION | Advocates for policies in support of the U.S. lodging industry including workforce and labor, online consumer protections, travel promotion, anti-human-trafficking, and tax reform.

We are committed to pursuing the most responsible business practices, acting with integrity, and managing risk, with appropriate Board oversight.\n\nA culture of integrity\n\nOur ethics and compliance program underpins our entire organization. Our Code of Conduct is applicable to all Team Members, officers and directors of Hilton, and to the Team Members of all hotels owned, operated or managed by Hilton. Our Code is intended to define our responsibilities to our stakeholders and guide our decision-making. All Team Members must complete training on the Code of Conduct and must adhere to following its principles and policies.\n\nTeam Members are expected to report suspected misconduct and are encouraged to do so through the Hilton Hotline, available online and by telephone 24/7. The Hotline is run by an independent company. Team Members are able to report concerns anonymously unless otherwise required by law. Hilton takes steps to protect the confidentiality of anyone who makes a good faith report of an actual or suspected violation to the extent reasonably possible. Any alleged failures to comply with the Code of Conduct are investigated and disciplinary action is taken as appropriate, if and when appropriate.\n\nAnti-corruption and bribery\n\nOur Code of Conduct explicitly prohibits bribery and corruption, and our Anti-Corruption Policy provides our Team Members with additional detailed guidance regarding the requirements of anti-bribery laws applicable to Hilton, bribery risk areas specific to Hilton business activities, and the responsibilities of Team Members to prevent and report potential bribery. Our Group Finance, Legal Compliance, Internal Audit, and Risk functions oversee compliance with our anti-corruption and bribery standards, including monitoring and investigating Hilton Hotline matters. Additionally, risk-based Internal Audits and other related governance activities are performed at hotels and corporate offices in the U.S., Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Additionally, we conduct background checks on all prospective partners.\n\nAll Corporate Team Members, General Managers and senior Team Members are expected to actively support anti-corruption policies and practices at corporate offices and properties globally. Certifications of compliance with the Code of Conduct are obtained from all locations annually.\n\nEvaluating and managing risk across our business\n\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for risk oversight, which includes understanding (1) material risks, (2) management steps to address these risks, and (3) appropriate levels of risk for our company. As part of regular Board and committee meetings, the Board of Directors is responsible for general oversight of Executives\u2019 management of risks relevant to Hilton.\n\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its risk oversight responsibilities by regularly reviewing our accounting, reporting and financial practices, including the integrity of our financial statements, the oversight of administrative and financial controls, our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and our enterprise risk management program. Our Chief Accounting & Risk Officer updates the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis and the full Board on an annual basis and as needed.\n\nThe Compensation Committee assists the Board by overseeing and evaluating risks related to compensation structure and programs, including the formulation, administration, and regulatory compliance with respect to compensation matters, and coordinating, along with the Board\u2019s Chair, succession planning discussions.\n\nThe Nominating & ESG Committee assists the Board by overseeing and evaluating programs and risks associated with Board organization, membership and structure, corporate governance, and ESG matters.

We engage with third parties to conduct periodic assessments on Hilton\u2019s cybersecurity at both the corporate and property level, and to perform on-site breach simulation exercises. We also undergo audits to ensure our technology environment remains aligned with the ISO 27001 security control requirements.\n\nAs a service provider and merchant under the Payment Card Industry\u2019s (PCI) Data Security Standards (DSS), we undergo an annual comprehensive third-party audit to process billions of dollars in credit card payments. Additionally, the Audit Committee assists the Board in monitoring cybersecurity risk by receiving quarterly reports from our Technology team that cover, among other things, our information security framework, threat assessment, response readiness, and training efforts.\n\nEvaluating ESG-related risks\nTo evaluate ESG-related risks, we map 100% of our hotels and pipeline countries against a series of external environmental and social risk indices that are updated at least annually. Information from these external indices is embedded in LightStay to help every hotel understand the key priority areas in its local operating environment and community.\n\nMaterial ESG risks, including risks related to climate change, environmental impact, social impact, human rights, and ethics, fraud and corruption are integrated in Hilton\u2019s Enterprise Risk Management System. Questions on those issues are fully embedded in our internal Global Enterprise Risk Survey, which is distributed to more than 270 Hilton leaders. The survey results are shared with the Executive Committee, Board of Directors, and Audit Committee to inform enterprise-wide strategic planning. Health and safety risks are managed through a global team, supported by tools and systems utilized across all managed hotels and corporate offices, and made available to franchised properties.\n\nMitigating risk in our supply chain\nHilton is committed to promoting and protecting human rights across our supply chain and in countries where we operate. Hilton has developed and piloted an ESG and human rights due diligence program to encourage vendors to meet Hilton\u2019s standards and maintain those standards during the contract term.

Our 2021 energy data has been externally assured, as noted in our 2021 Assurance Statement. |\n| 302-3            | Energy Intensity | In 2021, our energy use intensity was 0.2396 megawatt hours per square meter, representing an annual increase of 8% per square meter across the Hilton global portfolio of owned, managed and franchised hotels. In 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a significant decrease in utility consumption across our global portfolio, primarily as a result of reduced occupancy and the complete or partial suspensions of hotel operations. During 2021, we began to recover from the negative impacts of the pandemic and, while some hotels were suspended for some period of time during the year, the majority of hotels that had suspended operations for some time during 2020 were reopened before or during 2021. As such, we experienced a year-over-year increase in consumption of energy, water and waste in 2021 as occupancy rates increased. However, consumption remained below 2019 levels, and we remain on track to achieve our 2030 Goals. As we implement ongoing efforts to optimize efficiency at our hotels, we are making significant efforts to support our hotels to keep consumption below pre-pandemic levels.

For the purposes of this report, data listed in Tables 1-2 is considered environmental data, and the data in Table 3 is considered social impact data.\n\nThe environmental data is based on utility data input by over 6,000 managed and franchised properties into LightStay, Hilton\u2019s corporate responsibility platform. Launched in 2009, LightStay was created to track sustainability performance across Hilton\u2019s global portfolio and to help drive adoption of best practices that reduce environmental impacts. Hilton works closely with ei3, its technology partner and system host, to continually improve the LightStay system features for its hotels, owners, and management teams.\n\nAs a global brand standard, all managed and franchised hotels must utilize LightStay to provide their environmental and social impact data to Hilton. The current brand standard requires that hotels input the following data into LightStay on a monthly basis:\n\n- Energy consumed from all energy sources (electricity, gas, steam, chilled water, other).\n- Water consumed from all sources, including municipal water supply and other sources.\n- Waste disposal including landfilled and diverted waste streams (recycled, organic, other).\n- All applicable volunteering events and donations including food donations, bath amenities, linens, FF&E, etc.\n- As a brand standard, all hotels must also set annual reduction goals and maintain active energy, water and waste improvement projects.\n\nHilton tracks and supports hotel compliance with the LightStay brand standards globally through the use of LightStay compliance alerts, monthly compliance reports, and direct communications with the Regional Property Operations and Brand Performance teams.\n\nThe LightStay system supports the input of accurate data and accommodates the needs of hotels globally through a variety of features:\n\n- Global conversions: LightStay enables hotels to enter data in a variety of consumption units, consistent with their utility bill, and provides the flexibility to enter costs in local currency.\n- Property variables: LightStay automatically populates weather and room occupancy on a monthly basis. Floor area and other key details are included in the Property Profile, which all properties are required to complete as a brand standard.\n- Greenhouse gas calculations: Hilton utilizes The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) Historical emissions factors for electricity, natural gas and other energy sources are stored in LightStay and used to calculate the hotel\u2019s Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. Location-based electricity CO2e emissions factors are updated annually in LightStay for the current calendar, based on the most recent and accurate source data available for the country or subregion.\n- Compliance Alerts: The LightStay system generates monthly alerts for incomplete or out-of-range consumption values. Hotels have 60 days to enter their utility bills or they will receive an alert message in LightStay. Hotels must address all outstanding alerts within 30 days to remain in compliance with the brand standards.\n- LightStay Training: All new hotels must complete an online LightStay training course through Hilton University within three months of opening. Advanced courses are available and LightStay offers extensive user guidance and how-to-guides.\n\n- LightStay Support: Hotels are encouraged to contact the LightStay Support team to help understand their alerts and correct any data input errors. LightStay Support attempts to contact hotels directly to resolve major data issues and may also correct obvious decimal or unit errors, with notification sent to the hotel.\n\nSince 2010, hotel utility data in LightStay has been used for Hilton\u2019s external reporting of energy, emissions, water, and waste impacts. Hilton and its consultants have followed a consistent methodology, adapted to meet the company\u2019s Travel with Purpose goals and corporate responsibility reporting requirements.\n\nConsistent with Hilton\u2019s 2030 Travel with Purpose goals, Hilton measures and reports annual sustainability performance using the floor area intensity metric (consumption per square meter of total gross building area).\n\nReporting Scopes:\n\nScope 1 includes all onsite GHG emissions from fuel use, almost exclusively natural gas for comfort heating and hot water generation.\n\nScope 2 includes all grid electricity used by Hilton\u2019s managed hotel properties. The individual hotel CO2e emissions factors for the reference group were verified based on the emissions source data provided by country or subregion (i.e., US eGRID, DEPRA, IEA).\n\nScope 3 includes all emissions resulting from both onsite emissions and grid electricity at the Franchised hotels, as well as emissions relating to Managed hotel landfilled waste and Corporate business travel. Again, CO2e emissions factors were verified for different countries and subregions based on international standard data.\nRisk Evaluation\nSufficiency, Appropriateness, and Material misstatement\n\nThe sufficiency of data and the appropriateness of both the automated LightStay and final corporate analysis were evaluated for sufficiency, appropriateness, and risk of material misstatement based on analysis methodology.\n\nSufficiency Risk. Due to the large percentage of reporting properties and the large property pool (5818 Franchised properties and 878 Managed properties), the Risk of data insufficiency was determined to be Low. Annual sustainability results are based on an evaluation of year-over-year results for a reference group of properties with data verified complete and accurate for aggregated reporting purposes. The reference group for 2021 included 92% of total managed properties, and analysis of the reference group\u2019s performance supplied the average values (by region) used to complete and correct the data from the remaining properties. Data gathered using the LightStay system has been verified at the site level by DEKRA site sampling, included in Hilton\u2019s ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and ISO 50001 site visits. Data anomalies are analyzed at the site level and corrective actions are implemented.\n\nAppropriateness Risk. The automated calculations in LightStay (floor area normalization) have been verified for this and all previous reporting cycles and no errors have been found. Hence, the Risk of inappropriate analysis in the LightStay system was determined to be Low. Data, once it is reported into LightStay, is also analyzed at the corporate level annually for anomalies and missing data, and properties are excluded from the reference group.\n\nMateriality Risk. Risk of material misstatement was determined to be Low. The final analysis by Hilton staff consisted of spreadsheet review and identification of anomalies. There were 38 anomalies at the property level identified (4% anomaly rate), which have been added to the sampling plan for internal and external audit in 2022. Anomalies also include any issues with water use reporting. Materiality of the chosen methodology was verified by taking the final result for all properties not in the anomalous group, using their unmodified (raw) data, and comparing it to the final result for all properties with all normalization factors active. The raw data showed an intensity of 71 kbtu/sf, while the final data showed an intensity of 71.2 kbtu/sf. Variance was a mere 0.3%, well within the 5% variance limit.\n\nOther Environmental Claims\nWater and waste data were both reported into LightStay using the same platform as the energy and greenhouse gas data reviewed above. During the data cleansing process, the properties\u2019 water use and waste stream data was evaluated, consistent with the criteria regarding missing and anomalous data above, to determine the reference group and to estimate impacts by excluded and new hotels. Water anomalies were added to the audited group (see Materiality Risk above).\n\nSocial Impact Data. Properties report volunteer events and participation through LightStay. The summary report of the volunteer hours was reviewed. Numeric outliers were identified and the specific entries within LightStay were reviewed. No discrepancies were noted.\n\nHilton provides Hilton Effect Grants through the Hilton Effect Foundation to properties requesting funds for social or environmental projects. The amount transferred from Hilton in 2021 was confirmed by a representative from the Hilton corporate accounting department.\n\nHilton has assigned Anti-Trafficking Training Courses to all properties through Hilton University. Records from Hilton University were reviewed.\n\nHilton\u2019s Supplier Diversity Program currently includes 2,508 diverse suppliers. Supplier information is reviewed by two separate third party processes.\n\nATTESTED BY\n\nDEKRA Certification Inc. is a Management System certification company that has provided independent validation services to Hilton since 2010.
