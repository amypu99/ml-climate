Our purpose is to create more joyful lives through better health.\n\nThis annual report covers our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance for the fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 2021, and our ongoing initiatives and efforts in Corporate Responsibility.\nWe are delighted to share our latest WBA Environmental, Social and Governance Report with you and to celebrate and acknowledge the huge effort and impact of this vital work.\n\nAs we work to reimagine healthcare in a new era, we are humbled by the critical role Walgreens Boots Alliance is playing in combating the global pandemic.\n\nWorking on the front lines, our team members administered more than 34.6 million COVID-19 vaccinations and more than 10 million tests as of the end of fiscal 2021. Every day, we see how hard our team members work and we are proud of each of them and inspired by their resilience.\n\nIt\u2019s been an extraordinary year, one in which we continued to show who we are as a company:\n\n\u2022 We are a company that strives to ensure healthcare is accessible and equitable for everyone, no matter their race, ethnicity or location.\n\u2022 We are a company that celebrates and embraces diversity, and we hold ourselves accountable to make sure we deliver on our corporate diversity goals.\n\u2022 We are a company that understands how reducing our carbon footprint will not only make the planet healthier, but will make us, our patients and our customers healthier, too.\n\u2022 We are a company that innovates to make sure the packaging of our owned brand products is more sustainable.\n\nFor WBA, our corporate responsibility pillars \u2013 Healthy Communities, Healthy Planet, Healthy and Inclusive Workplace and Sustainable Marketplace \u2013 are at the heart of our purpose to create more joyful lives through better health. It\u2019s what we believe. It\u2019s what we do. It\u2019s who we are.\n\nOur purpose is evident throughout this fiscal 2021 ESG Report, as we share the ongoing progress we\u2019ve made on our sustainability targets and initiatives, our diversity, equity and inclusion goals and our work to ensure health equity for all.\n\nWe partnered with hundreds of community organizations and rolled out an ambitious Vaccine Equity Initiative to combat vaccine hesitancy and ensure lifesaving immunizations were reaching communities that struggle to access healthcare. Learnings from this work will inform our future health equity efforts.\n\nWe know that climate change is caused by human activities and we know it has negative impacts on human health. All companies must do their part to safeguard a liveable planet, and that is particularly important for us as a healthcare company. We have committed to reducing our carbon emissions by 30 percent by 2030 compared with 2019, and for the first time we are including a Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) response. Regarding plastics, we are also publicly reporting our commitments and data on packaging in our owned brands for the first time.\n\nIn DE&I, we took an industry-leading approach, announcing ambitious goals to increase the proportion of women and people of color in leadership roles and linking a portion of incentive pay to performance on these goals. In this report you can read about this performance, how we drive inclusive practices in recruiting and hiring and how we are building a high-performance culture and a winning team.\n\nOur efforts in corporate sustainability are being increasingly recognized by external stakeholders. In 2021, WBA joined the 100 Best Corporate Citizens list for the first time, and was included as a component of the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for a second consecutive year.\n\nWe know that none of this work would have been possible without the continued leadership of Ornella Barra, the Chair of the WBA CSR Committee, whose passion and dedication help advance our ESG agenda.\n\nWe are proud of the work we\u2019ve accomplished and are excited to build and progress even more as we continue to live our purpose, and strive to stay courageous, connected, committed and curious throughout all areas of our company.\n\nJanuary 26, 2022\n\nStefano Pessina\nExecutive Chairman\nWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.\n\nRosalind Brewer\nChief Executive Officer\nWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.\nDuring the second year of the pandemic, what stood out for you in WBA\u2019s response?\n\nAs a pharmacist by background, it is inspiring for me to see our nearly 35,000 pharmacists operating at the top of their profession, being the trusted professional that millions of people have turned to for testing, vaccinations and trusted counsel.\n\nOur U.S. Vaccine Equity Initiative was astounding. We partnered with hundreds of community and government organizations, and we conducted more than 1,200 vaccination clinics, providing more than 200,000 vaccines, mostly in communities of color. We administered millions more vaccines in medically underserved communities where our pharmacies are located.\n\nOperating on the front lines of patient care, we knew we had an important role to play in this phase of fighting the pandemic. We helped build trust in the vaccines through a marketing campaign with support from trusted Black and Hispanic influencers.\n\nIn the UK, Boots supported the National Health Service rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations, with vaccination sites in 55 stores by the end of August. To address access issues, Boots team members were specially trained to support people with hidden disabilities who might need extra assistance to receive the vaccine.\n\nWhat is next for WBA and health equity?\n\nSince 2013, we have supported Vitamin Angels\u2019 efforts to provide vitamins and minerals to undernourished women and children worldwide, and we are building on that with a new prenatal vitamin program in Chicago.\n\nThe $21 million we raised through Red Nose Day in 2021 supports programs for children so they can lead healthier lives. Through Get a Shot. Give a Shot. we have helped provide more than 70 million immunizations to some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable communities through the UN Foundation\u2019s Shot@Life campaign.\n\nOther initiatives include our diabetes and pediatric asthma programs in communities of color in the Chicago area, HIV self-testing in Thailand, and safe spaces for victims of domestic abuse in our pharmacies in the UK, Ireland and Chile.\n\nWe know that climate change is a contributor to health inequities as extreme weather events and drought contribute to unsafe air and drinking water, and to food insecurity. That is just one reason we are doing our part to address climate change through our new target to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWhat were some important achievements for WBA as a corporate citizen during fiscal 2021?\n\nWe cannot drive change in our workplace or in our communities without transparency. We set ourselves ambitious targets for diversity in leadership, we held ourselves accountable by tying part of incentive pay to our performance. I have always been passionate about professional and leadership development for women and minority groups, and it has been immensely gratifying to see us meeting these targets and deepening our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nWhat are WBA\u2019s beauty brands doing to advance the sustainability agenda?\n\nWe continue to strive to meet our customers\u2019 expectations for responsibly sourced products that contribute to a healthy planet and community well-being. I feel immensely proud of the significant progress that has been made across our beauty brands this year.\n\nWe launched the No7 Beauty Company in April 2021 as a consumer led beauty business with bold commitments to sustainability, including halving the overall impact of products we place on the market by 2030. Boots and No7 Beauty Company launched an innovative take-back program for hard-to-recycle cosmetic containers. Liz Earle achieved CarbonNeutral certification for its operations and its Holiday 21 gifting range also achieved CarbonNeutral product certification. Soap & Glory and the Boots gift range \u2018A Little Something\u2019 became our latest brands to achieve Cruelty Free International Leaping Bunny certification, following Botanics and Liz Earle. No7 also launched its flagship Unstoppable Together campaign in the U.S. and UK focused on empowering women and also completely redesigned its iconic 50-milliliter jar to be more sustainable.\n\nWhat comes next for WBA and corporate responsibility?\n\nI\u2019d say continuing to work together and taking a step further in our contribution to build up healthy communities, a healthy planet, a sustainable marketplace and a healthy and Inclusive workplace. Day in and day out, I am inspired by our team members\u2019 passion and dedication. Through their initiatives and example, they truly embody our purpose to help people lead more joyful lives through better health. WBA wants to become an even more consumer-focused healthcare company. This objective comes with taking a leading role in health equity issues and increasingly educating and empowering our customers to make smarter environmental choices.\n\nQ&A with Our CSR Committee Chair\n\nDay in and day out, I am inspired by our team members\u2019 passion and dedication.\n\nOrnella Barra\nChief Operating Officer, International, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.\nChair of the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee\nOur Purpose, Vision and Values\n\nOUR PURPOSE: More joyful lives through better health.\nOUR VISION: To be the leading partner in reimagining local healthcare and well-being for all.\nOUR VALUES: Walgreens Boots Alliance takes seriously its aim of creating joyful lives through better health, reflected in our core values:\n\nCOURAGEOUS\nChallenging the status quo, addressing conflict directly and driving informed risk taking.\n\nCONNECTED\nReflecting the communities we serve, understanding the needs of others and innovating together.\n\nCOMMITTED\nLeading with integrity, building on our legacy and striving boldly toward the future.\n\nCURIOUS\nContinuously learning and adapting, following the science and the data and creating paths where none existed.\n\nAt a Glance: WBA\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance is an integrated healthcare, pharmacy and retail leader serving millions of customers and patients every day, with a 170-year heritage of caring for communities.

103-3)\n\nWBA\u2019s latest ESG materiality assessment was completed during fiscal 2021. We systematically surveyed a wide range of global stakeholders to understand the issues they see emerging over the next decade that will potentially impact WBA and their interaction with the company. Through this exercise we also gauged how the changing context of the pandemic, racial equity issues and rising concerns about climate change and harmful plastic waste were affecting views of ESG impacts throughout our operations.\n\nThe assessment included surveys with close to 300 internal and external stakeholders, followed up by approximately 45 interviews, as well as discussion sessions with employee groups. External stakeholder groups included in the assessment were non-governmental organizations, stockholders, academics, government agencies, community representatives and organizations, suppliers, media and industry groups. In addition, we surveyed some 6,000 customers in the U.S., UK, Chile, Mexico, Norway and Thailand. Those surveyed were asked to consider a time horizon of up to 10 years. International sustainability non-profit \u2018Forum for the Future\u2019 advised us on the assessment and we also used Datamaran\u2019s software analytics tool and online horizon scanning portal to review and analyze topics for our industry and stakeholders.\n\nWe analyzed the customer surveys separately as well as included them in the overall assessment. The customer analysis showed that sustainability is a common concern across all of our markets, especially plastics, although less so in the U.S. Affordable access to quality healthcare is a top concern to customers across our markets along with employee safety, particularly due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe 32 topics included in the materiality assessment are shown in the matrix on page 16, and divided into three areas of importance from very high to moderate. In the table on page 17 we provide definitions of the 24 topics in the two higher-importance areas of the matrix, and map these topics to GRI disclosures.\n\nAmong the new topics in our materiality matrix are plastics, human rights, product end of life, and talent and development. Topics that rose in overall importance and impact include diversity, equity and inclusion; waste; and energy use and climate impacts. As a result of the new materiality mapping, we have added a new GRI disclosure to our report for fiscal 2021: GRI 412 Human Rights Assessment.\nESG materiality matrix\n\nThis matrix shows the issues deemed material to our company from an ESG perspective. Shading indicates very high, high and moderate priority topics, and color coding indicates how each topic aligns with our priority areas.\n\nImportance rankings are based on the weighted average from four sources of stakeholder input: Consumer survey (50%), Internal stakeholder survey (20%), External stakeholder survey (20%), Datamaran inputs (10%).\n### Mapping of ESG material topics\n\nIn the following table we define our material ESG topics - the very high and high priority issues on the matrix - and map them to the corresponding GRI Topic Specific Standards, which are included in this report:\n\n| Material Topic | Definition | Corresponding GRI Topic Specific Standard(s) | Corresponding GRI Topic Specific Standard(s)

most relevant environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues for our company and to deliver products and services that make positive impacts throughout our lines of businesses. We regularly consult with our internal and external stakeholders across a range of sectors, geographies and organization types and sizes, to seek their feedback on our performance in the areas where we have the greatest economic, environmental and social impact.\n\nStakeholders impacted by our business and who influence our business \u2013 such as customers, stockholders and nonprofit groups \u2013 frequently approach us with issues. During fiscal 2021, we engaged stakeholders proactively on numerous matters where we feel we can have significant impact and where we are aware of evolving societal expectations. This proactive engagement included topics such as health equity, vaccine equity, plastic packaging, beauty industry sustainability, diversity, equity and inclusion. Intensified engagement reflecting the urgency of the pandemic and of the racial equity movement are reflected in the table and throughout this report.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we continued to work with the Walgreens External Advisory Council, which was established in fiscal 2019 to advise our U.S. retail pharmacy business on corporate responsibility matters. The council - made up of experts who have a broad range of knowledge on corporate responsibility and health related topics - met in May 2021 with the president of Walgreens and discussed the evolving landscape of ESG leadership, sustainability target setting and Walgreens unique opportunities for contributions, among other topics.\n\nThe tables in this section describe the form and frequency of engagement with key categories of stakeholders during fiscal 2021, their expectations, matters they raised and actions we have taken.\n### ENGAGEMENT WITH NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOs)\n\n|

Communities and patients experiencing health disparities face more barriers to health and wellness services and poorer health outcomes.\n\nWBA aims to be deliberate in our approach to health equity and tackle the root causes of this problem, starting with communities. We believe that achieving health equity is in everyone\u2019s interest and are committed to improving outcomes for everyone by focusing on three pillars: access, partnership, and education.\n\nIn September 2020, Boots Customer Insights and Future of Pharmacy teams undertook qualitative customer surveys to explore the potential health inequalities that might be present in patients who are economically deprived, with a focus on those living in areas of social deprivation or with high ethnic diversity. As healthcare is becoming increasingly person-centric, holistic and focused on maintaining wellness, these insights were sought to help us understand how to best support the future needs of people in this demographic.\n\nIn December 2020, after almost a year of COVID-19 testing and preventative measures, WBA began planning for a global vaccine rollout. We knew our pharmacists would be at the center of helping the world fight the pandemic. As the rollout got underway, Walgreens began administering vaccines in long-term care facilities. Boots UK and Boots Ireland began discussions with the National Health Service and the Health Service Executive, respectively, on their vaccine programs. We knew we had to protect those who were suffering disproportionately from COVID-19: Black and Brown communities. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Black and Brown people were almost three times as likely as non-Hispanic whites to be hospitalized with COVID-19 and twice as likely to die from it.\n\nExperience was on our side. Our implementation of flu vaccines over the years uniquely positioned us to tackle this challenge. Our longstanding partnerships with community organizations helped us spread the word and establish trust.\n\nOur store locations in the U.S. and Puerto Rico are embedded in communities - with approximately 78 percent of the U.S. population living within five miles of one of our retail pharmacies. This means we are uniquely situated to have an impact on almost every community in the country.\n\nAs of the end of fiscal 2021, 73 percent of Walgreens stores were conducting COVID-19 testing, and of those, 53 percent were in high social vulnerability index areas as identified by the CDC.\nDespite the virus\u2019 disproportionate toll on Black and Brown communities, many struggled to access vaccinations or were hesitant due to longstanding mistrust of the healthcare system and government officials. To protect communities of color against the virus, we knew we had to address both issues of access and vaccine hesitancy.\n\n**Walgreens established a Vaccine Equity Task Force, which rapidly implemented the following programs and initiatives:**\n\n- Held more than 1,200 vaccine clinics in locations identified as medically underserved by the CDC\u2019s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), bringing the vaccine into communities that needed it most\n- Elevated the expert, caring voices of our trusted pharmacists, who are embedded in their communities\n- Set up mobile clinics to hold vaccination events in underserved areas in 18 cities across the U.S.\n- Launched the \u201cThis is Our Shot\u201d marketing campaign with influencers and celebrity advocates to encourage vaccination\n- Launched a culturally relevant communications plan with the help of trusted community members to disseminate facts and statistics about the vaccination through panel discussions, fact sheets, a prime time special on NBC and a video series, \u201cThe Vaccine: In Our Words,\u201d that shared perspectives about vaccine importance from experts and stakeholders\nMaking a difference: In outreach\n\nWalgreens could not do this on its own. Armed with CDC data on vulnerable communities, the business worked to understand trusted relationships in these communities, and collaborated with partner organizations to help administer vaccines.\n\nFrom national organizations with local ties, such as the Chicago Urban League, to faith-based organizations, such as the First Ladies Health Initiative, Walgreens worked with more than 650 community organizations on vaccine events - many of which were existing partners from years of supporting community programs and health initiatives.\n\nMaking a difference: In transportation\n\nOne of the biggest factors influencing health equity is transportation. To improve accessibility for vulnerable populations who may struggle getting to vaccine appointments, we partnered with Uber to offer up to 10 million free rides to and from vaccination sites in socially vulnerable communities.\n\nMaking a difference: In outcomes\n\nAs of September 2021, WBA administered more than 202,000 doses in vaccine equity clinics across the U.S.\n\nWalgreens internal data shows business initiatives closed the vaccine equity gap for people of color. Using proprietary methodology, Walgreens measured the percentage of COVID-19 vaccinations provided to non-white populations in metro areas with a high socially vulnerable index and compared it to the percentage of non-white populations in the corresponding geography.\n\nWalgreens aimed to match the population percentage by 90 percent. As of July 27, 2021, Walgreens exceeded its goal with a 99 percent match, compared with 75 percent on April 1, 2021, and 53 percent on March 1, 2021.\n\nBoots addresses health equity\n\nIn the UK, one of the main drivers affecting health equity is access to healthcare for marginalized communities, including those with disabilities. Through support of the Hidden Disabilities Sunflower scheme, patients with autism, chronic pain, dementia and visual or hearing impairments could wear a sunflower lanyard to alert Boots team members that they may need extra assistance to receive the vaccine. As part of the national vaccination process, the Sunflower Scheme worked with the NHS and vaccine providers to highlight the scheme.\n\nIn January 2021, the first Boots UK mass COVID-19 vaccination site opened in Halifax. The goal was to administer 1,000 vaccines per week. Just one month later, there were 11 vaccine sites in Boots stores throughout the UK. By the end of fiscal 2021, 63.8 percent of the U.K. population had been fully vaccinated, thanks in part to Boots UK\u2019s support of the National Health Service rollout.\n\nFor Boots Ireland, summer 2021 was a summer of firsts. In mid-June, the pharmacy administered its first COVID-19 vaccine in Dublin. That began a rollout of vaccine jabs through 81 pharmacies throughout the Republic of Ireland. July saw the addition of COVID-19 rapid antigen tests in 14 of its stores, building upon the 18 stores where PCR tests were available.\nHealth equity: Beyond COVID-19\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 203-1, 203-2, 413-1)\n\nWBA\u2019s commitment to health equity did not start with the COVID-19 vaccination and will not end with it. To continue the understanding around how to address health equity, Boots UK in 2021 set up a dedicated Health Equity Stakeholder Group to help establish forward-looking strategy. We also showcased our commitment in the following ways:\n\nHealth Equity Incubator\n\nThe Walgreens Chicago Health Equity Incubator pilot began in Chicago in August 2020 with one store. Three months later, it expanded to 15 more stores on the South and West sides of Chicago. The purpose of the incubator is to address health disparities through pharmacist provided patient- and community-centered healthcare services.\n\nThe initial pilot focused on impacting patient outcomes with three interventions:\n\nDiabetes:\nThe disparities in diabetes prevalence among people of color are almost double that of non-Hispanic whites, with roughly 12.1 percent of adult Black Americans diagnosed with diabetes compared to 7.4 percent of adult white Americans. To try and combat these disparities, Walgreens used predictive analytics to identify patients most likely to become non-adherent, and provided early, proactive intervention to identify and address barriers in order to improve patient health outcomes. The incubator efforts resulted in interventions provided to more than 10,400 patients by the end of August, and preliminary analyses indicate that the health equity diabetes intervention improved medication adherence. On-time refills for patients in the Incubator stores (percent refilling within seven days of due date) were significantly better compared to control locations, and diabetes patients saw statistically significant improvements in optimal adherence (average adherence above 80 percent).\n\nPediatric asthma:\nIn the U.S., 18 percent of Black children have asthma compared to roughly 9 percent of white children. That disparity prompted Walgreens to track the asthma medication ratio, calculated by totaling the units of daily inhalers \u2013 preventative inhalers used to control asthma \u2013 and dividing by total number of daily and rescue inhalers. When that ratio is low and the patients have other high risk factors \u2013 such as comorbidities, pharmacists contact the patient to have a conversation about adherence and correct inhaler use, with a goal to avoid frequent emergency room visits. Asthma patients with a new inhaler prescription are also counseled to ensure they understand why their provider prescribed the medication and proper use. Walgreens has completed more than 2,500 pediatric asthma consultations through the end of FY21 to support patients and their guardians.\n\nTargeted Delayed Pickup Outreach:\nTo support patient medication adherence, every store across the Walgreens chain conducts proactive outreach to patients who have not yet picked up their filled prescriptions. However, recognizing that non-medical factors such as cost and transportation, can contribute to prescription abandonment by patients in vulnerable communities, Walgreens dedicated additional resources to each store in the Chicago Incubator to support existing proactive outreach efforts. Additionally, free same-day delivery was offered to patients to address barriers to pick-up experienced in these locations.\nFlu equity\n\nWalgreens is committed to helping protect uninsured and underinsured people from exposure to the flu, which causes tens of thousands of deaths in the U.S. every year. Walgreens pledged to donate $5 million worth of free flu shot vouchers in the U.S. by 2024, and reached $4.5 million by the end of fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2021 alone, 117,000 vouchers were distributed equating to $1.5 million.\n\nSince 2010, Walgreens has provided more than 1.9 million free flu vaccinations to customers who present a voucher, helping to address health disparities for underserved communities.\n\nLike the COVID-19 vaccine, there is hesitancy among certain communities regarding the flu vaccine. Using the playbook from the Vaccine Equity Task Force, Walgreens implemented flu equity outreach via offsite clinics and partnerships with community organizations such as faith-based groups, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and federally qualified health centers.\n\nBoots offered free flu vaccinations on behalf of the NHS for those eligible, and privately for those who are not eligible for free vaccinations. Boots offered a free vaccination to all its 52,000 team members for the second year running. It also ran a Corporate Flu Vaccination Service for organizations that wish to pay for and then offer their employees a free flu vaccination.\n\nFree COVID-19 tests\n\nTesting for COVID-19 remains one of the most effective ways of keeping safe. However, access and affordability for over-the-counter (OTC) tests can be a barrier for some patients. Walgreens \u2013 together with Abbott Laboratories \u2013 implemented a four-week pilot program in Philadelphia in June 2021 to hand out free OTC tests for Electronic Benefit Transfer and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) holders. Throughout the pilot, 259 OTC units were provided, showing a 330 percent increase from week one to week four.\nIn this section we report on our progress on the following commitments:\n\n- Programs and campaigns to improve access to affordable, quality healthcare and awareness about critical health issues, with a specific focus on health equity\n- Efforts to help combat opioid abuse and prevent overdose-related deaths\n- Partnerships to help support people living with cancer, empower young people and combat hygiene poverty\nFiscal 2021 Healthy Communities Highlights\n\n91,571+\nWBA employees reported more than 91,571 volunteer hours\n\n34M\nconsumers participated in health education initiatives through Walgreens.com\n\nAdministered millions of COVID-19 vaccines, completed millions of tests and fulfilled millions of same-day orders\n\nFor the third year running, Boots UK - Macmillan Cancer Support partnership was voted Most Admired Corporate-NGO partnership in the C&E Barometer\n\nIn partnership with The Hygiene Bank, Boots UK and No7 Beauty Company have donated more than 680,000 toiletries and essentials to people living in hygiene poverty\n\nBoots UK and Ireland launched its new digital health platform, Boots Health Hub\n\nRaised more than $21 million for Red Nose Day in the USA bringing the total raised to more than $240 million since 2016\nHealthcare Access, Awareness and Education\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 203-1, 203-2, 413-1)\n\nTransformational consumer-centric healthcare strategy\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 203-1, 203-2)\n\nAs one of the largest companies in the world dispensing medications, and through our delivery of other healthcare services, WBA is uniquely positioned to make an impact on healthcare access and affordability. Through our business activities, advocacy work and ESG initiatives, we work to improve healthcare access for millions of people, especially in markets with large populations of uninsured and underinsured people.\n\nIn October 2021, WBA announced its new consumer-centric healthcare strategy, featuring the launch of Walgreens Health, a new business segment enabled by investments in VillageMD and CareCentrix.\n\nEquitable, personalized, whole-person healthcare for local communities in the U.S. is at the very heart of this new vision and ambition, including an explicit business strategy to create greater access for every person in every community and to serve the specific needs of each neighborhood. Expanded access and price transparency improve adherence to medications and patient outcomes as well as community health resiliency.\n\nThis strategy accelerates WBA\u2019s path to become a leading provider of local clinical care services, addressing all dimensions of physical, emotional and mental health. We will leverage our consumer-centric technology and pharmacy network to deliver and enable others to deliver value-based care. This will include vaccinations, diagnostic testing, chronic care management and specialty management.\n\nThe global pandemic has validated the role of pharmacy in local communities, as we have administered millions of vaccines, completed millions of COVID-19 tests and fulfilled millions of same-day orders. Our pharmacists are trusted, expert voices to help people stay safe and healthy from the virus.\n\nWBA plays an essential role in improving health outcomes and empowering patients to take control of their health through our pharmacy-centric business model, including community pharmacies and digital services. As a touchpoint for millions of patients, our company educates and raises awareness about health issues and conditions, reaching people with vital information that can improve individual health and community resiliency. As we execute on our new healthcare strategy, the number of in-store health services increased significantly year-over-year with 374 new locations.\nThese are the main ways we are working to transform areas of healthcare to bring critical services to communities, in person and digitally, and to educate and raise awareness:\n\nIn our businesses, we are developing innovative, accessible healthcare options with a focus on personalization. We are accelerating our path to become a leading provider of local clinical care services.\n\nIn the U.S., our government relations team advocates for drug price transparency, passing on savings to patients at the pharmacy counter and for an enhanced role for pharmacists to help patients find best-priced options.\n\nIn the UK, Ireland and Germany, where single-payer systems mean affordability is not as much of an issue, our focus is on increasing access that is convenient to the customer, offering culturally competent care and leveraging the scale of our retail store footprint.\n\nFor our own employees, we are committed to providing quality, affordable healthcare and services to manage their conditions and improve health outcomes. Details are included in the Healthy and Inclusive Workplace section of this report.\n\nWe drive improved health outcomes through medication adherence, care management and closing gaps in patient healthcare in our business operations.\n\nWe engage patients through our retail pharmacies, our trusted brands and our digital tools and partnering with nonprofit groups and government agencies on campaigns to:\n\n- Empower patients to take control of their own health;\n- Incentivize healthy behavior, preventive measures and smoking cessation;\n- Reduce stigma around conditions such as HIV and dementia;\n- Improve access to healthcare and vaccines.\n\nOur performance metrics on these topics are as follows:\n\n| Key Performance Indicator | Fiscal 2021 Performance |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Number of new in-store health service locations that increase access | Increased 36 percent, driven primarily by expanded primary care and diagnostic lab location through our collaborations with VillageMD and Labcorp. services |\n| Number of collaborations with healthcare service providers covered on the Walgreens app through Walgreens Find Care, which help increase access | 58 including services offering diabetes management, telehealth such as virtual primary care doctor visits, pain management, eye exams, laboratory testing, weight loss support, teletherapy for mental health, sleep solutions and more |\n| Number of consumers who participate in health education initiatives through clicks on healthcare focused topics on Walgreens.com. These topics include COVID-19, flu, immunizations, Medicare, allergies, diabetes, pain, HIV and others | 34 million |\n\n1This KPI maps to Material Topic 1: Access to Affordable and Quality Healthcare\n2Fiscal 2021 performance information is GRI 101-2.5 specified disclosure and is within the Deloitte & Touche LLP review scope as detailed on pages 118-119\n3This KPI maps to Material Topic 11: Consumer Health Education and Marketing. Number of clicks has been impacted by COVID-19 topics available on Walgreens.com.\nThe critical role of pharmacists\n\nRetail pharmacies are often the first place a patient goes for treatment or preventive care. With thousands of retail pharmacies in numerous countries, more than 116,000 healthcare service providers among our employees with nearly 35,0001 being registered pharmacists, plus a scope of pharmacy services including retail, specialty, medical facility, mail, online and mobile, WBA provides a unique resource.\n\nWe see our role as an integral part of the patient\u2019s healthcare team and aim to deepen this partnership to improve patient health outcomes, especially for chronic and complex conditions.\n\nPharmacists are on the front lines of neighborhood healthcare, providing medication management, administering vaccinations, and partnering with health systems to advance health and wellness.\n\nInnovating to improve healthcare access\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)\n\nAt WBA, we believe that \u201cpeople + technology\u201d deliver greater care and our teams truly exemplified this philosophy during the height of the pandemic.\n\nWe knew that our patients still needed access to healthcare and products, so we created differentiated omni-channel experiences to help patients digitally and in-store. As a result, we saw an increase in digital sales of more than 100 percent.\n\nFollowing the success of the digital health platform, Walgreens Find Care, Boots launched its own digital platform to make healthcare more accessible.\n\nTo create a better integrated healthcare experience, we rebranded and launched myWalgreens, which by the end of fiscal 2021 had more than 85 million members. In addition, patients used the Walgreens app to schedule COVID-19 and flu vaccinations.\n\nBoots UK and Boots Ireland released the Boots Health Hub, a digital services platform that gives customers visiting boots.com access to nearly 100 different healthcare services, including healthcare tests, COVID-19 services, vaccinations, prescriptions, Livit\u2019s Online GP consultations and the Boots Online Doctor service. The Boots Online Doctor, a virtual service for more than 45 common healthcare conditions, provides quick access to advice and prescription-only medicine without having to see a GP.\n\n1Information disclosed is SASB HC-DR-000.D specified disclosure and is within the Deloitte & Touche LLP review scope as detailed on pages 118-119.\nAddressing the high cost of care\n\nAffordability is primarily an issue for our U.S. business and for our two Latin American retail pharmacy chains, Farmacias Benavides in Mexico and Farmacias Ahumada in Chile.\n\nWe know that the high cost of prescription medications can lead to adherence issues as well as prescription abandonment.\n\nWalgreens collaborates with other businesses and organizations in the pharmaceutical supply chain to make medications more affordable and accessible through copay assistance. In fiscal 2021, the Walgreens community-based specialty pharmacies helped approximately 923,000 patients in the U.S. secure more than $436 million in copay assistance for prescriptions during fiscal 2021.\n\nWe flag for our team members at point-of-sale where copay assistance may be available, as well as dedicated centralized support teams that proactively contact patients using our traditional retail pharmacies for copays and plans that meet specific parameters.\n\nOur enterprise triage solution allows us to seamlessly care for patients in the appropriate channel based on limited distribution drug networks, payer restriction and other considerations. We have a focused investment in this solution to consider additional factors, such as if the patient is new to therapy, as well as advanced data analytics and modeling to further reduce friction for our patients and providers.\n\nIn Chile and Mexico, where out-of-pocket payments can present a barrier to care, we operate national pharmacy chains and understand the healthcare operations and limitations.\n\nIn Chile, the Ahumada Contigo (Ahumada With You) access program, launched in fiscal 2018 with 250 products, has expanded to include more than 700 products that patients affiliated with the public healthcare system can purchase at significantly lower prices at Farmacias Ahumada.\n\nThe high-quality generics brand Almus was introduced in our Mexican chain Farmacias Benavides in 2019 and has expanded to 335 products. In fiscal 2021 we worked to confirm that we had an Almus option for all core chronic conditions and reviewed pricing in an attempt to achieve price parity with other brands. In particular we aim to make sure that our pricing is accessible for patients who have all three conditions: diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure.\nAdvocacy work on drug pricing, expanded role of pharmacists in the U.S.\n\n(GRI 103-2)\n\nIn the United States, rising costs are cited as a significant cause by many patients who do not purchase and take their medications as directed, which impacts health outcomes. Walgreens follows two guiding principles on drug pricing: drug prices should be transparent as they move through the supply chain; and savings should be passed on to patients to lower their out-of-pocket costs. Walgreens has advocated for a new Part D pharmacy real-time benefit tool that would provide pharmacists the ability to help patients fully understand where they are in the benefit phases and their out-of-pocket (OOP) costs requirements. The pharmacist can then assist the patient in finding ways to lower their OOP costs, which can increase medication adherence.\n\nWalgreens continues to advocate for policies that expand prescribing authority for pharmacists to improve outcomes and increase accessibility to care. This includes the ability to initiate certain prescriptions, conduct point-of-care testing and provide clinical advice.\n\nWalgreens, Boots UK and other WBA businesses worked extensively with government bodies, using a collaborative approach to deliver and support COVID-19 testing and vaccinations and to disseminate trustworthy information to combat vaccine hesitancy. Our businesses have helped to accelerate the availability of vaccines and have helped reach underserved communities with vaccines. More information on these efforts can be found in the Health Equity section of this report.\nMedication Adherence\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 203-1)\n(SASB HC-DR-260b.1)\n\nOur pharmacy businesses play a significant role in improving societal health and well-being by helping patients adhere to medication regimens, close gaps and overcome barriers in care. Poverty, lack of insurance, limited transportation options, inconvenience, complexity of regimens, concerns about interactions with other drugs and food, unawareness of risks of skipping medication or unconscious issues such as forgetfulness can all be factors in medication adherence. Not taking medications as prescribed is associated with adverse health outcomes and rising healthcare costs.\n\nRecognizing that diabetes, high cholesterol and hypertension are prevalent among Americans, we tailored specific programs to help improve outcomes for patients living with these disease states. Across these conditions, Walgreens PDC (Proportion of Days Covered) rates improved by 1 percent in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. PDC is a common measurement for adherence referring to the percentage of time a patient has medication available based on refill records.\n\nWalgreens pharmacists work with physicians, health systems, health plans, pharmaceutical companies and patients to remove barriers to taking medications as prescribed, and closing gaps in care for patients. Adherence programs for the most complex treatments and disease state management programs include phone, digital and in-person consultations to address potential side effects and offer remedies, connecting patients to financial assistance to ensure they stay on therapies and providing digital solutions including medication synchronization, delivery, consultations and patient education.\n\nWalgreens is committed to continued education for pharmacists, such as on diabetes management and other chronic conditions. Cholesterol management pharmacist training was implemented during fiscal 2021. It provided pharmacists with foundational knowledge to help improve the health and well-being of patients diagnosed with hyperlipidemia. Pharmacists explored skills and resources to empower patients to track their disease state, improve outcomes, increase adherence to treatment protocols, and lower long-term healthcare costs.\n\nAnalytics help us predict the patients most likely to become non-adherent and identify custom ways to reach them and keep them on track. Technology supports our patients through digital tools and our pharmacists through our adherence clinical platform.\n\nWalgreens works to improve medication adherence, close gaps in care and help manage chronic disease through:\n\nWalgreens Patient Care Portal\nHelps pharmacists identify patients eligible for Medication Therapy Management Services and medication reviews, prompting pharmacy employees to contact patients, notably with high risks, to connect them with appropriate interventions including:\n\n- Comprehensive disease-state management\n- Proactive care for patients taking specialty medications for HIV and chronic inflammatory disease\n- New-to-therapy consultations supporting patients with new prescriptions and diagnoses\n- Customized patient assistance with obtaining medications or other items via delivery, curbside pickup or drive-thru\n\nWalgreens Advanced Care Program\nApplies predictive analytics to identify patients at higher risk for non-adherence, allowing holistic intervention to remove barriers. Through this program, our Health Outcomes Pharmacists and Advanced Care Consultants hold conversations with our patients to close gaps in care and uncover and resolve barriers to medication adherence.\n\nMobile App\nWalgreens free, five-star-rated mobile app provides access to digital resources, such as Rx Alerts, reminding patients to fill and pick up prescriptions.\n\n90-Day Prescriptions\nWith Walgreens assistance, as of August 2021, 31.9 million patients were enrolled in the 90-day refills program, making medications more convenient.\n\nSave a Trip Refills\nAllows customers to align multiple prescriptions to one date. More than 5.6 million patients were enrolled as of Aug. 31, 2021, saving three pharmacy trips a year on average.\n\nWalgreens Express\nPatients can prepay for medication and define their next-day delivery or pickup location on mobile devices.\nResponding to mental health needs\n\nAs self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression have tripled among U.S. adults since the onset of the pandemic, according to the CDC, Walgreens Boots Alliance reinforced our commitment to mental health services.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, more than 1,000 Walgreens pharmacists participated in Mental Health First Aid training aiming to become a greater resource for the one in five people in the U.S. struggling with mental health conditions. For its part, Boots introduced new services aimed to help meet the growing need in the UK.\n\nWalgreens first introduced Mental Health First Aid training for certain team members in the human resources department in 2019, and later made the program available for some pharmacy staff.\n\nMental Health First Aid is administered by the National Council for Mental Wellbeing, and trains participants in mental health literacy, understanding risk factors and warning signs for mental health and addiction concerns and strategies for how to help someone in both crisis and non-crisis situations. Walgreens, the National Council and American Pharmacists Association spearheaded the initiative to create the training program, which is now available industry-wide for pharmacists.\n\nBoots UK pharmacists in England undergo Zero Suicide Alliance training as part of The Pharmacy Quality Scheme (PQS) within the Community Pharmacy Contractual Framework (CPCF). In addition Boots has more than 180 Mental Health First Aiders in stores and the support office trained to assist team members. Boots partnered with Ieso Digital Health to offer its How Are Things mood and symptom checker through the Boots Health Hub - a digital resource offering a wide range of healthcare and pharmacy services.\n\nThe pandemic took a toll on everyone, but especially healthcare workers on the front lines. For our pharmacists, the toll manifested in struggles with mental health and well-being, which is why Boots UK signed the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS) of Great Britain\u2019s Inclusion and Wellbeing Pledge, to actively support the health of pharmacists and also to promote more inclusion in the workplace. This pledge also extends to patients and the communities we serve, because we believe that everyone has the right to feel good.\n\nMore information for mental health benefits for team members can be found in the Employee Health and Well-being section of this report.\n\nSupporting victims of domestic abuse\n\nSocial distancing and lockdown measures during the COVID-19 pandemic offered a new method of control over victims of domestic abuse. Self-isolation created an increased level of uncertainty for people looking to escape an abusive relationship, and made it very difficult for them to seek essential support from their friends, families, and co-workers.\n\nDuring this challenging time, Boots UK provided a lifeline to some of the most vulnerable in our communities by training more than 19,500 pharmacy team members as part of the UK government\u2019s Ask for ANI code-word initiative. It also continued to operate the Safe Spaces Initiative with UK SAYS NO MORE, Hestia\u2019s national campaign for domestic abuse and sexual violence. Boots Ireland operates a similar campaign with Safe Ireland, a national social change agency. These initiatives allow those at risk or suffering from abuse to discreetly signal that they need help and access to support, and a trained member of Boots pharmacy team will then offer a private space where they can access support services. Across the UK these initiatives have been accessed an estimated 1,600 times in Boots pharmacies as of Aug. 31, 2021.\n\nFor the fifth year, Boots team members also volunteered to support the Wash Bag project, which was initiated by HRH The Duchess of Cornwall. As part of the initiative, team members prepared wash bags filled with toiletries that survivors of sexual assault are given free-of-charge after receiving a forensic examination at a Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC). In fiscal 2021, Boots delivered over 6,500 wash bags, helping to provide some degree of comfort and familiarity for victims during a very sensitive time. Since the start of the partnership in 2017, almost 43,000 wash bags have been donated to SARCs across the UK.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Farmacias Ahumada supported Mask 19 in Chile. Anyone experiencing domestic violence could enter an Ahumada store and request Mask 19, a keyword that activated a protocol in which members of the pharmacy team would then share the victim\u2019s contact information with a dedicated hotline providing guidance and support.\nHIV testing in the U.S. and Thailand\n\nIn support of National HIV Testing Day on June 27, 2021, Greater Than AIDS and Walgreens, together with OraSure Technologies, provided more than 5,000 donated OraQuick In-Home HIV Tests to 175 health departments and HIV/AIDS service organizations across the U.S.\n\nThe Greater Than AIDS/Walgreens National HIV Community Partnership (NHCP) has expanded free HIV testing and information for 11 years. Fiscal 2021 was the second year the partnership donated HIV self-tests, providing an alternative to in-person testing limited by COVID-19, with more than 15,300 distributed through the program since 2020.\n\nBy distributing the HIV self-tests to local organizations, the partnership reinforces the role local agencies play in supporting clients through the testing experience with counseling and linkage services, including to PrEP and HIV treatment.\n\nIn August 2020, Boots Thailand collaborated with The Department of Disease Control (DDC) and Thailand MOPH-U.S. CDC collaboration (TUC) to launch a demonstration project of HIV self-testing pharmacy-based service model in Bangkok, Thailand. The project provides rapid, private testing to allow people to know faster if they have HIV and get access to treatment. As of December 2021, more than 2,000 free test kits were delivered to interested people or picked up in stores. These led to more than 40 self-reported reactive test results and patients were referred to a hospital for confirmatory testing and treatment.\n\nDementia awareness\n\nThere are currently around 900,000 people living with dementia in the UK, and this figure is projected to rise to 1.6 million by 2040. To help provide a dementia-friendly environment, Boots UK, Boots Opticians and Boots Ireland offer learning tools to help team members understand the common challenges a person living with dementia may encounter in a store environment.\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, almost 800 additional Boots UK team members completed an e-learning module to become a Dementia Friend, a program developed by the Alzheimer\u2019s Society. As of Aug. 31, 2021, Boots UK had more than 28,900 Dementia Friends, with at least one in each Boots store available to support customers and patients. As one of 40 partners on the Dementia: Understand Together campaign, Boots Ireland is the only retailer in Ireland to have offered its awareness module to all of its team members, with almost 2,000 (97 percent) team members having completed the e-Learning module as of Aug. 31, 2021.\n\nTeam members who have completed their dementia learning are easily recognizable with their Dementia Friends badges in the UK, and Dementia: Understand Together badges in Ireland, helping people shopping at Boots who live with dementia to feel safe, calm and comfortable.\nSmoking cessation\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)\n\nWalgreens has de-emphasized tobacco products, stopped selling e-cigarettes and taken steps to address the matter of tobacco sales to minors. Walgreens has a zero-tolerance policy prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to those under 21, and any employee violating the policy is subject to immediate termination. We require age verification from anyone purchasing these products, regardless of age, in all of our U.S. stores. Store employees are trained on this policy and signs notify customers of the ID rule.\n\nWalgreens is committed to having pharmacy play a role in helping people quit tobacco. Walgreens pharmacists are trained to support a patient\u2019s attempt to quit. The business also offers digital support tools and prescription and over-the-counter products. In fiscal 2021, we saw an increase in sales of smoking cessation products in our stores, compared with fiscal 2020.\n\nSince its inception in October 2015, and as of Aug. 31, 2021, the Walgreens quit smoking page has received more than 387,000 visits.\n\nMore than 350 team members completed a stop smoking program during fiscal 2021. The program includes a personalized plan, talking to a trained pharmacist and receiving free nicotine replacement therapy patches or gum.\nOpioid Abuse Prevention\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 203-1)\n\nThe opioid abuse crisis has continued to grow, with COVID-19 a contributing factor. The pandemic has affected mental health and access to treatment for drug abuse and health issues. More than 69,000 people died in the U.S. from opioid overdoses in 2020, a sharp increase from 2019, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The situation - largely driven by illicit fentanyl - continues to devastate families and entire communities.\n\nOur stakeholders expect us to play a significant role in helping to address the U.S. opioid epidemic, given our influence as a leader in the retail pharmacy industry, our scale of operations and our expansive reach across local communities. Walgreens is focused on collaborative solutions, working with government and business partners on drug take back and addiction mitigation initiatives. The WBA board of directors continues to oversee our management of risks related to the dispensing of prescription opioid medication and our multi-million dollar effort to help combat overdose-related deaths.\n\nWe have worked with representatives at all levels of government, numerous public agencies, research organizations and industry groups to drive and influence legislation related to prescription opioids.\n\nWalgreens maintains a Good Faith Dispensing policy, which provides the foundation for our pharmacists to understand their roles and responsibilities when dispensing prescriptions for controlled substances. This policy requires a pharmacist to evaluate the patient, the prescriber, the drug, the applicable law and the surrounding circumstances prior to making an appropriate professional decision whether to dispense a prescription for a controlled substance. Walgreens supports our pharmacists\u2019 right to refuse to fill controlled substance prescriptions in accordance with their corresponding responsibility, if, among other reasons, prescribers do not provide sufficient supporting information.\n\nWalgreens supports CDC recommendations by educating patients about naloxone when they are dispensed high doses of certain prescription opioids and who may be at risk of accidental overdose.\n\nDuring fiscal 2021 Walgreens announced a partnership with US WorldMeds, a Kentucky-based specialty pharmaceutical company to stock Lucemyra (lofexidine) tablets in Walgreens pharmacies across the U.S. Lucemyra is the only FDA-approved, non-opioid, non-addictive treatment for relief of multiple symptoms of opioid withdrawal in adults.\n\nWalgreens continues to participate in the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s (DEA) National Prescription Drug Take Back Day, held twice a year, when select Walgreens stores throughout the country serve as a collection point for law enforcement who collect unwanted, unused or expired medication for safe disposal.\n\nOn this page are updates on our progress on ongoing initiatives to combat prescription drug abuse.\n\n| LIFESAVING OPIOID OVERDOSE ANTIDOTE NALOXONE | SAFE MEDICATION DISPOSAL | TIME-DELAY, HIGH SECURITY PHARMACY SAFES |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| AVAILABLE without a prescription in all Walgreens pharmacies | 1,400+ safe medication disposal kiosks in Walgreens locations | ALL U.S. stores have safes installed |\n| 750,000+ kits dispensed | 1.7M+ take-home safe medication disposal kits shipped to stores since May 2019 | SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED pharmacy robberies and burglaries; employee safety improved |\n| 1,550 TONS (1,406 METRIC TONNES) of unwanted medication safely disposed of since 2016 | 482 TONS (437 METRIC TONNES) disposed of in fiscal 2021 | |\nPartnerships for Good\n\nThrough our long-term partnerships with organizations with healthcare expertise, we tackle important health issues including malnutrition, disease prevention and cancer support. Our collaborations provide healthcare services at national and international levels, including developing countries, enabling us to help improve the lives of hundreds of millions of vulnerable people, especially women and children.\n\nIn the area of cancer care, WBA focuses on creating innovative and meaningful support for patients and their loved ones in three ways: assisting people living with cancer, working with organizations that advance research and supporting prevention programs. We work with cancer organizations to train our pharmacists and beauty consultants so they can provide expert advice and support to cancer patients, their families and their caregivers, when they need it most. With many cancer patients experiencing significant delays in receiving diagnosis and treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic, our pharmacies and stores continue to be a trusted, convenient source of care.\n\nWe continue to build and deepen our relationships with four organizations that joined the WBA-facilitated Collaboration for Cancer Prevention, Research and Support in 2019: Macmillan Cancer Support, Susan G. Komen (Komen), The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). In fiscal 2021, we organized three virtual meetings to continue joint initiatives, developing and supporting innovative cancer research infrastructure, and sharing best practices in patient-centered care with a particular focus on health equity.\n\nWe also work with charitable partners that help empower young people to reach their full potential. By providing lifesaving immunizations, vitamins, essential hygiene products and more, we are committed to supporting the health and well-being of future generations.\n\nThrough our charitable partnerships we aim to lead by example and be a catalyst for others to do good. To maximize our impact, we created several initiatives that our team members, customers, patients, suppliers and local communities are empowered to support. These programs generate enthusiasm, increase team member satisfaction and engagement, and build customer loyalty.\nRed Nose Day\n(GRI 103-2, 203-1, 413-1)\nChildren in the U.S. are facing higher levels of hunger, homelessness and a growing learning gap due to the widespread ripple effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Together with Comic Relief U.S., the founding nonprofit, Walgreens supported Red Nose Day for the seventh year. Continuing to emphasize the health and safety of team members and customers, Walgreens welcomed the return of Digital Red Noses, bringing people together virtually to spread awareness, raise funds and support children in need.\n\nNew in fiscal 2021, customers could donate through the myWalgreens app and desktop, in addition to donating in Walgreens stores and online at Walgreens.com. Through team member, customer and supplier contributions, Walgreens raised more than $21 million for Red Nose Day during the fiscal 2021 campaign, benefiting grantee partner organizations that help underserved children both domestically and internationally to stay safe, healthy, educated and empowered.\n\nVitamin Angels\n(GRI 103-2, 203-1, 413-1)\nSince 2013, Vitamin Angels has been our trusted partner to help address child and maternal health in marginalized communities. As of Aug. 31, 2021, the award-winning partnership has provided more than 300 million undernourished children and expectant mothers with life-changing vitamins and minerals in all 50 U.S. states and more than 65 countries around the world. In October 2021, WBA and Vitamin Angels announced a new goal to reach a combined total of 500 million women and children by August 2025.\n\nWalgreens donates 1 percent of sales of select vitamins and supplements, including owned brand vitamins, to Vitamin Angels, reaching $12.4 million in total donations during fiscal 2021.\n\nGet a Shot. Give a Shot.\n(GRI 103-2, 203-1, 413-1)\nWalgreens and the United Nations (UN) Foundation\u2019s Shot@Life campaign continue to collaborate to provide vaccines globally through the Walgreens Get a Shot. Give a Shot. program. Over eight years, Walgreens has helped provide more than 70 million lifesaving polo and measles vaccines to children in developing countries by donating to the UN Foundation for every immunization administered at Walgreens and Duane Reade pharmacies and clinics. WBA has committed to help provide a total of 100 million immunizations for children in developing countries by 2024.\nMacmillan Cancer Support\n(GRI 103-2, 203-1, 413-1)\n\nMacmillan Cancer Support estimates that almost 50,000 people are \u2018missing\u2019 a cancer diagnosis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Helping to provide accessible and trusted support in local communities, Boots UK gave all of its pharmacists the time to complete training to become a Boots Macmillan Information Pharmacist (BMIP), doubling the number of BMIPs to more than 4,200 during fiscal 2021. The bespoke training helps pharmacists understand the holistic needs of people living with and affected by cancer, support those receiving end-of-life care, and provide specialist information and support. Boots Macmillan Beauty Advisor (BMBAs) training was also updated during fiscal 2021, in collaboration with Boots Research and Development team, the University of Manchester and Macmillan Cancer Support to help patients experiencing the visible side effects of cancer treatment.\n\nBoots UK\u2019s BMIPs and BMBAs are estimated to have collectively conducted almost 100,000 in-store and virtual conversations and consultations. The online consultations were developed to help support people sheltering at home during the pandemic and are delivered via digital healthcare providers LIVI Connect and boots.com.\n\nBBC Children in Need\n(GRI 103-2, 203-1, 413-1)\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, Boots UK and Boots Opticians team members and customers raised \u00a3750,000 ($1.02 million) to support BBC Children in Need. As its 17-year partnership draws to a close, Boots UK, with the help of customers, team members and suppliers, has raised a cumulative total of \u00a314.5 million ($19.7 million), which has helped fund BBC Children in Need projects that improve the lives of disadvantaged children and young people in communities across the UK.\n\nThe Hygiene Bank\n(GRI 103-2, 203-1, 413-1)\n\nBoots UK began working with its new strategic CSR partner The Hygiene Bank in fiscal 2020 and continued to expand its work on hygiene poverty - the inability to afford basic hygiene and personal grooming products - during fiscal 2021.\n\nA survey commissioned by Boots UK and The Hygiene Bank found 69 percent of teachers have observed hygiene poverty in students, and the issue has been amplified following the COVID-19 pandemic. To tackle the growing issue, Boots UK partnered with The Hygiene Bank to create educational resources for primary and secondary school students to help them understand hygiene poverty.\n\nBoots in-store donation points for The Hygiene Bank grew to 400 from 245, and customers are encouraged to donate new, unused and in-date toiletries, including hygiene, beauty and personal care essentials. Customers can also donate directly to the charity by purchasing newly launched online vouchers on boots.com. In fiscal 2021, when schools and communities were most in need, Boots UK enacted its You Donate = We Donate program, donating four full-sized products for every kilogram that customers donated to The Hygiene Bank.\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, Boots UK and No7 Beauty Company donated more than 680,000 products to those living in hygiene poverty, supporting over 155 local communities and over 775 charities across the UK. Since the beginning of the partnership, customers have donated more than 18 metric tonnes of toiletries in Boots stores.\nBaan Gerda\n(GRI 103-2, 203-1, 413-1)\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, Boots Retail Thailand donated 792,000 Thai baht ($25,500) to its charity partner Baan Gerda through donation boxes located in all Boots stores across Thailand. Baan Gerda supports children and orphans infected with HIV across Thailand and since the partnership began in 2010, Boots Thailand has helped raise approximately 19.5 million Thai baht ($628,000) for Baan Gerda.\n\nIn-person volunteering at Baan Gerda\u2019s home for children was not possible during 2021 due to continued COVID-19 restrictions, so Boots Thailand team members organized a drawing competition instead. The three winners each received a donation to help cover their school costs.\n\nThe Irish Cancer Society\n(GRI 103-2, 203-1, 413-1)\n\nDespite COVID-19 social distancing guidelines, Boots Ireland experienced its most successful fundraising year to date in partnership with the Irish Cancer Society. For the fourth year, Boots Ireland was the main sponsor of Daffodil Day, and it welcomed the return of its annual Night Walk event, where fundraisers completed a 5km walk at a time and location of their choice.\n\nThanks to the support of team members, customers, patients and local communities, Boots Ireland raised more than \u20ac370,000 ($442,000) for the Irish Cancer Society\u2019s Night Nursing Service during fiscal 2021, which provides end-of-life care for cancer patients. Since the partnership began in 2012, Boots Ireland has raised more than \u20ac2.2 million (more than $2.6 million), equating to more than 6,600 nights of care.\n\nAlong with supporting the Night Nursing Service, Boots Ireland has more than 190 Boots Irish Cancer Society Information Pharmacists and over 60 Boots Cancer Beauty Advisors in stores to help support and advise people living with cancer. Over 2,000 team members have also completed a new e-Learning module, which focuses on the partnership, cancer terminology, the services available at both Boots Ireland and the Irish Cancer Society, and how to support people living with cancer.\n\nThailand\u2019s National Cancer Institute\n(GRI 103-2, 203-1, 413-1)\n\nSince 2016, Boots Thailand has worked in partnership with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to provide underprivileged individuals with specialist cancer care, education and resources. During fiscal 2021, Boots Thailand organized its Let\u2019s Feel Good event for cancer patients at the Boots Thailand support office. The event focused on holistic cancer treatment and featured an art therapy workshop and a knowledge sharing session, to help give patients a greater understanding of how to combine alternative natural treatment, nutritional therapy and mental well-being with conventional cancer care.\n\nAs of Aug. 31, 2021, Boots Thailand has donated an accumulated 1.5 million Thai baht ($48,000) to the National Cancer Institute. Funds raised during fiscal 2021 totaled 1 million Thai baht ($32,000).\nFundaci\u00f3n Alma\n\n(GRI 103-2, 203-1, 413-1)\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, Farmacias Benavides, WBA\u2019s retail pharmacy chain in Mexico, raised more than 258,000 Mexican pesos ($12,600) for Fundaci\u00f3n Alma, a charity that supports uninsured or underinsured women living with cancer through funding for reconstructive surgery, prosthetics, psychological assistance or other aid. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Benavides was not able to participate in its traditional road-race fundraising activities for Fundaci\u00f3n Alma, but adapted by encouraging customers and patients to round up the cost of their purchases and donate the additional amount to the foundation. Customers could also purchase pink reusable bags with profit from those sales going to the foundation.\n\nSince 2014, Farmacias Benavides has raised more than 8 million Mexican pesos ($392,000) for Fundaci\u00f3n Alma. As of August 31, 2021, Benavides has helped fund more than 100 reconstructive surgeries and more than 700 prostheses through its partnership with Fundaci\u00f3n Alma.\n\nFundaci\u00f3n Arturo L\u00f3pez P\u00e9rez and Damas de Caf\u00e9\n\n(GRI 103-2, 203-1, 413-1)\n\nSince 2012, Farmacias Ahumada, WBA\u2019s retail pharmacy chain in Chile, has worked with the Fundaci\u00f3n Arturo L\u00f3pez P\u00e9rez (FALP), a comprehensive cancer diagnosis, treatment, research and teaching center. During fiscal 2021, Ahumada donated 9 million Chilean pesos ($12,150) for the center, which helped support patients who have experienced delays with their cancer treatment due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn recognition of Chile\u2019s Children\u2019s Day on August 8, Ahumada team members also donated toys to the Luis Calvo Mackenna Hospital in Santiago for children who are receiving treatment for cancer. To facilitate the donation, Ahumada\u2019s CSR team partnered with Damas de Caf\u00e9, an all-female volunteer organization dedicated to supporting low-income families who have children diagnosed with cancer.\nGiving Back: Corporate Donations and Supporting Causes\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 201-1, 203-1, 413-1)\n\nThrough corporate donations, fundraising and volunteering, WBA\u2019s businesses and team members give back to the communities where we are proud to operate. By investing in our communities, we maintain trust and support our brands\u2019 reputations.\n\nOur corporate giving strategy is focused on donating to organizations with health programs that align to our core business and CSR priorities, as well as groups that work on social welfare and education issues. The need for product donations is higher than ever, due to COVID-19 as well as to natural disasters and humanitarian crises, many of which are linked to climate change. In fiscal 2021, our donations of products, including hygiene products, personal protective equipment and medical supplies was higher than previously.\n\nThe company has strong processes and policies in place to thoughtfully manage community investments, with an aim to maximize impact. Walgreens uses a community investment management system that aims to ensure best practices, transparency, alignment with business units, compliance and consistent reporting across the organization.\n\nDue to COVID-19, combined with an increased need for testing, our employee volunteering time decreased in fiscal 2021. However, we are as committed as ever to our communities, and many of our team members work on the frontline in their roles. Our team members reported more than 91,571 volunteer hours for fiscal 2021.\n\nAs shown in the charts in this section, the company\u2019s direct contributions totaled $69.3 million in fiscal 2021. Our overall corporate giving increased in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020, mostly due to a donation to the Walgreens Assistance, Inc. Fund. Our accumulated giving for the six-year period from fiscal 2016, the first year that WBA collected company-wide data, totals $231 million. We collect and report community data in line with the model and methodology of Business for Societal Impact (formerly London Benchmarking Group).\n\n1 Fiscal 2019-2020 include Walgreens employee volunteering hours for all activities, with and without a fundraising component. Fiscal 2016-2018 include Walgreens employee volunteering hours for fundraising activities only.\nSupporting causes\n\n(WBA's businesses are proud to support our long-term partner organizations through a number of fundraising campaigns each year. Our businesses, community affairs and corporate responsibility teams, retail pharmacies and business resource groups (BRGs) consult with our community and charity partners when deciding to participate in fundraising.\n\nDuring the pandemic, we continued to step up and work to eradicate the growing health inequities experienced by children, families and underserved communities when they needed it most. In many cases, we adapted our fundraising campaigns and programs so our team members, customers and patients could show their support virtually due to social distancing guidelines.\n\nBelow are details on the amounts raised through some of our most significant campaigns during fiscal 2021:\n\n- **$21 million**\n  - Red Nose Day\n\n- **\u00a3750,000**\n  - (\u20ac1.02 million)\n  - BBC Children in Need\n\n- **$6.8 million**\n  - Local Scannables\n\n- **\u00a3644,000**\n  - (\u20ac877,836)\n  - Macmillan Cancer Support\n\n- **$10.3 million**\n  - LLS and Komen\n\n- **$1.4 million**\n  - LLS Light The Night Walks\n\n- **\u20ac377,000**\n  - (\u20ac451,130)\n  - Irish Cancer Society\n\n- **1.2 million**\n  - Mexican pesos\n  - (\u20ac63,000)\n  - Rosa Fuerte\n\n- **$12.4 million**\n  - Vitamin Angels\n\n- **$100,000**\n  - American Red Cross\nDonations through the myWalgreens app\n\n(GRI 103-2, 103-3, 203-1)\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, Walgreens implemented a new donation tool to help advance the health and well-being of communities across the U.S. and Puerto Rico.\n\nUsing the Walgreens app or online capability on Walgreens.com, customers can donate their Walgreens Cash rewards (loyalty rewards accumulated through Walgreens purchases) to local, regional and national nonprofit organizations. Nearly 600 charities are being supported throughout the U.S. and Puerto Rico at any given time, allowing customers nationwide to have a large-scale impact.\n\nWalgreens features a rotation of different local nonprofit organizations each quarter to customers based on their preferred store location. This empowers customers to support a variety of causes that are making an impact in their communities, as well as understand the important work these nonprofits are doing in their local area.\n\nFrom the launch of the app donation feature in March 2021 and the end of August 2021, more than 45,000 customer and employee myWalgreens members donated close to $200,000 to close to 1,000 charities using the tool.\nDeliver our commitment to equal opportunities and foster a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture for all through strong employment, pay and recruitment practices, policies and procedures.\n\nContinue to improve our robust approach to health, safety and data privacy, actively caring for our employees and customers.\n\nIn this section we report on our progress on the following commitments:\n\n- Proactively support the personal health and well-being of our employees\n- Deliver our commitment to equal opportunities and foster a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture for all through strong employment, pay and recruitment practices, policies and procedures\n- Continue to improve our robust approach to health, safety and data privacy, actively caring for our employees and customers\nFiscal 2021 Healthy and Inclusive Workplace Highlights\n\n**Increased**\n- Proportion of women in leadership roles globally by 2.3 percentage points\n- Utilization of self-paced learning tools by nearly 20,000 employees\n- Unconscious bias training program delivered in 13 languages to more than 91,000 employees\n- Increased proportion of women in leadership roles globally by 2.3 percentage points\n- Increased board diversity\n- Increased U.S. diverse supplier spending, surpassing $500 million goal by $21.5 million\n- Increased people of color in leadership roles in the U.S. by 2.4 percentage points\n- 13 Business Resource Groups (BRGs) with close to a total of 3,700 team members were active throughout Fiscal 2021\n\nWBA published second global DE&I Report\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nOur diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) strategy\n\nGRI 103-1, 103-2\n\nFostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive organization is an essential part of WBA\u2019s business strategy. As a global, pharmacy-led health and beauty company, our vision is to be the leading partner in reimagining local healthcare and well-being for all. With this comes a duty to our team members, patients, customers and communities to be a catalyst for meaningful change. To truly understand and serve our customers and patients, we must reflect them. We are taking bold, intentional actions to drive change in our company by building talented, diverse teams and inclusive brands and services, all while continuously learning.\n\nWith more than 315,000 team members in nine countries, our workplace encompasses a broad range of backgrounds, cultures, experiences, perspectives and insights. It is our responsibility to create an environment where everyone feels respected, valued and empowered to bring their authentic selves to work. We can accomplish this by having DE&I at the center of everything we do.\n\nOur board of directors is deeply engaged on DE&I issues and provides oversight and governance related to our initiatives and public commitments in this area. During 2021, WBA focused on the company-wide advancement of DE&I through evolved leadership accountability, better data and insights, and elevation of our business resource groups (BRGs) to support inclusive business decision making, supplier diversity and ongoing organizational education.\n\nAs a global company, we have deepened our efforts on DE&I outside of the U.S., including a dedicated, senior DE&I professional in our International segment. Additionally, Boots introduced a DE&I Steering Group made up of senior leaders from the UK and Ireland who meet monthly to hold themselves accountable for change. While our strategy is global, our execution is local, and we are empowering our leaders to listen, learn and take meaningful action based on their local cultures, regulations and customers.\n\nGlobal Inclusion Council\n\nGRI 103-2\n\nSince fiscal 2019, our Global Inclusion Council (GIC), made up of 21 leaders from across WBA, has advised on DE&I initiatives, shared local experiences and provided regional ambassadorship for DE&I. GIC members help WBA accelerate the pace and adoption of diverse, equitable and inclusive practices, and provide guidance to execute against our DE&I strategy. During fiscal 2021, the GIC established a supplier diversity subcommittee that is assisting with the international expansion of the supplier diversity program to our Boots UK division.\nLeadership accountability model performance\n\nGRI 103-2, 103-3\n\nTo help deliver on our commitment to foster diverse and inclusive teams, WBA has implemented a leadership accountability program by segment and global function. The program holds leaders responsible for undertaking diversity and inclusion efforts focused on increasing representation of people of color and women within leadership levels.\n\nIn the table to the right are the fiscal 2021 targets, our performance and our commitments to be undertaken in fiscal 2022:\n\n| Target                                                                 | Performance                        | Further action                                                                 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Increase representation of women in leadership roles (senior director or the equivalent, and above) globally by 3 percentage points over the prior year | Increased 2.3 percentage points    | Fiscal 2022 target is for another 3 percentage point increase                  |\n| Increase representation of underrepresented racial and ethnic groups in U.S. leadership roles (senior director or the equivalent, and above) by 2 percentage points over the prior year | Increased 2.4 percentage points    | Fiscal 2022 target is for another 2 percentage point increase. Within that, 1.2 percentage points of the increase must be attributed to the combined representation of Hispanics/Latinos and Blacks / African Americans |\n| Ensure 100 percent compliance of diverse candidate interview slates and interview panels for leadership roles | Achieved targets                   | Fiscal 2022 targets are the same as they were for fiscal 2021                  |\n| Spend $500 million with Tier 1 diverse suppliers in the U.S., an increase of approximately $53 million from the previous year | Supplier diversity spend in fiscal 2021 was $521.5 million | Target to increase supplier diversity spending to $625 million in fiscal 2022 |\nBoard and senior leadership diversity\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, we welcomed Roz Brewer as our new CEO. She is currently one of two African American women CEOs of a Fortune 500 company and her appointment illustrates our promise to seek top talent from underrepresented groups at every level of the company\u2014from the boardroom to the storeroom.\n\nAs of Aug. 31, 2021, the WBA senior management team was comprised of three men and three women, and included three people of color. The WBA board of directors also continued to diversify its ranks during fiscal 2021 and is 75 percent white, 16.7 percent Black or African-American and 8.3 percent Hispanic or Latino. Five of 12 board members are women, and the board also includes LGBTQ+ representation.\n\nReporting\n\nDemonstrating our commitment to transparency and accountability, we published our second global WBA Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Report, covering fiscal years 2020 and 2021. The report can be found on the WBA website.\n\nFurther, for the first time, WBA published our EEO-1 data covering U.S. employees as of the end of calendar 2020. This can be found on our website. The EEO-1 report is a mandatory annual submission to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Large private sector employers are required to submit demographic workforce data, including data by race/ethnicity, sex and job categories. EEOC job categories do not match WBA\u2019s workforce organization, therefore the diversity percentages in the EEO-1 report do not match the diversity data we publish in this report and in our DE&I Report.\n\nIn the UK, our businesses that are subject to the government\u2019s Gender Pay Gap Regulations publish annual reports. During fiscal 2021, Boots UK published its fourth Gender Pay Gap Report, which included actions taken towards further reducing the pay gap, encouraging and supporting female team members across the organization, and inspiring everyone to reach their full potential.\n\nWomen make up more than three quarters of Boots UK\u2019s workforce and as of April 2020, its report showed a median gender pay gap of 2.1 percent. This is an improvement from the previous year\u2019s median pay gap of 3.5 percent and remains significantly better than the median national average of 15.5 percent, which is based on estimates from the Office of National Statistics\u2019 Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings 2020.\n\nBoard and senior leadership diversity disclosure is GRI 405-1 specified disclosure and is within the Deloitte & Touche LLP review scope as detailed on pages 118-119.\nDiversity data\n\n(GRI 102-8, 405-1)\n\nThe following charts and tables show the diversity of our team members globally, and in the U.S.:\n\nDiversity of WBA employees globally as of Aug. 31, 2021\n\n| Employee category | Age group (%) | Gender (%) |\n|-------------------|---------------|------------|\n|                   | All (%)       | <30 | 30-50 | >50 | M | F | UD\u00b2 |\n| Manager\u00b3          | 7             | 10  | 68    | 22  | 45 | 55 | 0   |\n| Non-managers\u00b3     | 93            | 42  | 37    | 20  | 28 | 72 | 0   |\n| All employees     | 100           | 40  | 40    | 20  | 29 | 71 | 0   |\n| Senior director and above\u2074\u2075 | 65 | 35 |\n| Pharmacist        |               | 38  | 62    |     |    |    |     |\n\nRacial and ethnic diversity of employees in our U.S. workforce as of Aug. 31, 2021\n\n| People of color (%) | White (%) | Undisclosed (%) |\n|---------------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Total U.S. workforce\u00b3 | 50        | 49              | 1               |\n| Managers\u00b3           | 32        | 67              | -               |\n| Non-managers\u00b3       | 51        | 48              | 1               |\n| Senior director and above\u2074 | 22 | 78 |\n\nWalgreens specific data\n\nWalgreens pharmacists by gender\n\n- Female: 38%\n- Male: 62%\n\nWalgreens pharmacists by race and ethnicity\n\n- White: 43%\n- People of Color: 56%\n- Undisclosed: 1%\nUnconscious bias to conscious inclusion\nGRI 103-2\nTo help tackle unconscious bias, we deployed a global, company-wide, online Managing Unconscious Bias course. Delivered in 13 languages, the program helps team members reflect on and manage unconscious biases, and gain insights into how bias influences our daily behavior. As of Aug. 31, 2021, more than 91,000 team members completed the training.\n\nFollowing the online course, we developed a Global Inclusion in Action capability program and have started to deploy the leader workshop to our senior leaders internationally. The module facilitates a learning journey of empathy, allyship and championship, covering key topics such as equity and privilege awareness. Team member modules are being developed and will be rolled out in fiscal 2022.\n\nMarketing for Change\nGRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3\nIn response to the global racial equity movement, we introduced Marketing for Change, a permanent action board of diverse global marketers from across Walgreens, Boots UK and No7 Beauty Company dedicated to putting DE&I at the center of our marketing efforts. As a transformational force for change, Marketing for Change focuses on building brands that represent the communities we serve, investing in diverse marketing talent and empowering our organization through education. During fiscal 2021, the board launched and executed a number of strategic DE&I initiatives and deepened WBA\u2019s partnerships with organizations that nurture diverse talent and launched an internal speaker series on the importance of DE&I in marketing.\n\nSupplier diversity\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 413-1)\nWBA set a target for spending with diverse Tier 1 direct suppliers in the U.S. of $500 million in fiscal 2021, an increase of $53 million compared with fiscal 2020. We exceeded our target by more than $21 million. To ensure accountability, we tied this goal to a bonus program, encouraging team members and leaders with purchasing authority and decision influence to consider diverse and small businesses in contracting opportunities.\n\nWorking with business leaders, our supplier diversity program aims to ensure we provide equitable opportunities and source goods and services from enterprises owned by women, people of color, veterans and service-disabled veterans, people with disabilities and LGBTQ+ people, as well as businesses owned by people who are socially or economically disadvantaged. We continue to report increasingly nuanced data within the business to allow us to expand our focus on certain diverse classifications. In fiscal 2021, Walgreens supported more than 570 diverse suppliers.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we further integrated supplier diversity into Walgreens\u2019 procurement and retail products processes and systems. We doubled the number of supplier diversity ambassadors who support and implement our strategy within their respective functions.\n\nWe also work with our Tier 1 suppliers to help them increase utilization of diverse suppliers in their own supply chains. In fiscal 2021, Walgreens continued its partnership with the Women\u2019s Business Development Center, sponsoring the third retail capacity building program. Designed to help minority-owned suppliers grow into the mass retail market, there have been over 70 graduates since the program launch.\n\nProviding leadership opportunities for veterans\nGRI 103-2, 413-1\nSince 2018, the Walgreens Helping Veterans with Educational and Retail Opportunities (HERO) program has been providing career and educational opportunities for U.S. veterans. The program helps veterans transition leadership skills learned through military service into a retail management career through training and on-the-job mentorship.\n\nDespite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 680 shift leads and assistant store manager trainees across the U.S. have been hired into the program as of Aug. 31, 2021. This progresses Walgreens goal to hire 5,000 U.S. veterans to the program within five years from launch.\nHelping young people from all backgrounds gain professional experience\n\nGRI 103-1, 103-2, 413-1\n\nWBA partners with numerous organizations, schools and universities to help provide meaningful job opportunities for young people and to support pharmacy training for students from diverse backgrounds. Young people are the future and essential to the continued transformation and growth of our company.\n\nThe following are examples of some of these training and scholarship programs:\n\nWalgreens diversity donation\nDuring fiscal 2021, Walgreens awarded close to $1 million in scholarships for pharmacy students for the 2021-2022 school year. The goal of the Walgreens Diversity Donation is to increase the enrollment of underrepresented students in schools and colleges of pharmacy, and to promote diversity and inclusion within institutional culture.\n\nBoots UK and The Prince's Trust\nSince 2019, Boots UK has worked in partnership with The Prince's Trust with the intention of empowering the next generation. Together, they help support young people in communities across the UK to get into work by providing accessible, inclusive and meaningful opportunities that help young people develop their skills, confidence and self-esteem, regardless of background. Read more about how Boots UK supports youth employment in the Employee Health and Well-being section of this report.\n\nSkills for Chicagoland\u2019s Future\nFor the seventh year, Walgreens continued to support Skills for Chicagoland\u2019s Future, a nonprofit organization helping to tackle unemployment in Walgreens\u2019 home city of Chicago. As part of its partnership, Walgreens has committed to providing youths from 18 to 26 years old from low-income, high-risk neighborhoods with long-term skills and tools to grow their careers.\n\nAs of Aug. 31, 2021, Walgreens has hired more than 200 people in various store positions across the Chicago area through the partnership. This includes a number of pharmacy technicians that Walgreens helped to train and mentor for a career path in retail management through the Skills\u2019 Beyond the Diploma: Pivot to Success program.\nBusiness Resource Groups (BRGs)\n\nGRI 103-2\n\nOur 22 Business Resource Groups (BRGs) and chapters are helping team members meet at the corner of inclusion, community, education and engagement. Formed and led by volunteer team members, our BRGs represent a dimension of diversity that encompasses age, gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identity, disability and military veteran status, as well as environmental sustainability.\n\nNot only do our BRGs help our people build connections with those with similar interests, background and experiences, but they also enable members to learn, collaborate and demonstrate leadership skills.\n\nWith close to 3,700 members in the U.S., UK, Germany and Asia as of Aug. 31, 2021, our BRGs help WBA connect more closely to the multicultural and multifaceted communities we serve. As the everyday champions driving real change, they help advance a culture of inclusion at WBA, while supporting and aligning with business imperatives.\nTackling health inequities and racism\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate effect on Black, Hispanic and Indigenous communities, and has amplified how systemic racism has led to health disparities in communities of color. While we intensified our efforts to improve healthcare access and equity during the global crisis, our BRGs also took meaningful action:\n\n- Our African-American Leadership (AAL) and Women of WBA - U.S. BRGs hosted an intersectional panel on vaccine hesitancy in Black and Brown communities. The Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) BRG in the UK organized a similar event.\n- Our AAL, AsianConnect, Shades of the World and MOSAIC BRGs hosted a collaborative discussion about racial inequity and mental health.\n- In the midst of the \"Stop Asian Hate\" movement, our AsianConnect BRG sponsored a panel discussion to raise awareness about increasing violence against Asian communities and ways to extend allyship to our Asian team members and friends.\n\nIncreasing understanding\n\nAs an essential element of our WBA community, our BRG leaders and members provided a number of opportunities for their peers to share their experiences, while broadening their networks and perspectives and building a true sense of community.\n\n- Our Pride Alliance BRG hosted a session to help team members understand the language used to define gender and sexual identities in the LGBTQ+ community.\n- Helping to provide a first-hand view of the experiences of individuals attempting to immigrate to the U.S for asylum, our Latino Professional BRG sponsored an educational program: Immigration at the Border.\n- With many team members managing their own health conditions and disabilities, our disAbility Alliance BRG hosted virtual networking sessions on disability topics for team members to share their personal journeys and learn about different conditions.\n- To celebrate World Environment Day, our Environmental Sustainability BRGs came together to discuss sustainability across the U.S., UK and Asia.\n- The Women of WBA BRGs implemented seven-week, self-guided Learning Journeys covering career defining hurdles, including developing your personal brand, building confidence and improving negotiation skills. Additionally, the Women of WBA-UK launched Lean In Circles, where small groups of women mentor and inspire one another, share skills and experiences, and celebrate each other\u2019s successes.\nWalgreens has continued to build on its long-standing partnership with the nonprofit Skills for Chicagoland\u2019s Future that aims to address hiring disparities and barriers to employment in Walgreens\u2019 home city of Chicago. At a time when the pandemic caused more than 400,000 people in Illinois to lose their jobs in 2020, its mission \u2014 to get unemployed and underemployed Chicagoland residents back to work \u2014 has never felt more important.\n\nPartnering for a seventh year with the nonprofit, Walgreens is helping to build bridges between job candidates and employers in a city where unemployment in some neighborhoods is as high as 30 percent \u2013 well above the national average. As part of its partnership, Walgreens has committed to providing youths from 18 to 26 years old from low-income, high-risk neighborhoods with long-term skills and tools to grow their careers. As of Aug. 31, 2021, Walgreens has hired more than 200 people in various store positions across the Chicago area through the partnership. This includes a number of pharmacy technicians Walgreens helped to train and mentor for a career path in retail management, through Skills\u2019 Beyond the Diploma: Pivot to Success program.\n\n\u201cI always wanted to work in a pharmacy so I applied for the Walgreens position. The Skills program helped with my resume and the interview process - it prepared me for my job,\u201d said Janesha Blakeley, RxTech at Walgreens. As the pandemic\u2019s economic impact is expected to have far-reaching impacts, Walgreens is committed to continuing to collaborate with like-minded partners like Skills for Chicagoland\u2019s Future to accelerate economic mobility for unemployed and underemployed job seekers.\nEmployee Health and Well-being\n\nEmployee health and benefits\n\nAt WBA, our brand heritage is built on improving the health and well-being of our communities. To fulfill that purpose, we must start by supporting the health and well-being of our employees, as they are also members of our communities and directly influence our ability to care for customers. All of WBA's businesses manage benefits and, where applicable, healthcare for employees at the national level, as laws and regulations vary by geography. Here, we cover our two largest employers: U.S.-based Walgreens and Boots UK, which together account for more than 94 percent of our 315,000 direct employees across retail locations, support offices, fulfillment centers, opticians business, and related roles.\n\nOur businesses continuously evaluate their wellness offerings through measurement of utilization, competitive benchmarking and bi-annual employee surveys. Employees enrolled in a Walgreens medical plan are offered access to a newly integrated digital platform combining the 365 Get Healthy Here wellness program and Life365 employee assistance program. Through the platform, Walgreens awarded myWalgreens cash, $0 Rx Copay, Quit Tobacco support program, up to five free counseling sessions, tracking tools for personal health goals, and more. Dependents of those enrolled in the plan also receive access to select benefits.\n\nPart-time U.S. Walgreens employees are eligible for a number of benefits including 401(k) employer match, Prescription Savings Club, annual flu shots, 365 Get Healthy Here, Life365 employee assistance program, the PerkSpot employee discount program and others.\n\nBoots UK offers a comprehensive range of benefits to full- and part-time employees. Using a flexible program, employees personalize benefits across health and well-being, travel, lifestyle and financial categories. In addition to insurance and time off, Boots UK provides benefits such as an employee assistance program, loyalty awards, pension programs and an employee discount.\n\nSupporting employees in crisis\n\nCOVID-19 continues to impact the way we work and live. During fiscal 2021, as government restrictions loosened and more people returned to work, Boots provided a framework to line managers to evaluate risk for vulnerable employees, provide necessary accommodations and engage in proactive, compassionate conversations with employees determined to be high-risk. Line managers were provided with detailed guidance and resources on managing specific COVID-19 related situations. Walgreens held Team Talks to guide managers and directed team members to resources on a specific COVID-19 information section on the company intranet.\n\nWe also recognize that many crises have financial impacts. Further, supporting employees' financial health greatly impacts their overall well-being, from mitigating stress to enabling healthy choices. Between the pandemic and compounding crisis of climate change and related natural disasters, our employee financial assistance programs were especially essential in fiscal 2021.\n\nThe Walgreen Benefit Fund in the U.S. and the Boots Benevolent Fund in the UK - both funded by charitable donations - assist current employees and retirees experiencing financial hardship.\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, the U.S. team provided $1.2 million in aid to over 1,000 applicants. The UK fund supported 150 employees with more than \u00a3130,000 ($172,000) in grants as of August 31, 2021. The Boots Benevolent Fund also committed to increasing the percentage of team members supported financially from 0.33 percent to 1 percent over a 5-year period beginning in fiscal 2021.\n\nSeparately, our businesses quickly mobilized to provide disaster relief to impacted team members. For more than 20 employees in Veracruz, Mexico who lost their homes to Hurricane Grace, Farmacias Benavides provided payments of 10,000 Mexican pesos ($491) each and allowed all employees to donate through payroll, raising more than 160,000 Mexican pesos ($7,859) in additional funds.\n\nWhen Germany was devastated by floods, Alliance Healthcare Deutschland GmbH and GEHE Pharma Handel GmbH initiated a local donation program for employees to contribute to the charitable organization, Aktion Deutschland Hilft e.V (Germany's Relief Coalition), supporting flood victims. The business offered to match employee contributions, leading to a total of \u20ac25,000 ($28,372) in donations.\nMental health support for employees\n(GRI 103-2, 103-3, 403-5, 403-6)\n\nAt WBA we take a holistic approach to wellness by focusing on the physical, financial and emotional well-being of our teammates. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated issues within each of these categories, and dramatically impacted mental health, leading us to amplify our existing mental and behavioral health offerings.\n\nBoth Walgreens and Boots UK continued to put emphasis on building specialized expertise around mental health through expansion of Mental Health First Aid Training. The Walgreens program, in partnership with the National Council for Behavioral Health and American Pharmacists Association (APhA), committed to train select team members - including more than 300 human resources partners - to help them better assist employees in crisis and non-crisis situations. This builds on the mental health services offered through Walgreens medical plans and the allotment of behavioral health visits team members and their families can use at no cost. In fiscal 2021, Boots also expanded Mental Health First Aider training to critical roles such as the pharmacy help desk.\n\nTo promote personal well-being and drive team members to mental health resources, the company engaged employees in awareness and prevention moments throughout the year. Additionally, we responded to increased employee interest in mental health topics by providing skills-based webinars and presentations in partnership with LifeWorks, our employee assistance partner, and Colleague Health, Boots UK\u2019s occupational health provider.\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, Walgreens integrated its 365 Get Healthy Here and Life365 platforms to create a comprehensive site for employee health and well-being. By combining the employee assistance platform with the well-being site, Walgreens reduced hesitancy and stigma associated with seeking out mental health assistance. The platform integration emphasized social connectedness during the COVID-19 era with opportunities to share gratitude, offer encouragement, award recognition and upload photos.\n\nThe Boots UK well-being steering group pulls representatives from across the business to manage the structure of employee health and well-being initiatives focused on leadership, management capability, specialist support, personal well-being and design of work.\n\nTo equip leaders with the skills and resources to confidently care for employees, during fiscal 2021 Boots embedded well-being topics into learning and development programs for all employee levels and launched a Care-led Leadership Podcast Series. In July, 133 senior leaders participated in seven virtual sessions to help strengthen their mental health awareness skills. Newly appointed leaders underwent training where building mentally healthy workplaces was a key topic.\n\nFor all employees, Boots offered the HUG Inspire program to promote initiating well-being conversations with team members using the business\u2019 newly accredited customer care training model, HUG (Hello, Understand, Go the Extra Mile). More than 33,000 employees took the core module between May and July 2021.\n\nBoots UK leverages data on workplace absence, health referrals, employee survey results, program engagement and other factors to measure success of wellness initiatives.\n\nFreedom of association and collective bargaining agreements\n(GRI 102-41)\n\nWBA respects and upholds the right of workers in conformity with local law to be members of trade unions of their own choosing and to bargain collectively, in accordance with the appropriate local laws.\n\nAll WBA segments, businesses and the corporate functions are required to keep up-to-date written policies defining the rights of each employee to trade union membership where statutorily or legally required, according to our internal human resources policy.\n\nAs of Aug. 31, 2021, 7.5 percent of our employees across the globe were covered by collective bargaining agreements.\nEmployee training and development, and human capital management\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 404-1, 404-2)\n\nLearning and development are key to supporting employee fulfillment. We also recognize that growth and diversification of roles directly benefits our company and encourages retention through visible career paths. We extend training opportunities across our organization, through community development programs and apprenticeships. During fiscal 2021, our full-time equivalent employees received an average of 32.28 hours of training per person.\n\nOur internal functions and community organizations work collaboratively in aligning business needs with gaps in the workforce to upskill existing and potential employees in topics from specialist areas to soft skills. Essential training is integrated into WBA onboarding and personalized for individual roles. We collect quantitative and qualitative feedback on program success through completion rates, reflection surveys, retention and knowledge checks. WBA has also integrated learning and development into the company\u2019s performance management, evaluating employees annually (at a minimum) according to a purpose-led model.\n\nTo help develop leaders, Walgreens continued to grow programs focused on identifying talent and coaching leaders to reach the next level of management. This includes:\n\n- Walgreens Leader Essentials program - with more than 10,200 participants - expanded in fiscal 2021 to train new people managers in support office and field roles;\n- The EDGE program - with 116 completions - to build executive presence, business acumen and diverse networks among high-potential leaders; and\n- The Launch Forward Program - for high-potential leaders is in its second year - to enhance leadership development through mentoring circles led by executive leadership.\n\nFor all employees, Walgreens renewed its micro-learning tool, which offers bite-sized, on-demand learning resources. Fiscal 2021 saw a significant increase in use, with more than 27,000 employees engaging with self-paced learning tools.\n\nWalgreens University continued to offer training, leadership development and career advancement programs to employees at all levels. In fiscal 2021, Walgreens expanded the number of virtual trainings, opening up courses to a more inclusive geographic audience \u2013 not just those near Walgreens campuses. During the fiscal year, more than 2,000 employees participated in both in-person and live virtual sessions for skills development, an increase of roughly 400 from the previous year. Walgreens University also partners with academic institutions to offer tuition discounts to employees. Since launching the partnership in 2013, Walgreens University has provided employees with more than $9 million in tuition discounts.\n\nIn addition to continuing Walgreens accredited Pharmacy Technician Training apprenticeship program, the business launched the Front-End program, which gives store managers an abbreviated, customized program that allows them to sit for the Pharmacy Technician Certification Exam.\n\nBoots launched a management capability drive in fiscal 2021. Guided by the results of WBA\u2019s annual employee survey, the program offered a series of leader development modules to assist managers in leading change, building team resilience and strengthening communication skills. Professional development modules were personalized across roles in pharmacy, opticians, beauty, leadership, retail and support office.\n\nBoots also advanced programs for young people and new professionals. The business continued to offer summer pharmacy placements for third-year MPharm students and foundation training roles offering a structured, year-long learning experience for trainee pharmacists. As part of Boots UK\u2019s award-winning apprenticeship program, in fiscal 2021 the business offered more than 600 apprenticeship opportunities, far exceeding the goal of 400.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, Boots UK partnered with The Prince\u2019s Trust to support the Kickstart program for 16 to 24-year-olds currently on Universal Credit and at risk of long-term unemployment. The business offered six-month paid placements to 55 young people, giving them the skills and experience to jumpstart their careers. Also through partnership with the Prince\u2019s Trust, Boots engaged in the World of Work and Million Makers programs, which provide employability training and funding resources for young people with business ideas.\nEmployee engagement and retention\n\n(GRI 103-2, 103-3, 202-1)\n\nWe understand listening to our employees is the most effective way to foster a great place to work \u2013 which translates directly to our business success. Since September 2019, WBA has conducted a bi-annual global employee engagement survey, Our Voice: Our Future. Results from the survey are taken seriously by the leadership team, which collectively commits to responding and taking action.\n\nTo maintain the ability of WBA to attract and retain talent, the compensation department conducts an annual pay analysis against key roles. For high-performing pharmacy technicians, Walgreens invests further to ensure compensation reflects our commitment to outstanding employees, offering pay increases to the midpoint of an employee\u2019s pay range by market.\n\nAt the end of fiscal 2021, Walgreens announced it will increase starting hourly wage for all team members to $15, with implementation taking place in phases before November 2022. To further recognize team members, the business awarded pharmacists a one-time bonus of $1,250 for full-time and $1,000 for part-time employees. Additionally, pharmacy technicians who are certified or become certified to administer flu and COVID-19 vaccines will receive a $1,000 reward throughout a six-month retention period.\n\nIn April of 2021, Boots UK applied the national minimum wage increase to its payroll, offering a base pay that remains more than 5 percent above the national requirement. Approximately two-thirds of the Boots UK workforce saw a pay increase of 2 percent or more from the adjustment.\nEmployee data\n\n(GRI 102-8)\n\nThe tables show our employees by employment type and our employee turnover rate:\n\nEmployees by gender and employment type\\(^1, 2\\) as of Aug. 31, 2021\n\n| Employment type | All (%) | Permanent (%) | Temporary (%) | Part-time (%) | Full-time (%) |\n|-----------------|---------|---------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Male            | 29      | 29            | 28            | 24           | 32           |\n| Female          | 71      | 71            | 72            | 76           | 68           |\n| Undisclosed\\(^3\\) | 0       | 0             | 0             | 0            | 0            |\n| All employees   | 100     | 100           | 100           | 100          | 100          |\n\nEmployee Turnover\\(^4, 5\\) within FY21\n\n|                      | Voluntary Turnover (%) | Involuntary Turnover (%) | Total Employee Turnover (%) |\n|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| United States        | 43                     | 7                        | 50                          |\n| International\\(^6\\)  | 27                     | 3                        | 30                          |\n| WBA                  | 40                     | 6                        | 47                          |\n\n\\(^1\\) Employees of fully owned WBA businesses; does not include employees of companies in which WBA has equity method investments.\n\n\\(^2\\) Does not include contractors because they are not included in our employee figures.

We are committed to:\n\n- Reduce energy consumption and emissions\n- Reduce waste, increasing re-use and recycling and collaborating to help create an increasingly circular economy\n\nHealthy Planet\nFiscal 2021 Healthy Planet Highlights\n\nWBA announced its first enterprise-wide, global carbon emissions reduction target: 30% decrease in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by fiscal 2030 vs fiscal 2019.\n\nWBA carbon emissions down 14.9 percent in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2019.\n\nWBA recycling rates: approximately 60 percent recycled, up 6 percentage points from our baseline year of fiscal 2019.\n\nWBA began reporting against the Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations with intent to implement a robust climate scenario analysis.\n\nFor the third year in a row, less than 1 percent of Boots UK waste went to landfill.\n\nOur Liz Earle Beauty Company skincare brand became a certified CarbonNeutral company and its Holiday 21 gifting range also achieved certified CarbonNeutral product certification.\n\n6.3% of energy consumed across WBA was from renewable sources.\nEnergy and Emissions\n\nOur carbon emissions target\n\nAt WBA, we believe climate change is caused by human activities and poses an imminent threat to human health and the health of our planet. We are acutely aware of climate-related impacts to our communities and our global community, including disasters such as wild-fires and floods, along with other impacts. We are also committed to actively expanding our understanding of climate-related risks and opportunities. Our climate is in crisis and requires swift action by corporations to do our part in reducing our footprint.\n\nWith this in mind, WBA set its first global emissions reduction target, committing to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 30 percent by the end of fiscal 2030 compared with our baseline year of fiscal 2019. The development of this goal was informed and guided by science-based methodology and builds on ongoing work by our businesses to reduce emissions.\n\nWe plan to achieve our emissions reduction target primarily through a continued focus on energy efficiency at Walgreens, our largest business entity, with nearly 9,000 retail pharmacy locations across the U.S. and in Puerto Rico. Walgreens will continue to invest in energy efficiency projects and energy management systems.\n\nBoots UK will likewise continue energy efficiency programs and aims to eliminate the use of natural gas in new locations. While Walgreens and Boots operations represent more than 90 percent of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon footprint, our other businesses will also continue to contribute to efforts to reduce emissions.\n\nIn the first two years of the goal, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 we have achieved a carbon emissions reduction of (8.3)% and (14.9)% respectively, compared with the baseline year. Details are provided in the progress section below. Given this significant progress, we expect to continue reviewing and revising our target to make sure it remains relevant.\n\nSupporting the UK\u2019s wider net zero transition, Boots UK previously pledged to collaborate with other UK retailers on a roadmap for the industry to achieve complete net zero emissions by 2040, including net zero Scope 2 emissions by 2030 and Scope 1 by 2035. The 77 retailers who are signatories to the British Retail Consortium\u2019s Climate Change Statement are focused on five key pathways: greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy, sustainable sourcing, colleague interaction and low carbon logistics.\n\nOur beauty brands are also working to address this issue. The No7 Beauty Company was launched in fiscal 2021 with broad sustainability goals. Within the No7 Beauty company portfolio, the Liz Earle Beauty Company skincare brand became a certified CarbonNeutral company, having evaluated and reduced the carbon footprint of its business operations and offsetting its remaining carbon emissions. In addition, its holiday 2021 gifts are all certified as CarbonNeutral products.\nClimate reporting\n\nAs we continue to participate in the broader global effort to manage environmental impact across sectors and industries, we recognize the nature of climate reporting is evolving. Investors, regulators and consumers are requesting comprehensive disclosures and transparency around how companies manage their impact.\n\nAt WBA, we see this as a good and necessary step in driving accountability and action against the climate crisis. In fiscal 2021, Walgreens engaged on this issue directly by joining the Retail Industry Leaders Association\u2019s (RILA) public comment to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to inform potential mandatory climate reporting.\n\nTo answer these expectations, our company is expanding disclosures on how it is managing climate change risks and opportunities. Our fiscal 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K includes a discussion of climate change risk. Additionally, in this ESG Report we are for the first time reporting against the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. To meet these guidelines, we are actively analyzing scenarios to identify and assess climate-related risks and opportunities, as well as evolving our governance, strategy, risk management, metrics and targets accordingly. This includes beginning a climate scenario analysis, the results of which will be reported in our fiscal 2022 report.\n\nWBA continues to submit climate change disclosures to CDP on an annual basis. The company received a score of B- during fiscal 2021 on its CDP submission, slightly lower than our previous score in fiscal 2020 of B. CDP submissions in the climate category are rated on a scale of A to D- for completeness, assessment of environmental issues and risks and the extent to which a company has implemented actions, policies and strategies to address these. We anticipate a more favorable score in future submissions due to the inclusion of our long-term carbon reduction target and completion of a Carbon Scenario Analysis, which were not yet public at the time of the CDP submission.\n\nOur progress\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-3, 305-1, 305-5)\n(SASB HC-DR-130a.1)\n\nMost of our Scope 1 emissions - directly from sources controlled by the company - and Scope 2 emissions - resulting from purchased electricity, heat and steam consumed by the company - are related to energy use for light and heating. We also report business travel and downstream transportation and distribution categories in our management of Scope 3 emissions - indirect emissions that are a consequence of company activities but occur from sources not owned or controlled by the company.\n\nIn fiscal 2021 WBA\u2019s total carbon footprint based on our stated scope on page 70 was 1.7 million metric tonnes of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent), down 14.9 percent from our baseline year of fiscal 2019, mainly due to our energy efficiency projects in U.S. retail pharmacy locations and to the increased proportions of energy from renewable sources in the power grids on which we purchase.\n\nOf the fiscal 2021 emissions, 88 percent were from energy - including 89 percent electricity and 10 percent natural gas within energy emissions. Separately, 11 percent were from product delivery and the remaining 1 percent from business travel.\nEmissions Data\n\n(GRI 305-1, 305-2, 305-3)\n(SASB HC-DR-130a \u00a7)\n\nTotal company CO\u2082e emissions by source\u00b9\n(000 metric tonnes)\n\n| Source          | Fiscal 2021 | Fiscal 2020 | Fiscal 2019 | % change from fiscal 2019 |\n|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------------|\n| Energy          | 1,505       | 1,629       | 1,781       | -15.5                    |\n| Product Delivery| 184         | 179         | 180         | 2.2                      |\n| Business Travel | 15          | 28          | 42          | -63.6                    |\n| **Total**       | **1,704**   | **1,836**   | **2,002**   | **-14.9**                |\n\nCO\u2082e emissions by source, fiscal 2021\u00b9\n\n- Energy: 11%\n- Product Delivery: 88%\n- Business Travel: 1%\n\nCO\u2082e emissions from energy, by type\u00b9 (000 metric tonnes)\n\n| Type       | Fiscal 2021 | Fiscal 2020 | Fiscal 2019 | % change from fiscal 2019 |\n|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------------|\n| Electricity| 1,336       | 1,493       | 1,631       | -18.1                    |\n| Gas        | 151         | 121         | 133         | 13.5                     |\n| Other      | 18          | 15          | 17          | 5.9                      |\n| **Total**  | **1,505**   | **1,629**   | **1,781**   | **-15.5**                |\n\nCO\u2082e emissions by Scope\u00b9,\u00b2 (000 metric tonnes)\n\n| Scope       | Fiscal 2021 | Fiscal 2020 | Fiscal 2019 | % change from fiscal 2019 |\n|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------------|\n| Scope 1 Emissions | 325         | 301         | 313         | 4                        |\n| Scope 2 Emissions | 1,324       | 1,480       | 1,617       | -18.1                    |\n| Scope 3 Emissions | 56          | 56          | 73          | -23.3                    |\n| **Total**   | **1,704**   | **1,836**   | **2,002**   | **-14.9**                |\n\nCO\u2082e emissions from business travel (metric tonnes)\nper thousand employees, by segment and for the company\u00b3\n\n| Segment       | Fiscal 2021 | Fiscal 2020 | Fiscal 2019 | % change from fiscal 2019 |\n|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------------|\n| United States | 38          | 81          | 108         | -64.8                    |\n| International | 81          | 119         | 204         | -60.3                    |\n| **Total**     | **48**      | **78**      | **157**     | **-69.4**                |\n\n\u00b9Fiscal 2021 data is a WBA specified disclosure and is within the Deloitte & Touche LLP review scope as detailed on pages 118-119.\n\u00b2Scope 1 emissions include those resulting from heat and electricity produced by our on-site plant in Beeston, Nottingham, UK, except for the portion sold to third parties or to the grid, which was 14,000 metric tonnes in fiscal 2021, and 33,000 metric tonnes in fiscal 2020 and 32,000 metric tonnes in fiscal 2019. Scope 2 emissions calculated using a market-based method were 1,277,000 metric tonnes in fiscal 2021, and 1,427,000 metric tonnes in fiscal 2020 and 1,556,000 metric tonnes in fiscal 2019. WBA currently reports on business travel and downstream transportation and distribution Scope 3 emissions. Scope 1, 2, and 3 as defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n\u00b3Scope 3 emissions include those resulting from heat and electricity produced by our on-site plant in Beeston, Nottingham, UK, except for the portion sold to third parties or to the grid, which was 14,000 metric tonnes in fiscal 2021, and 33,000 metric tonnes in fiscal 2020 and 32,000 metric tonnes in fiscal 2019. Scope 2 emissions calculated using a market-based method were 1,277,000 metric tonnes in fiscal 2021, and 1,427,000 metric tonnes in fiscal 2020 and 1,556,000 metric tonnes in fiscal 2019. WBA currently reports on business travel and downstream transportation and distribution Scope 3 emissions. Scope 1, 2, and 3 as defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\nManaging energy use\n\n(GRI 103-2, 103-3, 302-4)\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, WBA focused efforts on better understanding areas of risk and opportunity by closely monitoring energy efficiency performance for each business on weekly, monthly and annual cadences.\n\nAs energy accounts for most of our emissions, we work to improve efficiency and reduce our overall carbon footprint through management of equipment and systems across retail locations, distribution centers and fleets. WBA\u2019s businesses invest in energy-efficient lighting, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) units and refrigerators, engage and educate employees around energy consumption, invest in photovoltaic systems, use alternative energy management programs and participate in demand-response curtailment programs during peak periods.\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, Walgreens continued rolling out a robust energy management system (EMS) to monitor optimal performance of devices and provide initial insight into climate-stressed locations. These EMS installations \u2013 now in 2,500 retail pharmacies with the goal to expand across our U.S. retail locations over the next three years \u2013 complement years of progress installing more energy-efficient indoor and outdoor lighting and HVAC units.\n\nWalgreens LED Initiative was formally recognized during the 2021 Illuminating Engineering Annual Conference for piloting the Connected Life Safety and Basket Tagging projects, which qualified for the \u2018Other Integrated Systems and Lighting\u2019 category. In addition to the energy savings delivered through the conversion of fluorescent fixtures to LED, advanced controls enabled dimming to achieve proper light levels and daylight harvesting for fixtures near windows and doors.\n\nBoots UK also continued installation of metering systems for more accurate weekly and monthly consumption, completing an additional 357 store installations in fiscal 2021.\n\nIn addition to managing energy in our stores, distribution centers within our Walgreens business in California have enrolled in the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) energy program. The rebate structure improves technology for operations machinery including forklift trucks, pallet jacks and pickers to help reduce GHG emissions and improve air quality.\n\nResponding to climate events\n\n(GRI 103-2)\n\nWith a large retail footprint, we understand our role and responsibility in managing energy use within our communities, particularly amid increased extreme weather and climate events. Due to Walgreens rollout of its advanced EMS, the business was able to double the size of its demand response program during fiscal 2021. Walgreens assisted in demand reduction to reduce stress on the grid, preventing potential blackout situations during wildfires in California, and worked with local utilities to get water to communities without power after storms.\n\nAs a company providing essential services, WBA is also responsible for ensuring the resiliency of our operations in climate-stressed environments. The business deployed generators and rehabbed uninterruptible power systems in communities in California and Puerto Rico to ensure sustained power supply. In Florida, Walgreens improved retail store infrastructure to withstand severe storms.\n\nRenewable energy\n\n(GRI 302-1)\n\nWhere strategically feasible, WBA looks to power our operations through certified renewable energy from wind, solar or hydro. During fiscal 2021, 6.3 percent of electricity consumed across WBA was from renewable sources. In the Republic of Ireland, 100 percent of our Boots stores are powered by certified renewable energy and in the UK, 98 percent of our stores are certified renewable.\n\nWalgreens is revisiting its solar strategy in the coming years. Currently, rooftop solar panels are installed at 240 stores.\n\nAdditionally, as part of the leadership agenda, our Walgreens business works with utilities to help them understand their environmental impact and influence a cleaner marketplace.\nFleet efficiency and electric vehicle charging points\n\nWBA fiscal 2021 emissions from product delivery increased by 2.2 percent compared with our baseline year of fiscal 2019, and business travel emissions decreased 63.6 percent in the same period primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 on travel.\n\nTo improve fleet efficiency, Boots UK outsourced delivery systems to be managed by Alliance Healthcare logistics operations. Through Alliance Healthcare, Boots will introduce additional alternative fuel trials and collaborate with vehicle manufacturers on this exploration. Also during fiscal 2021, Boots UK began replacing its trailers with the goal to complete 152 updates over three years. The new trailers allow for increased capacity, meaning fewer vehicles, decreased maintenance and less tire rubber.\n\nThe Walgreens truck fleet has participated since 2005 in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s SmartWay Program, which helps measure fuel efficiency in the fleet and understand the supply chain\u2019s total impact on the environment. The Walgreens fleet improved fuel efficiency by 2.6 CO\u2082 grams per mile in calendar 2020 compared with calendar 2019. In fiscal 2021, Walgreens began optimizing its routes for a reduction in overall miles. The business also continued to test and implement new technologies to increase aerodynamics and fuel efficiency, including adjusting gear ratios on freightliner trucks, resulting in a projected .9 percent fuel savings.\n\nIn addition to managing emissions in its own fleet, Walgreens currently offers customers 541 electric vehicle charging stations across 412 stores. In partnership with Volta, the business plans to significantly expand the number of charging stations offered in 2022.\n\nCarbon-footprint related initiatives in Mexico\n\nFarmacias Benavides is involved in a number of environmental initiatives related to reducing or offsetting carbon emissions, including working with Reforestaci\u00f3n Extrema to plant 200 trees since fiscal 2019, renovating air conditioning equipment at 140 pharmacies, sponsoring a shared bicycle program and diverting milk formula waste from landfill to be used in the production of animal feed.\nWaste and Plastics\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 306-1, 306-2, 306-3, 306-4, 306-5, 308-1)\n\nWaste management is an important issue for WBA and our stakeholders, who expect that we do what is reasonably within our control to avoid waste associated with our operations and to minimize any adverse impacts of waste through responsible management and increasing circular economies. WBA continues to make our business more sustainable by rethinking designs, reducing consumption, recycling, composting, re-using materials and global measurement of our waste generation and disposal.\n\nThis section of our report covers waste management, waste reduction and recycling efforts, zero waste to landfill programs in certain areas of operation and efforts to reduce the negative impact of plastic waste in our retail stores and distribution operations. Our work on plastic packaging in our owned brands is covered in the Packaging, Labeling and Transparency section of this report, under Sustainable Marketplace.\n\nWaste is a local issue and as such, it is managed differently across geographies to enhance positive impacts. In the UK, the government-backed waste hierarchy provides a framework that promotes waste avoidance, recycling and recovery methods over disposal in landfill. Boots UK also engages environmental management systems and standards to drive a culture of zero waste by effectively managing all unique types of waste. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Non-Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Hierarchy is used to ensure proper approaches are taken to different kinds of waste. Across the world, WBA\u2019s businesses engage with various vendor partners to help ensure best practices are used when disposing of waste.\n\nCollaboration with and feedback from industry groups is key to resolving waste issues, especially due to continued uncertainties in the global recycling market. Through organizations such as the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA) in the U.S., Walgreens is supporting efforts to increase recycling and re-use in the retail industry. Walgreens is a member of the RILA Sustainability and Zero Waste Committees that promote collaboration on key issues such as energy use, greenhouse gas emissions reduction, waste generation reduction and the circular economy.\n\nAnother example of our collaboration on waste reduction efforts is WBA\u2019s continued sponsorship of and participation in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation\u2019s Beyond 34: Scaling Circularity for a Sustainable Economy, which aims to improve low U.S. municipal recycling rates.\n\nEmployee training and engagement is key to further progress on our environmental targets. More than 14,000 Boots UK employees have completed the Boots Environmental Experts (BEE) online training since it was introduced in fiscal 2020. At Walgreens, our CSR Champions are provided with information on active waste-related programs such as zero waste to landfill and Beyond the Bag in addition to their CSR training module courses, which include waste.\nWaste data\n(GRI 306-3, 306-4, 306-5)\n\nAcross all of its businesses, WBA generated 619,000 metric tonnes of waste in fiscal 2021, decrease of 8 percent from the baseline year of fiscal 2019, primarily due to waste reduction programs at Walgreens.\n\nWaste by method of disposal\n(000 metric tonnes)\n\n|                | Fiscal 2021 | Fiscal 2020 | Fiscal 2019 | % change from fiscal 2019 |\n|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------------|\n| Landfill       | 247         | 261         | 307         | -19.5%                   |\n| Incinerated2   | -           | -           | -           | Not applicable           |\n| Recycled3      | 372         | 345         | 369         | 0.8%                     |\n|                | 619         | 606         | 676         | -8.4%                    |\n\nIn fiscal 2021 WBA was responsible for 619 metric tonnes of waste, a reduction of 8.4 percent from our baseline year of fiscal 2019. Waste sent to landfill was 247 metric tonnes, a reduction of 19.5 percent and recycling increased from 369 to 372 metric tonnes or 0.8 percent.\n\nThe fiscal 2021 recycling rates at our segments were as follows:\n\n- United States segment 59 percent\n- International segment 74 percent\n\nAdditionally, 100 percent of all waste diverted and directed to disposal, is handled off-site.\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, less than 1 percent of the total waste generated by WBA was considered hazardous, and of that, 57 percent was recycled, 34 percent was incinerated and 9 percent went to appropriate landfills in accordance with federal, state and local regulations.\n\nDiverting and reducing waste\n(GRI 103-2, 103-3, 306-1, 306-2, 308-1)\n\nWBA businesses continue to divert and reduce waste through a number of ongoing programs, as well as new initiatives, in fiscal 2021.\n\nThe Walgreens support center and WBA global headquarters in Deerfield, Illinois implemented a zero waste to landfill program. This included modernization and simplification of waste disposal equipment, partnership with a waste-to-energy partner and new signage on recycling, composting and waste containers to help employees dispose of items properly.\n\nThe support office program was built on five years of successful waste diversion at 18 Walgreens distribution centers and related facilities in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. In fiscal 2021, around 94 percent of waste from distribution centers was diverted from landfill. The distribution centers exceeded their goal of increasing recycling volume by 5 percent between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2021.\n\nThe Orlando Distribution Center continued a partnership with NuCycle on a waste diversion project. Last fiscal year, over 113 tons of mixed packaging slated to landfill was diverted to NuCycle and turned into energy cubes.\n\nMoving materials out of landfill is one of our priorities and we have made strides at our distribution centers, which helps drive Walgreens towards zero waste.\n\nFor the third year in a row, less than 1 percent of Boots UK operational waste went to landfill, with a further reduction in fiscal 2021, to 0.63 percent. The reduction in the amount of operational waste is limited in scope to Boots UK owned operations and does not include some third-party owned office locations. At Walgreens, three distribution centers and 211 stores are no longer sending operational waste to landfill. Walgreens distribution centers continue to develop waste prevention activities aligned with membership in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) WasteWise program, a voluntary solid waste reduction program.\nAdditional Walgreens achievements and initiatives in fiscal 2021 to divert items from landfill or to reduce waste include the following:\n\nWalgreens works diligently to divert from landfill unsold or discontinued products such as food, toiletries and household items. The business works with numerous partners to donate and liquidate a wide variety of products. In fiscal 2021, Walgreens donated 10 million pounds of product and liquidated 7.7 million pounds.\n\nSaved an estimated 87 miles per day of receipt paper and reduced waste by shifting to digital customer receipts.\n\nEliminated 617,000 pounds of waste through reusable product display structures in retail pharmacies.\n\nWalgreens supports Loop\u2019s state-of-the-art circular reuse system. Loop was designed to bring together brands and retailers to enable a shift from disposal to durable containers in the retail product supply chain, whereby manufacturers own their packaging in the long term. Walgreens plans to continue its relationship with Loop in fiscal year 2022 by participating in an in-store pilot through which customers will be able to purchase branded products in durable containers, which will be returned to the stores and subsequently to the brands for reuse.\n\nMore than 28,500 red noses were used to create 19 Buddy Benches. These red benches are a place where students can sit when they need extra support or a \u201cbuddy\u201d to talk with at school. Several benches were unveiled at schools during fiscal 2021, allowing the spirit of Red Nose Day to live on and support students. The Red Nose Day charity fundraising campaign was virtual again in 2021 due to COVID-19, so no physical red noses were sold but Walgreens continued collecting and recycling red noses.\n\nLaunched a pharmacy stock bottle and bottle cap recycling program in fiscal 2021 at the Walgreens central fill pharmacy location in Arizona, with plans to expand to a second location in Texas. Stock bottles are the plastic containers medications arrive in before they are dispensed for patients.\n\nSince partnering with DHL EnviroSolutions in 2019, the integration solution has helped Boots UK to conduct audits, hold existing suppliers accountable, provide input on potential suppliers and share insights about the recycling industry. DHL EnviroSolutions has identified opportunities to improve waste processes for a variety of different types of waste and recycling, including plastic films and pallets. Currently, the partnership is also exploring opportunities to improve processes and recycling for other wastes, such as confidential waste.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, Boots UK signed up for the Food Waste Reduction Roadmap and Step Up to the Plate pledge, led by sustainability and waste nonprofit group WRAP. The collective goal of these initiatives is to reduce food waste by 50 percent by 2030, in line with SDG target 12.3.\nProgress on plastics\n\n(GRI 103-2, 306-1, 306-2, 308-1)\n\nWalgreens is a member of the Consortium to Reinvent the Retail Bag, a collaboration with major retailers and nonprofit organizations to identify, test and implement design solutions and models that sustainably serve the purpose of the current retail bag. In fiscal 2021, several pilots were launched by the founding members and Walgreens is reviewing the learnings to apply to our business.\n\nBoots continued multiple waste reduction programs through fiscal 2021, including:\n\n- At retail checkout, customers are now provided the option of unbleached bags made from Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified 100 percent recycled brown paper printed with water-based ink. By switching to paper, Boots has exceeded its goal of eliminating 2 million pounds of plastic from store operations each year.\n\n- Boots pharmacies use recycled paper bags for most medication pick up at stores, and plastic bags made of compostable material for medications dispensed from a central facility.\n\n- Boots UK has made significant progress in removing all plastic packaging from 99.8% of online deliveries. Plastic delivery bags and filler material have been replaced with 100% recycled and FSC paper based alternatives, and plastic tape for paper based tape. Contributing to this effort are automated packaging machines to reduce the volume of packaging required. The remaining orders are large baby items which are currently being packed in a starch based compostable packaging.\n\n- Ongoing partnership with POPAI, an industry body that supports manufacturers of point of sale and marketing materials, and engagement with Sustain, a web-based sustainability tool measuring the environmental impact of in-store display units produced for Boots UK stores. The first UK retailer to ask all suppliers of these units to submit a Sustain rating prior to production, Boots UK reviews Sustain ratings and works with manufacturers to reduce each unit\u2019s environmental impact.\n\nReducing plastic waste in other businesses\n\n(GRI 103-2, 306-2)\n\nPrograms designed to reduce plastic waste across our global businesses were continued and launched in fiscal 2020.\n\nFarmacias Benavides in Mexico introduced reusable cloth bags available for purchase in an effort to eliminate conventional plastic bag use in pharmacies. Through our No Bag campaign Boots Thailand continue to encourage customers to bring their own reusable bags when shopping. Any customers who need to purchase a bag are asked to donate 1 Baht to support the National Cancer Institute.\n\nProgress on water\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)\n\nDue to climate change, water availability is becoming less predictable, with implications for human health and food security. We understand the importance of this topic and that our stakeholders increasingly expect transparent reporting around water issues. As outlined on page 82, our continued rollout of WBA\u2019s owned brand global Supplier Sustainability Program will provide us with an understanding of environmental and social issues relevant to our product categories, including water. We plan to report on this and water use in our retail stores, distribution centers and support offices in our Walgreens and Boots UK businesses in accordance with GRI in future reports.\nRecycle at Boots\nTake-Back Program\n\nWith only 9 percent of the world\u2019s plastic being recycled, we feel the urgency of the waste crisis and are doing our part to advance plastic recycling and reuse. As a large beauty retailer in the UK, Boots particularly felt the need to help customers recycle beauty product packaging, containers and similar items that are often made of composite materials and end up in landfill because they cannot be recycled in household waste recycling programs.\n\nIn September 2020, Boots UK and No7 Beauty Company launched an innovative in-store program - Recycle at Boots - to make it easier for consumers to give a second life to hard-to-recycle health, beauty and wellness items. The program began with recycling drop-off points at 50 Boots stores and was so successful that it has been expanded to 700 stores across the UK. At the 50 pilot stores during the first 12 months of the program, more than 54,000 registered users deposited more than half a million items for recycling, diverting more than 15 metric tonnes of plastic waste from landfill.\n\nAt the in-store drop points, customers can deposit any brand of container or packaging from health, beauty and wellness products, with an emphasis on items such as make-up palettes, compacts, mascara tubes, lipsticks and other items that are not compatible with UK curbside recycling. Due to health and safety reasons, some products are not allowed for deposit, such as perfume bottles, medicine blister packs, hair dyes and razor blades.\n\nAs they deposit an item, customers are invited to scan the product using the Scan2Recycle technology. The device will then provide information about recycling the product. For example, the customer might learn that a particular product could be deposited for household waste recycling, and in this way they are educated about recycling. Or, the customer might receive a notification that the item was rejected for recycling, so that they know not to deposit the same item in the future.\n\nAfter scanning the item and depositing it, customers are immediately rewarded with loyalty points to spend in-store.\n\nBoots is the first retailer to use the Scan2Recycle technology, created by Metrisk Ltd. The two companies worked closely together in developing the program, with the ambition to create a transparent and scalable solution for recycling health beauty and wellness products. Prior to this, Scan2Recycle technology was untested in the context of take-back programs.\n\nThe deposited materials are recycled by waste contractor MYGroup, who invested significantly in capabilities to handle difficult-to-recycle materials and to use them to manufacture high-quality board for construction applications and other items.\n\nIn addition, Boots transports the deposited material on reverse distribution routes to reduce cost and carbon impact.\n\nBoots has also been sharing learnings from the scheme with other companies and industry groups, and hopes to see the same levels of accessibility and transparency rolled out across the industry. Boots has worked with nonprofit recycling label organization On Pack Recycling Label (OPRL) to develop criteria for take-back waste programs across industries. This criteria sets out strong standards around accessibility and transparency for take-back programs to meet in order to be credible and receive OPRL recognition that items deposited in the program are effectively recycled.\nTo provide a platform of transparency into our owned brand products, including ingredient and material level information; and to reduce the negative impacts of plastics in our owned brand products.\n\nTo continue to drive responsible sourcing practices throughout our supply chain, protecting human rights and engaging with suppliers around ethical and environmental issues;\n\nTo continue to improve traceability of ingredients and materials of our owned brand products to reduce their environmental impact and protect healthy ecosystems and reduce climate change impact;\n\nTo provide a platform of transparency into our owned brand products, including ingredient and material level information; and to reduce the negative impacts of plastics in our owned brand products.\n\nWe aim to do business fairly and with integrity and to provide transparency around ingredients and packaging:\n\nSustainable Marketplace\nSustainable Marketplace Highlights\n\nWBA joined the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil at a global, company-wide level, committing to sustainable palm oil targets for its owned brands.\n\nBoots UK and No7 Beauty Company launched an innovative in-store program - Recycle at Boots - to make it easier for consumers to give a second life to hard-to-recycle health, beauty and wellness items. The program is now available in over 700 stores.\n\nWBA owned brands launched a global Supplier Sustainability Program. More than 100 of our highest spend owned-brand product suppliers have signed up to the program and completed assessments.\n\nWBA committed to plastic reduction targets for its U.S. owned-brand products in addition to its UK-based products, and began publicly reporting on its progress toward these goals.\n\nOur UK-based owned brands reduced and eliminated plastic packaging from numerous products and increased the use of recyclable and recycled plastic packaging.\n\nWBA has met its goal of eliminating chemicals on our Restricted Substances List (RSL) from certain categories of owned brand products.\n\nWBA owned brands launched updated global sustainability minimum requirements for suppliers and a Product Sustainability Hub web portal where suppliers provide packaging and product information.\n\nNo7 Beauty Company was launched together with headline 2030 sustainability goals.\n\nNo7 launched Unstoppable Together, a multi-year campaign in the US and the UK that aims to help women defy stereotypes and enable them to reach their full potential.\n\nSoap & Glory and the Boots gift range A Little Something achieved Cruelty Free International Leaping Bunny status.\nSustainability Progress in Our Owned Brands\n\nOur approach\n\nWBA\u2019s owned brands made significant progress during fiscal 2021 on sustainability in our products and supply chains, as we continue to strive to meet customers\u2019 expectations for responsibly sourced products that contribute to a healthy planet and community well-being. Through the implementation and development of new tools and programs to engage with suppliers, we are increasingly proactive in fostering sustainability in our supply chains.\n\nWe continually develop and update our product lines and categories to adjust ingredients and packaging to meet our own evolving standards as well as changing demands. We also recognize that sustainability is increasingly important to potential new hires and our current employees, who are responsible for driving a purposeful approach in stores and across our owned brands.\n\nWBA is committed to working with vendors who share common principles of fair and honest business, demonstrate a commitment to maintaining safe working conditions and fully comply with all legal requirements and with the labor, health and safety standards of those countries in which processes take place.\n\nThe foundational standards and core principles that guide our approach to responsible sourcing and sustainable materials, ingredients and packaging can be found in the following documents, which are on our corporate website.\n\nOur Code of Conduct and Business Ethics provides foundational standards for all business aspects at WBA, including supply chain management.\n\nOur Supplier Code of Conduct outlines our core principles for supplier conduct, including compliance with laws and regulations, terms and conditions of employment, discrimination, harassment and retaliation, wages and benefits, child labor, health and safety, sustainable development and environmental protection, data privacy and anti-corruption and bribery. We expect suppliers to operate in accordance with these principles and to be open and transparent to our assessment of their compliance with the code.\n\nOur 2021 Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement sets out our commitment to eradicating these abhorrent practices, our policies and governance regarding these issues, and our actions taken during fiscal 2021.\n\nOur Human Rights Policy Statement contains our explicit commitment to respect human rights under international standards and to protect labor and workplace rights.\nOur Owned Brands at a Glance\n\nWBA and its businesses have many product brand portfolios, covering a diverse range of categories. Some of these products are sold only through our own stores and e-commerce sites. Others, such as our No7 Beauty Company beauty and skincare lines, are available at numerous retailers. We are focused on sourcing and packaging these consumer goods safely, responsibly, ethically and sustainably.\n\nNO7 BEAUTY COMPANY\nNo7 Beauty Company is a group of highly respected skincare and beauty brands, some of which have been beloved products since the 1930s. We know that by creating the best in beauty for everyone, enriching communities and sustaining our planet we are making a difference.\n\nWALGREENS OWNED BRANDS\nWalgreens owned brands are synonymous with quality and strive to live up to our century-old code: honest goods sold to honest people by honest methods. These brands and products include a wide variety of goods in numerous categories.\n\nBOOTS OWNED BRANDS\nFrom healthcare and beauty essentials to quality sunscreen, Boots owned brands enable people to live more joyful lives through better health.\nSourcing\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 308-1, 308-2, 412-2, 413-1, 414-1, 414-2)\n\nWBA implemented and progressed a number of tools and programs during fiscal 2021 to further its commitments to increase the sustainability of its owned brand products and packaging. The company also continued its rigorous ethical assessments program to combat the risk of modern slavery and other such practices in the supply chain.\n\nThrough our increasingly proactive supplier sustainability engagement, we aim to transform from an approach centered in risk assessment and management to a program in which we leverage our influence to drive sustainably through our supply chain and, in turn, through the industry. We are increasing the level of collaboration with suppliers, and through shared knowledge we also hope to create a space for sustainable innovation in our supply chains.\n\nSupplier Sustainability Program\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 308-1, 414-1)\n\nWBA's owned brand global Supplier Sustainability Program was launched in April 2021, aiming to enhance our sustainability agenda and drive improvements across the entire supply chain through an online platform for data collection, analysis, reporting and scoring. The program uses THESIS, developed by nonprofit organization The Sustainability Consortium, a holistic sustainability assessment tool set to gauge supplier practices, performance and management on energy, water, ethics and more. For example, the system captures whether a supplier has a chemicals policy in place, or an emissions reduction target. One advantage of the tool is that it is also used by other large retailers, which minimizes survey fatigue among vendors.\n\nThe product category specific assessments in THESIS allow our teams to benchmark our suppliers' sustainability performance and by proxy our WBA owned brand sustainability performance. These quantifiable, comparative supplier sustainability results will provide WBA owned brand sourcing teams with the information necessary to select the best product suppliers with sustainability agendas and targets that complement our own.\n\nMore than 100 of our highest spend owned-brand product suppliers have signed up to the program and have completed their THESIS assessments identifying their environmental and social initiatives and opportunities. This includes suppliers based in Asia, Europe and the Americas, across many of our product categories, from health and wellness, to beauty and personal care, household and food.\n\nWe plan to leverage our tier 1 owned brand supplier assessment data to identify any potential high risk areas or sustainability hot spots, engaging on sustainability issues with suppliers further down the supply chain.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we plan to encourage large national brand vendors that supply to Walgreens to complete THESIS assessments, additionally the tool will be rolled out to more owned-brand suppliers and included as part of onboarding for new product suppliers.\nEthical assessments, modern slavery, human rights\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 308-1, 308-2, 412-2, 413-1, 414-1, 414-2)\n\nUnder the minimum requirements of our ethical trading standards program, we expect suppliers to operate in accordance with the core principles outlined in our Supplier Code of Conduct and to be open and transparent to our assessment of their compliance with the code.\n\nThrough our ethical sourcing program, led by teams of ethical trading experts with the support of auditors and a small number of pre-approved third-parties, we ensure owned brand suppliers are aware of and compliant with WBA ethical standards and expectations. This is achieved through a rigorous onboarding process for all owned brand suppliers that was enhanced during fiscal 2021 and is supported by a supplier training webinar designed to explain our ethical standards and assessment requirements, share opportunities for suppliers to improve social and environmental compliance, and provide a forum for suppliers to raise questions. 100 percent of owned brand suppliers, new and existing, along with GNFR suppliers onboarded to our purchase order system via Global Risk Management Solutions (GRMS), are screened using social criteria. Supplier training webinars are held regularly in English, Mandarin and Spanish.\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, 23 supplier training webinars were held in English, with a total of 336 suppliers completing the training. Additionally, five webinars were held in Mandarin, with 142 suppliers completing the training.\n\nWe monitor owned brand supplier compliance by assessing factory social and environmental performance using a detailed grading matrix based on internationally recognized standards, including the Ethical Trading Initiative Base Code and International Labor Organization Conventions and Recommendations. Factories with identified noncompliances are required to complete corrective action plans to resolve the issue. Factories are re-assessed using a risk-based approach focused on improvement and compliance.\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic limited our ability to conduct onsite assessments in areas heavily impacted by the pandemic, we developed additional approaches to monitor supplier compliance, including self-assessment questionnaires, reviews of third-party audit reports, remote confirmation of the resolution of identified noncompliances, and remote virtual audits.\n\nWe publicly report our owned brands suppliers\u2019 compliance with our ethical standards. The table on this page provides a breakdown of our fiscal 2021 ethical compliance assessments on new and existing suppliers for Boots UK, Walgreens and No7 Beauty Company owned brands.\n\nAs the table on this page shows, no zero-tolerance issues were detected during the fiscal year. For sites with critical issues, suppliers have been required to develop and implement immediate remedial action plans to address identified non-compliances. Verification of actions taken are monitored via submission of appropriate evidence and through on-site re-assessment.\n\n| Fiscal 2021 | % of total |\n|-------------|------------|\n| Satisfactory | 364 | 38.8% |\n| Needs improvement | 424 | 45.2% |\n| Critical | 150 | 16% |\n| Zero-tolerance | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n\n938 100%\n\nSatisfactory and Needs Improvement: Meets our ethical trading standards expectations but could require differing levels of remedial corrective actions.\n\nCritical: Falls below the expectations of our ethical trading standards and requires immediate remedial action to address the critical noncompliances to enable new or ongoing business relationships.\n\nZero-Tolerance: Issues identified that are not accepted or tolerated by our business and are related to incidents of the following but not limited to: child labor, convict/indentured/forced labor, corporal punishment, slavery and human trafficking, acts of bribery. In all cases, we view these issues as zero-tolerance.\n\n1GRI 414-1 and 414-2 specified disclosures are within Deloitte and Touche LLP review scope as detailed on pages 118-119.\nOur 2021 Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement details our approach to suppliers when we identify critical noncompliance issues and zero-tolerance violations such as child labor, forced labor, human trafficking and others. WBA\u2019s policy on critical non-compliance issues is to require immediate remedial action to address the non-compliances as well as completion of a corrective action plan and re-assessment. WBA\u2019s policy on zero-tolerance violations is to terminate the business relationship with the site where the violation occurred and to suspend the supplier and its other sites pending a full investigation of the supplier and its supply chain. If the supplier is directly implicated in the zero-tolerance violation, or if further violations are found, the business relationship with the supplier will be terminated.\n\nWhen country-specific allegations of forced labor are raised, we perform due diligence to identify and mitigate the risk of forced labor in our supply chain. We also engage with industry peers to share best practices in risk prevention, detection, and mitigation. During fiscal 2021 we helped U.S. Customs and Border Protection as part of a review they carried out to better understand the complexities of retail supply chains and effective ethical sourcing practices in support of their approach to prevent items made with forced labor from being imported into the United States.\n\nWe highly value internal training on our Modern Slavery and Human Rights Statement to mitigate modern slavery risk. Our training course covered all business units in fiscal 2021 except for our joint venture in Germany. More than 2,500 team members who work in procurement, compliance or related areas were in scope for the training. Completion rate was 87 percent in the fiscal year, and greater than 90 percent in some key geographies including Chile, Thailand, China and the UK.\n\nDuring fiscal 2022 we plan to build on our Human Rights Policy Statement, published in January 2021, with a program to risk map and horizon scan across all areas where we operate, including our wider supply chain as well as our owned brands supply chain and our operations in multiple geographies. The online platform used for WBA\u2019s new Supplier Sustainability Program will also enable us to understand more about our supply chain including identifying modern slavery and human rights risks, as it will start to capture environmental and social information in second and third tier and raw material suppliers. Please read more about the Supplier Sustainability Program earlier in this section.\nIngredients and Materials\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 308-1, 412-2, 412-3, 416-1, 417-2)\n\nProduct Sustainability Hub and minimum requirements\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 308-1, 417-2)\n\nWBA created a single set of global minimum sustainability standards with established objectives and requirements for our owned brand products, packaging and components in Asia, the U.S. and the UK. These requirements, adopted in fiscal 2021, ramp up our standards across the board to demand more sustainability in ingredients and packaging for our owned brand products.\n\nTo ensure that the new minimum standards are met, our global sustainability team created a harmonized vendor portal specifications system called the Product Sustainability Hub. The requirements are available to suppliers on the hub, an interactive platform where we gather product level sustainability data and disclosures. Suppliers must acknowledge the minimum requirements and share information about the source of key raw materials and declarations on sustainability requirements. Some examples of information collected are: data and certifications on animal testing, palm oil, plastics (including single-use plastics), wood, pulp, paper, cotton, high-risk minerals and other materials.\n\nThe platform is improving transparency by enabling near real time reporting on a global level of key product sustainability attributes.\n\nFor high risk commodities, the Sustainability Hub will be used to collect information on country of origin and the level of certification received for each commodity.\n\nResponsible minerals sourcing\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 412-3, 412-2)\n\nWBA strives to limit the use of mica and talc in a number of our owned brand product categories due to the high risk of forced or child labor in the extraction of these minerals. We are working to ensure that any high-risk or conflict minerals in our products are obtained only from ethical sources and suppliers. This goal is consistent with our ethical code of conduct and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developments\u2019 (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas and its supplements.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, WBA developed and posted in the Product Sustainability Hub a responsible minerals sourcing position statement, setting out our expectation that suppliers fully disclose the use of all mineral-based raw materials and component ingredients in finished products.\n\nWBA prohibits the use of conflict minerals - tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold - where they have direct or significant influence on the manufacturing of finished products. To the extent that any conflict minerals are used as raw materials or component ingredients in finished WBA owned brand products, the company requires that suppliers ensure that these minerals are obtained from conflict-free sources or sources that are certified by a third-party audit program.\n\nChemical use and management\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 416-1)\n\nOur Chemical Policy Statement details how we assess and restrict the use of certain chemicals or ingredients in baby, personal care, beauty and household cleaning products within our owned brands, sold in our stores and online through our chemicals management program.\n\nWe also publish our Restricted Substances List (RSL) for chemicals or ingredients in the above-mentioned categories. We aim to address customer concern about the safety of some chemicals that are not restricted by law. In addition, when our own product safety analysis comes to a stricter conclusion than regulatory bodies, a substance is placed on our RSL.\n\nWe launched the RSL in calendar 2018, with a commitment to bring all in-scope products and categories into 100 percent compliance by the end of calendar 2021. We have achieved that compliance and are now preparing next steps to continue meeting customer expectations. We continue to analyze proposed new categories and substances both for the RSL and for our internal monitoring. Our aim is to drive innovation in finding safer chemical alternatives and transparency for our customers.\n\nSPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR MICA, TALC AND COBALT ARE AS FOLLOWS:\n\nMICA:\nBy Sept. 1, 2022, we expect all mica in any of our finished products to be sourced from a member of the Responsible Mica Initiative, a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative, or a supplier that provides an appropriate independent third-party audit report or certificate to demonstrate that responsible sourcing practices are aligned with the OECD Guidance.\n\nTALC:\nWe demand our suppliers exercise appropriate due diligence to ensure that any talc used is not sourced from illegal mines.\n\nCOBALT:\nCobalt is prohibited to be used in our cosmetic products. We set our expectation with suppliers for hard goods to exercise appropriate due diligence to ensure that any cobalt used is not sourced from illegal mines in The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\nPalm oil\n\nMany of our owned brand products contain palm oil and derivatives. We are committed to help incentivize a sustainable palm oil industry in order to combat deforestation, preserve habitat for wildlife and protect the rights of workers. The implementation of the Product Sustainability Hub during fiscal 2021 is allowing us to gather more comprehensive information on sustainable palm oil certifications. The information to the right shows our progress and initiatives during fiscal 2021.\n\n100% of Palm Oil in Boots UK and No7 Beauty Company was Certified in Calendar 2020\n\n- Palm oil derivatives certified using credits\n- Palm oil derivatives physically certified\n- Palm oil used as an ingredient physically certified\n- Palm oil used as an ingredient certified using credits\n\nWBA\n\nWBA joined the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), having been a member as Boots UK for many years, and will file annual communication on progress by 2023.\n\nWBA agreed to a group-wide commitment on sustainable palm oil with the RSPO.\n\nWBA is a member of the Palm Oil Transparency Coalition (POTC), working to remove deforestation and exploitation from palm oil production.\n\n11.3 overall score on the 2021 WWF Palm Oil Buyers Scorecard.\n\nNo7 Beauty Company and Boots UK owned brands\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, Boots UK and No7 Beauty Company filed annual communication on progress to the RSPO covering calendar 2020.\n\nIn calendar 2020, the proportion of palm oil and physically certified derivatives rose to 52 percent from 40 percent a year earlier, after a supplier verified a key ingredient was not made from palm oil. We are on track to achieve our previous target of 75 percent physically certified palm oil in the coming months.\n\nAll ingredients are assessed for palm oil content and certification. We engage with suppliers who use uncertified palm oil to encourage movement to physically certified palm oil.\n\nBoots UK is a member of the Retailers\u2019 Palm Oil Group, supporting the RSPO\u2019s sustainable palm oil mission.\n\nWalgreens owned brands\n\nWalgreens surveyed palm oil in owned brands, establishing a baseline to inform an increase of sustainable palm oil in our products.\n\nWalgreens committed to achieve 100 percent certified RSPO palm oil by the end of fiscal 2023, via physically certified palm oil and credits. Thereafter, we intend to increase the physically certified portion by 5 percentage points per year.\n\nWe intend to report Walgreens owned brands palm oil certification percentages in our fiscal 2022 ESG Report.\nWood, pulp and paper\n\n(GRI 103-3)\n\nIn calendar year 2020, Boots UK owned brands and No 7 Beauty Company brands achieved 96 percent use of credibly certified wood pulp and paper in owned brand products and in goods not for resale, such as receipt paper and catalogs. Considering paper and pulp in packaging, the percentage is 45 percent, based on baseline data collected for the first time. Certified wood pulp and paper come from responsibly managed forests using FSC or PEFC certification.\n\nBoots UK received the highest rank - 3 Trees - from WWF-UK\u2019s 2019 Timber Scorecard, the latest published ranking. The evaluation assesses business sourcing and performance during the procurement of timber products and the public commitments and transparency of the business.\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, Walgreens conducted a wood, paper and pulp usage supplier survey for its owned brands packaging. Based on responses from suppliers representing 73 percent of owned brand items, 19 percent of wood, paper and pulp in packaging was sustainably sourced from FSC or PEFC certified sources. The survey did not include our paper products, but we plan to collect this information in future surveys.\n\nShea\n\n(GRI 103-1, 413-1)\n\nSome of our skincare and beauty brands, such as Liz Earle, use shea butter widely in their products, as a moisturizer. WBA has been a member of the nonprofit Global Shea Alliance (GSA) since fiscal 2019, supporting its mission to promote industry sustainability, quality practices and standards around shea butter. Working with the GSA allows us to help to support women who harvest shea in Ghana and to give back to communities that work in the shea industry.\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, we continued to support the Timtooni Cooperative of 800 women who pick shea nuts in 10 rural communities outside Tamale in northern Ghana. Our support for the cooperative has included helping to build a warehouse and aiding the cooperative to identify additional buyers in order to become more resilient. In partnership with a nonprofit organization in Ghana, we aim to empower the harvesters and understand their needs.\nPackaging, Labeling and Transparency\n\nPackaging in our owned brands\n\nThe issue of packaging waste is a growing societal concern, and at WBA we are doing our part to address the negative impacts of waste from packaging. Because of limitations on recycling and circularity, plastic packaging is a particular emphasis. We have made significant progress in the past two years on surveying suppliers for our U.S. owned brands to establish baseline data to report packaging material weight and to be able to measure reduction in the future.\n\nNo company can tackle the plastics issue on its own, so WBA collaborates with a number of organizations seeking industry-wide solutions. On packaging issues, we work with groups including the Sustainable Packaging Coalition and Retail Industry Leaders Association.\n\nWBA has established public goals around plastic packaging for its owned brands, with our UK-based brands working toward 2025 targets and the U.S.-based brands working toward the same targets for 2030. The first table on this page shows these goals and where we stand on our progress as of the end of calendar 2020. The second table shows weights for all packaging materials in our owned brands. This data is reported on a calendar-year basis due to the UK Plastics Pact reporting schedule. In future reports we plan to shift to a fiscal-year reporting schedule aligned with our other ESG performance data.\n\n| Requirement set for suppliers through WBA\u2019s Product Sustainability Hub | Long-term target | UK owned brands progress in calendar 2020\u00b9 | Walgreens owned brand progress in calendar 2020\u00b2 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Optimize the amount of plastic used and minimize the number of different plastics in the design of packaging components. | UK owned brands: reduce plastic packaging by 30% by 2025 compared with 2018. | Total weight of all plastic packaging: 5,454 metric tonnes, including primary, secondary and tertiary packaging. | Total weight of all plastic packaging: 10,352 metric tonnes. This is our baseline year and the figure is based on response from suppliers. |\n| | U.S. owned brands: reduce plastic packaging by 30% by 2030 compared with 2020. | | |\n| Maximize the potential for plastic to be reused or recycled by consumers. | UK owned brands: 100% of plastic packaging is reusable or recyclable by consumers by 2025. | 60% | We plan to report for fiscal 2022. |\n| | U.S. 100% of plastic packaging is reusable or recyclable by consumers by 2030. | | |\n| Use post-consumer recyclate (PCR) wherever feasible, aiming for at least 30% minimum (by weight). | UK owned brands: 30% average recycled content is achieved across all plastic packaging by 2025. | 7% | We plan to report for fiscal 2022. |\n| | U.S. owned brands: 30% average recycled content is achieved across all plastic packaging by 2030. | | |\n| Seek to eliminate materials that hinder recyclability and unnecessary single use components and materials. | All problematic or unnecessary single-use packaging is eliminated in the UK by 2025 and in the U.S. by 2030. | Worked with UK Plastics Pact to identify and eliminate problematic materials including PETG, polystyrene and PVC. | We plan to report for fiscal 2022. |\n\nPackaging material in owned brand products (includes primary, secondary and tertiary packaging) for calendar 2020\u00b3\n\n| Material | Metric tonnes\u2074 |\n|---|---|\n| Glass | 1,491 |\n| Metal | 1,229 |\n| Wood/paper fiber (not including pallets) | 30,576 |\n| Plastic\u2075 | 15,806 |\n\n\u00b9Includes owned brands Walgreens, Boots and No7 Beauty Company.\n\u00b2Our UK packaging and plastics reporting data is relatively complete as it has been collected for a number of years.\n\u00b3Walgreens data is based on supplier survey responses covering 72 percent of owned brand items, 28 percent is estimated.\n\u2074GRI 306-3 specified disclosures for plastic only are within Deloitte & Touche LLP review scope as detailed on pages 118-119.\n\u2075Includes owned brands Walgreens, Boots and No7 Beauty Company.\nAnother significant packaging sustainability project in fiscal 2021 was the relaunch of No7 cosmetics packaging (e.g. lipsticks, compacts, foundation, mascara and more with less plastic by weight, more post-consumer recycled content, and higher recyclability. During fiscal 2020, we started working with key packaging suppliers to make the following innovative changes, which will be in market fiscal 2022:\n\n- Steel weights were removed from products, eliminating 23 metric tonnes of steel per year. Savings were re-invested in PCR plastic.\n- Compacts and lipstick cases that had zero PCR plastic, now contain 25 to 30 percent PCR.\n- Recyclability claims for No7 product packaging are carefully vetted against multiple criteria, including ability to collect, sort, clean, re-process and having an end market for the recycled material.\n\nPlastic was almost entirely removed from secondary packaging for Boots UK 2020 owned brand holiday gifts. Secondary packaging is the decorative gift box for products such as perfume, make-up or toiletry sets. For these gift items, plastic used in secondary packaging for the 2020 holiday season was 1.36 metric tonnes, down from more than 400 metric tonnes the previous season, and the percent of plastic in packaging for all products was well under a tenth of a percent, compared with 15 percent previously. In addition, all material used in secondary packaging for the 2020 holiday season was recyclable.\n\nNo7 Beauty Company invested in research and development of new packaging for some of its most iconic products. For example, No7 products in 50 milliliter jars are moving into a bespoke glass jar. This change will bring about an 82 percent reduction in plastic and eliminate hundreds of tons a year of PETG, a problematic plastic.\n\nThe new No7 jar sustainability attributes are as follows:\n\n| Sustainability goal or attribute | Former No7 Jar | New No7 Jar |\n|----------------------------------|---------------|-------------|\n| Use 100% recyclable plastic in packaging by 2025 | Not recyclable | 100% recyclable |\n| Eliminate problematic plastics | PETG plastic cap, which is considered a problematic plastic | No problematic plastic |\n| 30% average recycled content across all plastic packaging | No post consumer recycled plastic | 30% recycled plastic in the lid of the jar |\n| Reduce carbon emissions | The carbon footprint of existing packaging (jar & cap) was 0.90 kg CO2e per 50ml jar* | The carbon footprint of the new packaging (jar and cap) is 0.32 kg CO2e per 50ml jar, at least 60% lower compared to the previous packaging |\n| Reduce energy use and waste | Metallized caps were manufactured through a process involving high energy use and high waste | No metallized caps |\n\n*Results based on a life cycle assessment in 2021 using SPICE (Methodology and) eco-design Tool. The Sustainable Packaging Initiative for Cosmetics (SPICE) is a pre-competitive initiative that develops collective solutions toward sustainable packaging for cosmetics.\nWBA Collaboration\n\nWBA collaborates with a number of organizations and with government entities, seeking industry-wide solutions on packaging and plastics issues, including the following:\n\n- **EPR Regulations**\n  WBA companies are closely following the development of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) rules for packaging in different geographies around the world. In the UK, we are working with government departments on the design of EPR systems, and we also engage on the issue through our membership in the Industry Council for Packaging and the Environment (INCPEN). We support well designed and efficient EPR systems for packaging waste.\n\n- **Sustainable Packaging Coalition**\n  WBA is a member of this independent, nonprofit-led organization. We participate in learning events with the coalition and are implementing its How2Recycle label on an increasing number of our products.\n\n- **SPICE**\n  No7 Beauty Company has joined SPICE - a collaborative initiative - and is using its methodology to assess the environmental impact of cosmetics packaging across the product\u2019s life cycle.\n\nLabeling\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 306-2, 417-1)\n\nWBA is committed to increasing product transparency for consumers and continues to evaluate methods for standardized, consumer-friendly and enhanced labeling information.\n\nWBA vendor agreements stipulate that vendors must meet regulatory requirements for labeling of ingredients on our owned brand products. In addition, to meet customer expectations, we have enhanced clarity of information on the labels of many of these products.\n\nUnder the updated minimum standard requirements put in place during fiscal 2021, new and refreshed WBA owned brand items must carry a How2Recycle label, for U.S. products, or an On-Pack Recycling Label (OPRL) for UK products. There are exceptions for practical considerations such as space on packaging. These labels are designed to provide customers with clear advice on how to recycle. In the UK, WBA has representation on the OPRL technical advisory committee, where it is helping to work on industry-wide solutions involving recycling.\nBrands with Purpose: No7 Beauty Company\n\nWBA\u2019s No7 Beauty Company was launched in April 2021, as a consumer-led beauty business creating trusted, affordable beauty brands for every skin type, ethnicity, age and texture. No7 Beauty Company\u2019s collection of iconic, global beauty brands includes No7, Liz Earle, Botanics, Soap & Glory, Sleek MakeUP and YourGoodSkin.\n\nOur No7 beauty brand are the allies of unstoppable women everywhere, committed to giving them the support, confidence and momentum to live life on their terms. In support of their brand purpose, No7 launched Unstoppable Together, a brand and cultural platform and multi-year campaign focused on helping support women defy stereotypes and enabling them to reach their full potential.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, four times more women left the workforce than men, resulting in an unprecedented She-cession. With a \u2018SHEcovery\u2019 as the campaigns initial priority, No7 has partnered with The Female Quotient in the US and The Female Lead in the UK \u2013 leading organisations focussed on advancing gender equality \u2013 in support of this goal.\n\nHighlights of the award-winning Unstoppable Together campaign in fiscal 2021 included a free virtual Job Summit and offering $100,000 worth of free coaching sessions covering topics such as interview skills, networking in the new normal and how to pivot to a new career. No7 have also partnered with AllBright \u2013 the leading global careers network for women \u2013 to create the No7 X AllBright SheCovery Course Collection, giving women exclusive access to tools and resources to help support in their working lives.\n\nSustainability Commitment\n\nPlacing its leading insights into customer shopping behaviors at the heart of its strategy, No7 Beauty Company will continue to develop products through world-class innovation and sustainable sourcing practices. Guided by a bold roadmap, it pledges to achieve the following three overarching sustainability goals by 2030:\n\n- At least 50% of our global sales will come from healthier, more sustainable products and services\n- 1/2 of the overall impact of new products we place on the market compared to 2019\n- X2 the value we create for society, compared to 2019\n\nWe look forward to reporting on details and progress on these ambitions in future ESG Reports.\nSome highlights of No7 Beauty Company sustainability initiatives and achievements during fiscal 2021 include the following:\n\n**No7**\n\nNo7 launched Unstoppable Together, a U.S. and UK multi-year campaign that aims to help women defy stereotypes and enable them to reach their full potential.\n\n**WBA**\n\nWBA was among the founding members of the Sustainable Beauty Coalition, an initiative launched by the British Beauty Council. The global head of sustainability for No7 Beauty Company sits on the coalition\u2019s steering committee, supporting its mission to accelerate the sustainability efforts of the UK beauty sector.\n\n**Soap & Glory**\n\nSoap & Glory became our latest brand to achieve Cruelty Free International Leaping Bunny certification, following Botanics, Liz Earle and the Boots gift range \u2018A Little Something\u2019. The Leaping Bunny label is the globally recognizable gold standard for cruelty free cosmetics.\n\n**Liz Earle**\n\nLiz Earle became a certified CarbonNeutral company, having evaluated and reduced the carbon footprint of its business operations and offsetting its remaining carbon emissions. In addition, its holiday 2021 gifts are all certified as CarbonNeutral products.\n\n**Botanics**\n\nBotanics launched its first sustainability report, which is available here.\n\n**No7 Beauty Company brands**\n\nNo7 Beauty Company brands made significant steps to reduce plastic packaging. Read more about this work in the Packaging, Labeling and Transparency section of this report.\n\n**Liz Earle**\n\nLiz Earle became a new member of the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT), committing to sourcing ingredients from biodiversity in a way that respects people and nature.\n\n---\n\n1 The Cruelty Free International Leaping Bunny is the best assurance that a company has made a genuine commitment to help end animal testing. Brands must meet rigorous criteria which apply globally and extend over and above laws governing animal testing and include ongoing independent audits.\nWBA is committed to transparency in all its CSR activities and in reporting performance against our goals. Our CSR strategy is central to our business purpose and is overseen by the WBA CSR Committee and reports on a bi-annual basis to the WBA Nominations and Governance Committee. The Nomination & Governance Committee oversees the CSR agenda on behalf of the WBA Board and receives regular updates on the full range of activities undertaken by the Company including but not limited to:\n\n- Conducting a WBA-wide materiality assessment at least every three years\n- Monitoring and communicating about CSR-related long-term strategic partnerships and their impact\n- Monitoring WBA\u2019s engagement with external stakeholders and other interested parties with regard to CSR-related matters\n- Ensuring the integration of CSR processes with the WBA\u2019s broader business, social and environmental risk management program and reputation management priorities\n- Ensuring that WBA is taking the appropriate measures to undertake and implement CSR projects successfully\n- Ongoing review of CSR-related policies and publication of policy statements\n- Review and benchmark best practice in key CSR areas by appropriate external reports\n- Continuing external assurance by Deloitte & Touche LLP of reported data and disclosures\n- Participate regularly in various external CSR disclosure surveys\n\n05\n\nGovernance\nCorporate Governance and Risk Management\n\nOverview\nAt WBA, we actively care for our employees and customers, and seek to continuously improve our robust approach to safety and privacy.\n\nIn this section of the report, we cover our corporate and CSR governance, risk management, code of conduct and ethics, workplace safety, patient safety and product safety, information security and privacy.\n\nOur approach\nWBA believes that strong corporate governance is an essential element to achieving our overall objectives and acting as a responsible organization.\n\nThe WBA board of directors is committed to sound corporate governance and our governance structure helps enable the board to fulfill its fiduciary duties to our stockholders and helps ensure the long-term success of the company. The board exercises oversight of the company\u2019s strategic, operational and financial matters, including the elements and dimensions of major risks facing the company.\n\nHaving appropriate oversight and governance of our CSR program is critical to its success. Our CSR Committee plays a leading role in providing this oversight and governance. The CSR Committee is chaired by our Chief Operating Officer International Ornella Barra and includes senior executives from our key businesses as well as the legal, human resources, accounting, marketing, public affairs and communications functions. The CSR Committee meets regularly and, among other obligations, is charged with reviewing our CSR program and with overseeing our CSR policy statements. The Committee also selects and approves our CSR commitments and targets (both internal and external) and oversees our progress toward achieving those commitments and targets. In addition, the Committee also formally approves our annual ESG report.\n\nAt the board level, the Nominating and Governance Committee reviews, at least twice a year, our policies and activities regarding sustainability, CSR and ESG reporting and assesses our management of risks in those areas. The members of the Nominating and Governance Committee are all independent directors.\n\nOur Corporate Social Responsibility Policy Statements are available on our website. These statements shape our approach to our sustainability and CSR activities and help ensure that our segments and businesses are working within comparable parameters.\n\nThe company\u2019s Enterprise Risk Management program maintains a summary of key risks and related mitigation. We continually enhance our risk mitigation activities, and when risks are identified above a certain threshold, the company develops action plans to mitigate them with clear allocation of responsibilities and timescales for completion, and works to ensure that progress toward implementing these plans is monitored and reported. More information on the risk management process and the material risks is included in WBA\u2019s most-recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nAs reported in our Form 10-K, among the many factors that could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results, are the long-term effects of global climate change.\n\nThese effects present both physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels) and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes), which are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. These changes could over time affect, for example, the availability and cost of products, commodities and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require. In addition, many of our operations and facilities around the world are in locations that may be impacted by the physical risks of climate change, and we face the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to stores, distribution or fulfillment centers, loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events. We also use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline and electricity in our operations, all of which could face increased regulation as a result of climate change or other environmental concerns. Regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and energy inputs may also increase in coming years, which may increase our associated costs.\nCode of Conduct and Ethics\n\n(GRI 102-17, 103-1, 103-2)\n\nThe WBA Code of Conduct and Ethics is our compass. It guides us, as a company, as a team and as individuals, to make ethical decisions that stay true to our values while abiding by the laws and regulations in the places where we do business.\n\nWe updated our Code during fiscal 2021, to support us in doing what\u2019s right in the fast paced, dynamic environments we operate in today. The Code also supports strong governance of our behaviors and our approach to CSR.\n\nThe Code extends to our board of directors, company officers, team members, team members of our subsidiaries, officers and employees of any business in which WBA or a subsidiary has a controlling interest, and parties acting on behalf of WBA or its subsidiaries, including consultants, agents, suppliers, intermediaries or representatives.\n\nMore information on our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the Code of Conduct, including mechanisms for reporting suspected violations of the Code and concerns about ethics, can be found on our corporate website.\n\nSafety\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 403-1, 403-2, 403-3, 403-4, 403-5, 403-6, 403-7, 416-1, 417-1)\n\nWorkplace safety\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 403-1, 403-2, 403-3, 403-7)\n\nWBA is committed to creating and upholding safe environments for employees, customers, contractors, suppliers and patients across our business operations including retail, wholesale and corporate offices. We continuously work to improve our robust management of health and safety, sometimes exceeding local legislative requirements, guided by the WBA Health, Safety and Environmental Committee and WBA Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) Policy.\n\nWe encourage open dialogue and constructive feedback from our stakeholders to help ensure we achieve best practices. We also require that all segments, businesses and the corporate function have formal governance processes in place for health and safety matters in the business operations for which they are responsible.\n\nTo create a safe and productive workplace, employees across our businesses are offered avenues to report incidents including calling a toll-free, confidential hotline, submitting an online report, emailing the compliance officer and contacting human resources.\nCOVID-19 safety response\n\nCOVID-19 did not change our philosophy on safety, which continues to be a top priority. Due to the unprecedented nature of COVID-19, we created new governance teams, policies and procedures, and changes to day-to-day responsibilities of our Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) team.\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, Walgreens\u2019 task force and pandemic response team launched numerous safety-related initiatives related to COVID-19 vaccinations while continuing to implement trainings, conduct disease monitoring and surveillance, and establish and communicate COVID-19 employee compensation tools and support. The pandemic response team continued to respond to related cases through clinical intake, tracking and contact tracing, field response, record keeping and legal notifications.\n\nWalgreens acted in compliance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines, and local recommendations and mandates, updating company policies and practices as guidelines evolved.\n\nPersonal protective equipment (PPE) requirements, cleaning policies and safety procedures were created and enforced across stores and our other locations for the safety of employees and customers. PPE delivered to pharmacy locations during fiscal 2021 included more than 126 million wipes, more than 11 million ounces of cleaners, more than 2 million masks, more than 53 million ounces of hand sanitizer and more than 12 million vinyl gloves.\n\nFor more than 6,300 COVID-19 testing sites across the U.S. and Puerto Rico, Walgreens established standards including procedures, training, operational flows, applicable PPE and hazardous exposure management and disposal requirements. We fostered a culture of safety through FAQ\u2019s and through addressing concerns promptly. We established medical and regulatory compliance reviews for all diagnostic testing models and provided additional resources to support all safety requirements.\n\nBoots UK teams across all levels continued to focus on COVID-19 responses related to safety. They held regular calls to address changing needs of different parts of the business including stores, warehouses and corporate offices, as the pandemic evolved. Teams were managed through the Boots UK crisis management governance structure with oversight by executives.\n\nBoots UK maintains working relationships with UK councils and enforcement bodies, asking their safety primary authority council for assured advice on an ad-hoc basis. Assessments conducted by primary authorities resulted in assured advice for COVID-19 risk assessment and controls.\n\nSafety campaigns\n\nThrough trainings and focus on safety culture, Walgreens has achieved employee and customer accident incident reductions in retail stores over a six-year period ended Aug. 31, 2021.\n\nWalgreens has continued its ongoing, chain-wide initiative to reduce stockroom risk of incidents and as of the end of fiscal 2021 more than 26 percent of Walgreens locations had converted to a Safety Focused Stockroom environment. Incidents that occur in stockrooms are often more severe due to the use of ladders and an element of this safety program is to have all items stored on shelves no more than six feet high.\n\nThrough its Customer Care Advocate Program, Walgreens proactively offers support to customers who have reported an in-store incident. In fiscal 2021, program advocates connected with more than 5,700 customers and hosted more than 17,000 calls.\n\nWalgreens also has in-store sharps kiosks available to customers at certain locations.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, Boots UK saw a 12 percent reduction in employee reportable injury accidents and a 4 percent reduction in employee RIDDOR (Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations) reportable injury accidents.\n\nBoots UK Burton warehouse continued to modernize the customer order picking process in fiscal 2021. The warehouse continued to add cobots - robots that work alongside people to collect items throughout the facility - driving further risk reduction in picking injuries. Boots also continued to extend its Toolbox Talks video platform to reinforce safe behaviors in warehouses.\n\nIn Boots stores, routine safety inspections were moved onto a digital platform, enabling a real-time view of compliance.\nCustomer and patient safety: pharmacy dispensing\n\nDispensing and distribution of pharmaceuticals is the most significant part of our business, with more than 67 percent of our sales in fiscal 2021 coming from the sale and distribution of prescription medications and pharmacy-related services. Millions of people every day count on us to safely deliver and dispense medications. WBA is committed to the safe dispensing of medicines in our pharmacies and patient safety lies at the heart of our management of pharmacy operations. We strive to be the industry leader by continuously seeking ways to minimize risks to patients in our dispensing and pharmacy services and advice.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we enhanced and updated our clinical decision support software and provided pharmacists with a new training around how to appropriately manage clinical considerations in patient drug therapy. All WBA pharmacy dispensing businesses annually review and evaluate pharmacy operations for compliance with our Pharmacy Operations Governance Policy. Each operating business completes a letter of representation highlighting whether there are areas of noncompliance in business procedures, and includes an action plan stating when those areas will be rectified. During fiscal 2021, the WBA Patient Safety Forum continued to convene representatives from all pharmacy dispensing businesses to share best practice operations, facilitate a culture of openness and shared learning and develop innovative patient safety solutions. The forum includes Walgreens\u2019 vice president of pharmacy quality, compliance and patient safety, WBA\u2019s vice president and director of international public affairs, senior vice president and chief compliance and ethics officer, and vice president of governance, risk and compliance; and Boots UK\u2019s chief pharmacist, among others.\n\nAnnual pharmacy operations reviews include the following, as well as other items:\n\n- Monitoring procedures for the professional qualifications of pharmacists and employees in pharmacy-related positions\n- Processes to facilitate compliance with professional development requirements for pharmacy staff\n- Processes to help ensure concerns about pharmacy professionals\u2019 fitness to practice are referred to the appropriate regulatory body\n- Compliance with safe storage, preparation, dispensing, compounding, sale and supply of medicinal products\n- Mechanisms for compliance with standard operating procedures covering dispensing, pharmacist control checks, patient counseling, record keeping, management of controlled drugs and narcotics, medicines date checking, quality assurance, error management and other issues\n- Recording, management and reporting of dispensing errors, including a formal review process and action planning to minimize the risk of such errors occurring\n\n1 GRI 416-1 and SASB HC-DR-260b.2 required disclosures are within the Deloitte & Touche LLP review scope as detailed on pages 118-119.\nOur state-of-the-art pharmacy systems are designed around the safe dispensing of medications. Our standardized dispensing processes detail each step in the fulfillment process, from receipt of prescription through consultation and dispensing of the medication. There are multiple digital safety checks including bar code scanning, safety enhancing automation processes and digital safety alerts utilizing cutting edge technology. To help ensure patient safety, our prescription labels are designed to meet both regulatory requirements and our internal standards. Descriptions of medications are affixed to each prescription dispensed and each prescription is dispensed with a patient leaflet that informs patients of the name and use of the medication, potential adverse reactions, information about drug interactions, safe medication disposal and other important health information. This information is available in 21 different languages and additional services are available for visually impaired patients.\n\nAll WBA businesses must have documented processes in place to facilitate the collection of key performance metrics on health and safety, including pharmacy incidents. Safety performance is supported by robust systems, procedures and monitoring to reduce and prevent incidents, such as through Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) programs.\n\nOur CQI programs support and uphold our longstanding Patient Safety Culture by empowering and encouraging all team members to report pharmacy incidents, near misses and overall safety opportunities to the Patient Safety Research Foundation, a patient safety organization listed with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Multiple safety data sources are reported and analyzed and opportunities for process, systems, physical environment and educational materials are constantly evaluated. Technology and process solutions as well as ongoing team member activities and training are developed based on the results of the evaluation.\n\nWalgreens continues to maintain National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) accreditation for Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) and Community Pharmacy. The Community Pharmacy Accreditation recognizes the pharmacy for an advanced level of patient care services, quality and safety. In addition, Walgreens has current chain-wide Community Based Specialty (CBS) URAC accreditation as well as ACHC accreditations for select CBS sites. URAC and ACHC are independent third-party organizations that provide healthcare accreditations based on rigorous standards and reviews.\n\nProduct Safety\nGRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 416-1, 417-1\n\nAt WBA, product safety is a priority. We ensure our owned branded products - which include health, beauty, home and cleaning products, food, paper goods and other categories - are rigorously analyzed for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations along with our own high safety and quality standards. We understand our customers expect to feel confident in the transparency and safety of the products they purchase.\n\nOur product safety and quality programs are incorporated at every stage of our owned brand products lifecycle, from product development through customer purchase and use. We require vendors and factories for our owned brand products to use a third-party product testing lab that we select to validate safety and quality before our products reach shelves.\n\nOur vendors are expected to implement best practices, including clearly defined and well-documented good manufacturing and quality processes, training and record keeping. Through our rigorous supplier and vendor qualification process and factory assessment process, we can evaluate our vendors\u2019 and factories\u2019 ability to deliver consistent, safe, and quality products. An industry standard Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) audit is a minimum requirement for production facilities, in all regulated and non-regulated product categories.\n\nWe have established a multi-stage product-testing program to ensure products are tested during the production through on-shelf availability. Our program builds in required and periodic testing from independent, third-party laboratories validating that safety compliance and applicable regulatory standards have been satisfied, including but not limited to: analytical tests (chemical/composition), performance tests (durability/functionality), packaging validation (labeling) and flammability standards.\n\nOur cross-functional leadership team is accountable for ensuring customer feedback is actively reviewed and analyzed. If we learn about an issue with one of our products, our quality incident process is activated and we systematically investigate and, when necessary, quickly withdraw the product from our stores and e-commerce platforms. If a product has been determined to need a withdrawal from the market, we ensure it isn\u2019t sold by issuing a lock on the product at our distribution centers, point of sale at the store and online. We take our customers\u2019 safety seriously and commit to provide information access for any recalled Owned Brand product. These details are available any time on our websites.\nInformation Security\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)\n(SASB HC-DR-230a.1)\n\nWe place the utmost importance on ensuring the integrity of data and the protection of our customers, patients, employees and company information. The company\u2019s security processes and controls for information technology (IT) systems and resources, our business, and employees, contractors and third parties help ensure that confidentiality, integrity and availability of our IT are maintained.\n\nThe Global Chief Information Security Officer oversees the security of the company\u2019s computer systems, data, networks and other assets, with oversight from the board of directors\u2019 Audit Committee. The company conducts multiple information security audits and vulnerability assessments on different sections of our IT systems, data and networks, on at least an annual basis. WBA also has an information security incident response team and maintains a data security event plan to effectively manage and respond to information security incidents.\n\nOur global information security policies, which are based on industry frameworks such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the International Organization for Standardization, set the compliance guidelines for our people, processes and systems. At the request of our business partners, WBA also engages with HITRUST, a third-party organization, to conduct an assessment of the security and privacy controls around Walgreens patient data. HITRUST Certification is valid for two years and was last renewed in 2021. WBA works with an independent assessor to conduct interim assessments to ensure continued adherence to HITRUST requirements. Additionally, Walgreens is subject to an annual Payment Card Industry (PCI) assessment that is performed by an external assessor and includes a review of our policies and procedures to protect Walgreens customer credit card data.\n\nBuilding and nurturing a culture of security is key to protecting information. New employees receive training on a variety of issues, including security and privacy. This training is embedded in our security fundamentals training, which is refreshed on an annual basis. This training applies to pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, retail team members and team members at our support offices.\n\nWe also build awareness about phishing through regular campaigns to our employees with company emails. Training and information is available to employees on our corporate intranet sites. Additionally we use posters to engage employees on the importance of being alert to cybersecurity risks.\nPatient and Customer Privacy\n\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)\n(SASB HC-DR-230a.1)\n\nAs a global healthcare leader and retailer, personal information is provided to WBA through purchases, filling prescriptions, enrolling in promotional and loyalty programs, registering on our websites, or otherwise communicating with us. We are committed to protecting customer privacy and data with leading data protection standards.\n\nThe Global Chief Privacy Officer oversees the privacy of WBA\u2019s patient, consumer, and employee data, with oversight from the board of directors\u2019 Audit Committee. We conduct privacy impact assessments and data protection impact assessments on an annual basis, and results are routinely shared with the Audit Committee.\n\nWe are transparent with our customers about how we use their data. Our posted statements on our websites include information about data usage and safeguards. We post our policies around individual rights requests from customers who are California residents, regarding the use and deletion of their personal information. We comply with EU and UK law on data protection and privacy. Our policy is to notify all data subjects of any impermissible disclosure, in accordance with the applicable laws.\n\nIn the U.S., where approximately 80 percent of the WBA personal health data resides, our Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy rule compliance program incorporates administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. Under our HIPAA policy we receive written authorization from the data subject where required, and all collection and processing is limited to the stated purpose. We also have a program to receive, investigate and respond to privacy complaints.\n\nAnnual privacy training is mandatory for applicable team members, including pharmacy, retail and support office. Applicable U.S. contractors are legally obligated to receive privacy training. In Europe, supplemental privacy training is sent regularly to privacy champions throughout our businesses.\n\nWe also have policies and procedures in place that govern data transfers to third parties, including appropriate methods and controls, such as standard contractual clauses.\n\n1 Fiscal 2021 data is included within the scope of Deloitte & Touche LLP review as detailed in the assurance report on pages 118-119.\nAbout This Report\n\n(GRI 102-46, 102-48, 102-49, 102-50, 102-51, 102-52, 102-53, 102-56)\n\nWBA has reported on a wide range of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) topics since 2015. Our reporting is focused on our highest priority and most material ESG topics \u2014 those that we believe are the most relevant to our business and important to our stakeholders.\n\nOur fiscal 2021 ESG Report reflects our ongoing healthcare-centered ESG strategy, as explained in Our Approach to Corporate Responsibility section found on page 7 and details our performance on ESG topics. This report outlines our agile and holistic response to emerging issues affecting society, our business and the healthcare and retail industries, including COVID-19 and the racial equity movement.\n\nThis report covers data and progress from fiscal 2021, the 12 months ended Aug. 31, 2021, and includes content from our ongoing global operations. The prior report from fiscal 2020 was published on Jan. 27, 2021 and can be found on the CR section of our corporate website. We plan to continue to report on an annual basis in the future.\n\nAs published in the ESG Materiality section, found on pages 15-17 of this report, in fiscal 2021 we completed a new materiality assessment: a process that involves consulting with a wide variety of external and internal stakeholders to identify and prioritize the environmental, social and governance topics most material to our business across our value chain. We leverage these material issues to prioritize our disclosures and effectively communicate to our stakeholders. We will continue to adjust our strategy to meet stakeholder expectations and to address evolving environmental, social and governance market challenges.\n\nOur ESG Report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core option. The Report also includes the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards, and our first qualitative Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) disclosure, building on our responses to the CDP Climate questionnaire in previous years. The Report also serves as our annual United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress.\n\nDeloitte & Touche LLP reviewed specified indicators within this report in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Their assurance report can be found on pages 118-119.\n\nData management process\n\n(GRI 102-56)\n\nWe have a company-wide approach to recording, measuring and reporting ESG performance, including a set of reporting criteria and a set of ESG measures and performance indicators. Across all of our businesses we capture data on corporate giving, carbon emissions, energy use, waste by disposal, water use, employee retention and diversity, and use the data to inform and assist in the development of individual ESG programs. In addition, in the United States segment we capture data on employee race and ethnicity, and for our owned brands we collect data on palm oil and packaging.\n\nThe data presented within this report reflect the ongoing operations of the company during fiscal 2021 and were produced in accordance with the Walgreens Boots Alliance ESG Performance Data Basis of Preparation, which can be found on pages 120-125 of this report. Our Statement of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions for fiscal 2021 and its external assurance from Deloitte & Touche LLP can also be found in the same area of our website Corporate Responsibility area of the company\u2019s corporate website.\n\nESG performance data are collected comprehensively on an annual basis. All submissions by individual businesses are prepared by local finance teams and local CSR champions and are reviewed by senior finance leaders.\n\nIn fiscal 2016, WBA collected environmental and social data across its operations for the first time, forming the baseline for our fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 CSR Reports. In our fiscal 2019 report, we re-set baselines for our environmental performance metrics because we included for the first time energy and waste data from 1,932 Rite Aid stores acquired the previous year. This was done in order to provide meaningful comparatives as required by the GHG Protocol.\n\nOn June 1, 2021, the company completed the sale of the majority of the company's Alliance Healthcare business as well as a portion of the company's retail pharmacy international businesses in Europe (\u201cdiscontinued operation\u201d) to AmerisourceBergen Corporation. Unless otherwise specified, disclosures in this report reflect continuing operations only. Certain prior period data, primarily related to discontinued operations, have been restated to conform to the current period presentation.\n\nEvery effort is made to ensure that we report accurate data, and our processes are designed to support this. In cases where we become aware of updates to data from previous years, we consider providing updated data in subsequent reports if the changes result in a discrepancy that is material. In these cases, we provide details in footnotes to our data tables.\nGRI Content Index\n\n(GRI 102-54, 102-55)\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance has carried out an ongoing exercise to align our ESG reporting to the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. This GRI Content Index reflects the material CSR topics that emerged in our most recent complete ESG materiality assessment, which was concluded during fiscal 2021.\n\n| GRI Disclosure | References and responses |\n|----------------|--------------------------|\n| GRI 101: FOUNDATION 2016 | Our Approach to CR; pages 7-14 |\n| GENERAL DISCLOSURES | |\n| GRI 102: General Disclosures 2016 | |\n| ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE | |\n| 102-1 Name of the organization | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. |\n| 102-2 Activities, brands, products, and services | 2021 Annual Report; pages 1-12 |\n| 102-3 Location of headquarters | At a Glance: WBA; page 5 |\n| 102-4 Location of operations | At a Glance: WBA; page 5 |\n| 102-5 Ownership and legal form | 2021 Annual Report; pages 1-4 |\n| 102-6 Markets served | 2021 Annual Report; pages 5-12 |\n| 102-7 Scale of the organization | 2021 Annual Report; pages 1, 5-12 |\n| 102-8 Information on employees and other workers | Employee Health and Well-being; pages 61-65 |\n| | Diversity, Equity and Inclusion; pages 52-59 |\n| | 2021 Annual Report; pages 10-12 |\n| GRI Disclosure | References and responses |\n|----------------|--------------------------|\n| **ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE (cont.)** | Walgreens Website  \nBoots UK Website |\n| 102-9 Supply chain | At a Glance: WBA; page 5  \nSustainability Progress in Our Owned Brands; pages 80-81  \n2021 Annual Report; pages 1-33 |\n| 102-10 Significant changes to the organization and its supply chain | 2021 Annual Report; pages 1-33 |\n| 102-11 Precautionary principle or approach | Direct Response: Walgreens Boots Alliance does not have a policy regarding the precautionary principle or approach.

For our U.S. Walgreens business operating in all 50 states, we increased the starting hourly wage for all team members to $15.00 an hour, taking in effect in phases beginning in October 2021 and expected to be fully implemented by Nov. 1, 2022. The company consistently reviews wages guidelines to make updates where needed. In April of 2021, Boots UK applied the national minimum wage increase to its payroll, offering a base of pay that remains more than 5 percent above the national requirement. Approximately two-thirds of the Boots UK workforce saw a pay increase of 2 percent or more from the adjustment. |\n### MARKET PRESENCE (cont.)\n\n| GRI Disclosure | References and responses |\n|----------------|--------------------------|\n| **INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACTS** | |\n| **GRI 103: Management Approach 2016** | |\n| 103-1 Explanation of the material topic and its Boundary | At a Glance: WBA; page 5  \nOur Approach to CR; pages 7-44  \nESG Materiality; pages 15-17  \nFocus Story: Health Equity; pages 25-29  \nHealthcare Access, Awareness and Education; pages 32-40 |\n| 103-2 The management approach and its components | Our Approach to CR; pages 7-44  \nESG Materiality; pages 15-17  \nFocus Story: Health Equity; pages 25-29  \nHealthcare Access, Awareness and Education; pages 32-40  \nOpioid Abuse Prevention; page 41  \nPartnerships for Good; pages 42-46 |\n| 103-3 Evaluation of the management approach | Our Approach to CR; pages 7-44  \nESG Materiality; pages 15-17  \nFocus Story: Health Equity; pages 25-29  \nHealthcare Access, Awareness and Education; pages 32-40  \nPartnerships for Good; pages 42-46 |\n\n### GRI 203: Indirect Economic Impacts 2016\n\n| 203-1 Infrastructure investments and services supported | Focus Story: Health Equity; pages 25-29  \nHealthcare Access, Awareness and Education; pages 32-40  \nOpioid Abuse Prevention; page 41  \nPartnerships for Good; pages 42-46  \nGiving Back: Corporate Donations and Supporting Causes; pages 47-49 |\n| 203-2 Significant indirect economic impacts | Focus Story: Health Equity; pages 25-29  \nHealthcare Access, Awareness and Education; pages 32-40 |\n\n### ANTI-CORRUPTION (cont.)\n\n| GRI Disclosure | References and responses |\n|----------------|--------------------------|\n| **GRI 103: Management Approach 2016** | |\n| 103-2 The management approach and its components | Our Approach to CR; pages 7-44  \nSourcing; pages 82-84  \nCode of Conduct and Ethics; page 95  \nWalgreens Boots Alliance Code of Conduct and Business Ethics; pages 31-33 |\n| 103-3 Evaluation of the management approach | Our Approach to CR; pages 7-44  \nSourcing; pages 82-84  \nWalgreens Boots Alliance Code of Conduct and Business Ethics; pages 31-33 |\n\n### GRI 205: Anti-corruption 2016\n\n| 205-2 Communication and training about anti-corruption policies and procedures | Direct Response: The Code of Conduct and Ethics extends to all WBA officers and employees no matter where they are located in the world.

An annual internal and external audit process of the management system is not applied across all markets. Systems and approaches are evolving in some markets. Legal agreements limit and exclude certain responsibilities for record keeping or annual training in some markets.

Based on these reviews, we decide to continue, modify or discontinue programs. Community engagement is reviewed in aggregate by operating segments quarterly, to determine alignment with our CSR strategy.\n### LOCAL COMMUNITIES (cont.)\n\nImpact assessments are generally conducted for key national CSR programs and are delivered jointly with the partnering organization. The Healthy Communities section of this report contains a number of examples of the impact of such programs. Many programs have impacts felt on national or global levels, but are enacted most thoughtfully in the communities we serve. In the U.S., Walgreens engagement with local community development programs is decentralized and based on local needs. Employees are involved with local organizations and participate in health-related events and support local causes of greatest priority. Walgreens representatives frequently participate in forums and consortiums to contribute to community consultations and research, which often focus on health disparities and social inequities of vulnerable groups. In the UK, Boots works with long-term national partners to support local communities.\n\n### SUPPLIER SOCIAL ASSESSMENT\n\n#### GRI 103: Management Approach 2016\n\n| 103-1 | Explanation of the material topic and its Boundary |\n|-------|--------------------------------------------------|\n|       | Our Approach to CR;

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on management\u2019s assertion based on our review.\nOur review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) in AT-C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements, and AT-C section 210, Review Engagements. Those standards require that we plan and perform the review to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to management\u2019s assertion in order for it to be fairly stated. A review is substantially less in scope than an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management\u2019s assertion is fairly stated, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. We believe that our review provides a reasonable basis for our conclusion.\n\nIn performing our review, we have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Professional Conduct issued by the AICPA. We applied the Statements on Quality Control Standards established by the AICPA and, accordingly, maintain a comprehensive system of quality control.\n\nThe procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment. In performing our review, we performed analytical procedures and inquiries. For a selection of the Specified Disclosures, we performed tests of mathematical accuracy of computations, compared the specified information to underlying records, or observed the data collection process.\n\nThe preparation of the Specified Disclosures in the WBA 2021 ESG Report requires management to establish and interpret the criteria, make determinations as to the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect reported information. Measurement of certain disclosures includes estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant inherent measurement uncertainty resulting, for example, from accuracy and precision of conversion factors or estimation methodologies used by management. Obtaining sufficient, appropriate review evidence to support our conclusion does not reduce the inherent uncertainty in the amounts and Specified Disclosures. The selection by management of different but acceptable measurement methods, input data or model assumptions may have resulted in materially different amounts or Specified Disclosures being reported.\n\nInformation outside of the Specified Disclosures referenced in Management\u2019s Assertion section of the accompanying WBA 2021 ESG Report, including linked information, was not subject to our review, including the alignment to United Nations (\u201cUN\u201d) Sustainable Development Goals and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (\u201cTCFD\u201d) Disclosure Index and, accordingly, we do not express a conclusion or any form of assurance on such information. Further, any information relating to forward looking statements, targets, goals and progress against goals, was not subject to our review and, accordingly we do not express a conclusion or any form of assurance on such information.\n\nBased on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to management of the Company\u2019s assertion that the Specified Disclosures referenced in Management\u2019s Assertion section of the accompanying WBA 2021 ESG Report for the period or date indicated therein, are presented in accordance with the criteria set forth in Management\u2019s Assertion section of the accompanying WBA 2021 ESG Report.\n\nChicago, IL\nJanuary 26, 2022\n\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\nBasis of Preparation\n\nFISCAL 2021 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) DATA\n\nPART I: BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\nOrganization and scope\nThe Company\u2019s operations are organized into two segments: US and International. WBA\u2019s external performance reporting includes all subsidiaries in which the Company holds a controlling interest. Excluded from the scope of this reporting are entities in which the Company does not have a controlling interest.\n\nThe main areas that are excluded when reporting ESG information externally are:\n\n- Divestments - Businesses that are no longer subsidiaries of the Company at the fiscal year end due to divestment in the reporting year are excluded from current year ESG reporting scope;\n- Business acquisitions - Businesses acquired during the reporting year are excluded from the current year ESG reporting scope. The complete dataset is reported once data for a full year are available;\n- Equity method investments - Equity method investments are excluded from the Company\u2019s external ESG reporting scope;\n- Franchise operations \u2013 Franchise operations run by third parties where a WBA business is the franchisor are excluded from the Company\u2019s external ESG reporting scope;\n- Outsourced activities \u2013 These Outsourced activities are excluded from the ESG reporting scope, except where the outsourcer\u2019s activities are dedicated to the Company\u2019s business and where the associated impacts may be significant to our ESG performance, e.g. for example, third-party product deliveries made exclusively for WBA. The Company\u2019s Code of Conduct and Business Ethics set out the principles for dealing with, and the requirements for, suppliers.\n\nEvery effort is made to ensure that the Company reports accurate data and that processes are designed to support this. In cases where the Company becomes aware of updates to the previous year\u2019s data, it will consider restating data where the changes result in a discrepancy that is material to this ESG report. In these cases, the Company provides details in footnotes to the data tables.\n\nOn June 1, 2021 the Company completed the sale of the majority of the Company\u2019s Alliance Healthcare business as well as a portion of the Company\u2019s retail pharmacy international businesses in Europe (\u201cdiscontinued operation\u201d) to AmerisourceBergen Corporation. Unless otherwise specified, disclosures in this report reflect continuing operations only. Certain prior period data, primarily related to discontinued operations, have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\n\nUse of multiple frameworks\nThe Company has used both standard and non-standard frameworks in its reporting process. For select metrics and KPIs, WBA developed its own standard definitions for reporting its performance data and KPIs (Refer Part II).\n\nThe Company is reporting the material topics, identified during the fiscal year 2021 materiality assessment. The Company follows the Global Reporting Initiative\u2019s definition of materiality, which is different to the definition used for filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Issues deemed material for purposes of this report may not be considered material for SEC reporting purposes.\n\nThe Company reports utilizing frameworks including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and, the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nFor Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, the information has been prepared in accordance with the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition (the GHG Protocol). As described in the GHG Protocol: Corporate Standard, GHG emissions reported under Scope 3 GHG emissions are optional for reporting. The Company is reporting on two of the fifteen Scope 3 categories: Business travel and downstream transportation and distribution (cars, aircraft, trains or by sea) for operations outsourced to third parties where deliveries are made exclusively for WBA businesses. Collectively, the Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition and Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3), Accounting and Reporting Standard are referred to as the GHG Protocol in this document.\n\nReporting of metrics and data\nThe Company has documented definitions and procedures related to ESG data and metrics to ensure completeness and consistency. These procedures provide for the use of estimation and extrapolation techniques in instances in which data is not practicable to source. The Company reviews definitions and procedures on an annual basis.\n\nEND OF SECTION\nPART II - DEFINITIONS OF WBA ESG PERFORMANCE METRICS\n\nWBA reports ESG performance data in total and for certain metrics by segment, consistent with its financial reporting. The Company captures, analyzes and reports data at a detailed level to provide a clear understanding of contributing factors to ESG performance. WBA\u2019s Framework of ESG priorities covers the following key areas:\n\n| Healthy Communities | Contributions are analyzed as follows: |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                     | \u2022 Cash (charitable and other donations) and non-cash (employee time, in-kind donations and management costs) |\n|                     | \u2022 Focus of the organizations contributed to: health, social welfare, education, other (for example, relating to arts, culture, emergency relief, economic development) |\n|                     | \u2022 Employee time (volunteer hours). Please note employee time relates to volunteering hours during paid working time only. |\n\n| Healthy Planet | The three significant sources of CO2e emissions are energy, product delivery and business travel. Emissions are analyzed as follows: |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                 | \u2022 Total emissions by source (energy, product delivery and business travel) |\n|                 | \u2022 Scope (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) |\n|                 | \u2022 Emissions from energy by type: electricity (direct and indirect), gas (indirect), and other (combined heat and power, oil and liquefied petroleum gas) |\n|                 | \u2022 Emissions from business travel, by type: road, air and rail |\n|                 | \u2022 In addition to the above analysis, the Company also discloses the metric, CO2e emissions from business travel per 1,000 employees. |\n|                 | Waste is analyzed as follows: |\n|                 | \u2022 By method of disposal: landfill, incinerated and recycled (includes materials recovered via incineration with heat recovery) |\n|                 | \u2022 By content: hazardous and non-hazardous |\n\n| Healthy and Inclusive Workplace | Employee Turnover |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------|\n|                                 | Diversity of employees (including age group, gender, and leadership level for WBA; race and ethnicity for Retail Pharmacy USA; and gender and race and ethnicity for U.S. pharmacists) |\n|                                 | Employee category (manager, non-manager and senior director and above) |\n|                                 | Employment Type (permanent, temporary, full-time, part-time) |\n|                                 | Percentage of employees under a collective bargaining agreement |\n1. HEALTHY COMMUNITIES\n\nCash donations\n- Charitable cash donation: Cash donated directly by the Company in support of community projects to organizations officially created or legally registered for charitable purposes. Donations from employees, customers and suppliers are not included.\n- Other cash donation: Cash donated directly by the Company in support of community projects to organizations other than those officially created or legally registered for charitable purposes. Donations from employees, customers and suppliers are not included.\n\nNon-cash donations\n- Employee time: Defined as the value of time employees have volunteered to spend on community projects and social welfare programs during paid working time. Employee time is valued at an average staff salary rate and includes employer\u2019s employment taxes, healthcare, social security and Medicare contributions, pension contributions and employer matching 401K contributions.\n- In-kind donations: These are products, equipment, the use of premises or other non-cash items donated to community programs.

Also captured is advertising space in Company magazines (e.g. Boots Health & Beauty magazine) that benefits both the charity and the business. Fifty percent of the advertising costs are included, in line with the London Benchmarking Group (LBG) global standard.\n- Management costs: These are defined as the value of costs incurred planning and managing community projects and social welfare programs and consist of direct expenditure as well as an allocation of relevant overhead and expenses.\n\nGeographic Areas impacted by the Company\u2019s donations\n- Local: A local organization is defined as an organization whose work does not meet the definition of national or international organization.\n- National: A national organization is defined as an organization whose work is focusing on the entire country. For US purposes the entire country is defined as the sizeable majority (more than 75 percent) of the states.\n- International: An international organization is defined as an organization whose work is focusing on more than one country.\n\nOrganizations supported by the Company\u2019s contributions\n- Health: projects include donations made to not-for-profit hospitals, health organizations and other health-related activities.\n- Social welfare: projects include donations made to organizations focused on issues such as homelessness, legal support, domestic violence, the elderly and people with disabilities.\n- Education: projects include donations made to schools, colleges, universities or other projects or organizations that promote education, training or development programs.\n- Other projects: include donations made to organizations or activities not covered by categories above, such as the arts, culture, emergency relief and economic development.\n\nAccess to Affordable and Quality Healthcare\n- Number of new in-store health service locations that increase access\n- Number of collaborations with healthcare service providers covered on the Walgreens app through Walgreens Find Care\n\nConsumer Health Education and Marketing\n- Number of consumers who participate in health education initiatives through clicks on healthcare focused topics on Walgreens.com\n\nOpioid Abuse Prevention\n- Number of Naloxone kits dispensed\n- Total number of take home safe medication disposal kits sent from distribution centers to stores for customer distribution\n\n2. HEALTHY PLANET\n\n2.1 Waste\nWaste reporting is typically reliant on data provided by waste contractors within a country. Normally, waste data measurement is based on metric tonnage as provided by third-party contractors. For sites where the third party\u2019s contract is based on an agreed standard metric tonnage per volume collected, the rate applicable for the year is used as the basis of calculation. For sites where contractor data are unavailable (for example, stores within shopping centers where the Company\u2019s business does not manage the waste contract), estimates are used based on actual data from a store or warehouse of an equivalent size.\n\n- Total waste generated is defined as sum of Hazardous and Non-Hazardous waste sent to Landfill, Incineration with and without Heat Recovery, and Recycled.\n\u2022 Waste sent to landfill is defined as waste produced by WBA operations and sent to landfill for disposal.\n\u2022 Waste sent to incineration is defined as waste produced by WBA operations and sent to incineration, without heat recovery, for disposal.\n\u2022 Materials recovered via incineration are defined as waste produced by WBA operations and sent to incineration via a contractor where energy recovered from the process is used to generate electricity or heat.\n\u2022 Materials recycled are defined as waste produced by WBA operations and sent off-site for recycling.\n\u2022 Hazardous waste as defined by local applicable legislation at the point of generation\n\u2022 Non-hazardous waste as defined by local applicable legislation at the point of generation\n\nKey performance indicators - waste\n1. Hazardous waste as % of total waste\n2. Waste recycled as % of total waste generated\n3. Total waste generated per $ sales (tonnes per $million sales)\n\n2.2 Carbon emissions\nTotal CO2e emitted (in metric tonnes) is calculated using activity data (e.g. amount of fuel used) and applying relevant conversion factors following the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol recommendation and using the most accurate calculation approach available. To reach the most accurate emissions estimations, the latest available specific locally sourced factors are applied, where reasonable. Key performance indicators - emissions\n\nKey performance indicators - emissions\n4. Electricity - green tariff as % of total used (based on kWh)\n5. CO2 emissions from business travel, per 1,000 employees\n6. CO2 tonnes from product delivery per $million sales\n\n2.2.1 Conversion factors\n\u2022 For standard tariff electricity, country specific CO2e conversion factors published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) are used, apart from WBA\u2019s largest territories, the U.S. and the UK. U.S. data are converted using Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Emissions & General Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) specific CO2e factors that take into consideration where the electricity was produced within the country. UK data are converted using the UK Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) CO2e factors.\n\u2022 For passenger air travel, the latest available DEFRA factors are used across all Segments.\n\n\u2022 For all other metrics, conversion factors are applied based on business location. The United States Segment follows the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published factors. The International Segment follows DEFRA published factors. Note: where CO2e factors are not available, CO2 factors are applied as a proxy.\n\u2022 Conversion factors are updated annually to reflect the factors published by the IAE, EPA and DEFRA that are in effect as of 31 August of the reporting year.\n\n2.2.2 Energy\n\u2022 Electricity - The calculation of CO2e from electricity is based on the following factors:\n  \u2022 Standard tariff - Consumption data are converted using the relevant conversion factors as described above. Where data on electricity consumed are not available, an estimate is made based on annual expenditure on electricity. Estimates are based on stores or properties of an equivalent size.\n  \u2022 Green tariff - This is country specific and entered individually by the business. Generally, in cases where the standard tariff is already subsidized, this is accounted for using the grid average conversion factor.\n  \u2022 Onsite Combined Heat & Power (\u201cCHP\u201d) plant - This is specific to the Company\u2019s onsite energy plant in Beeston, Nottingham, UK and based on a calculation defined by the GHG Protocol that uses actual electricity and heat output figures.\n\u2022 Gas and other - Consumption data are converted using the relevant conversion factors as described above. Where data on actual consumption (in mWh) are unavailable, an estimate is made based on annual expenditure.\n\n2.2.3 Outbound product delivery\nThis covers the resulting CO2e emissions from delivery of products to stores and to customers. This includes deliveries by own-fleet vehicles and for operations outsourced to third parties where deliveries are made exclusively for WBA businesses and backhaul deliveries for other companies. This excludes deliveries from third-party suppliers to Company warehouses, cross-dock centers or direct to stores. The amount of CO2e emitted is calculated using activity data and applying the relevant conversion factors as described above.\n\u2022 Own-fleet vehicles (including leased vehicles):\n  \u2022 Drivers with fuel cards - fuel consumed captured by third-party fuel billing\n  \u2022 Drivers without fuel cards - distance captured\n\u2022 Third-party vehicles - where the delivery is made exclusively for a WBA business, captured by either third-party kilometer data or third-party liters of fuel used.\n\n2.2.4 Business travel\nThe amount of CO2e emitted from travel undertaken by employees for work or business purposes is calculated using activity data and converted to emissions applying relevant conversion factors as described in section 2.2.1.\n\n\u2022 Road travel \u2013 car travel undertaken by employees for business purposes\n  \u2022 Employees with fuel cards - captured by third-party fuel billing\n  \u2022 Employees without fuel cards - captured by Company expense systems, using kilometers travelled\n\n\u2022 Air travel \u2013 calculated using third-party (e.g. travel service provider) data on kilometers travelled other than for non-commercial flights, which are calculated using third-party data on fuel consumed\n\n\u2022 Rail travel - calculated using third-party (e.g. travel service provider) kilometer data\n\n2.2.5 Carbon emissions by scope\nThe amount of total CO2e emitted from energy, product delivery and business travel categorized into scopes as defined by the GHG Protocol.\n\n\u2022 Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions occurring from sources that are owned or controlled by the Company are emissions from self-generated electricity and self-generated heat or steam; and, from combustion of natural gas and oils in owned or controlled boilers and furnaces, owned vehicles used for product delivery and owned cars or aircraft used for business travel. Fugitive emissions resulting from the use of refrigeration and air conditioning equipment are not included as the Company evaluates their effects on its operations.\n\n\u2022 Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions are emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, purchased heat or purchased steam consumed.\n\n\u2022 Scope 3: Indirect GHG emissions that are a consequence of the activities of the Company but occur from sources not owned or controlled by the Company. WBA currently reports on business travel and downstream transportation and distribution, which are the most relevant sources of emissions. These are emissions from third-party product delivery and business travel undertaken by vehicles (cars, aircraft or trains) not owned by the Company.\n\n3. HEALTHY AND INCLUSIVE WORKPLACE\nEmployee: An employee is a person employed by WBA on a full- or part-time basis, for an indefinite or fixed term.\n\nEmployee Turnover\n\u2022 Voluntary Turnover: Employees who have left the Company voluntarily (not transfers) as a percent of the average active and leave headcount of employees for the reporting period. The reporting period is based on the prior 12 months. Interns, as identified by job title, are excluded from turnover.\n\n\u2022 Involuntary Turnover: Employees who have left the Company (not transfers) as a percent of the average, active and leave headcount of employees for the reporting period. The reporting period is the same as above. Some reasons that are not included in turnover, which coincides with industry standards for defining turnover are the following: Permanent reduction in force, Employee death, Store or department closures.\n\nEmployees by gender\n\u2022 Men: total number of employees who identify themselves as male.\n\u2022 Women: total number of employees who identify themselves as female.\n\u2022 Undisclosed: total number of employees who have not disclosed their gender.\n\nEmployees by age group\n\u2022 Employees under 30 years old: the number of employees who are younger than 30 years old at period end.\n\n\u2022 Employees between 30 \u2013 50 years old: the number of employees who are between 30 and 50 years old at period end including 30 and 50 year old employees.\n\n\u2022 Employees over 50 years old: the number of employees who are older than 50 years old at period end.\n\nEmployee category\n\u2022 Manager employees: the number of employees who have at least one direct report.
