How might we help people see data in new ways, discover insights, and unlock endless possibilities? These are the questions that drive us, that shape our mission\u2014and our service takes many forms.\n\nTechnologically, we\u2019re solving some of the world\u2019s most challenging problems here at Oracle. We\u2019re building a new generation of modern, secure healthcare information systems that will help healthcare providers lower costs, improve patient outcomes, and drive community health efforts that result in new treatments and better public health policy. We\u2019re helping countries in Africa manage large-scale vaccination programs in the cloud, contain major diseases, and save lives. Worldwide, our technology is enabling organizations large and small, across industries, to operate sustainably and develop solutions to tackle climate change.\n\nPhilanthropically, we\u2019re investing in social impact organizations whose work is critical to solving the challenges facing society today and tomorrow. Organizations funded by Oracle Giving are achieving transformational change in areas ranging from food security to educational equity to environmental conservation. In fiscal year 2022, we gave more than US$20 million to nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations around the world that are as rigorous and effective as they are caring.\n\nWe\u2019re swift to act in times of crisis. In response to the war in Ukraine, we gave US$1 million to World Central Kitchen, International Medical Corps, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR). We then matched donations from Oracle employees to help people affected by the war, together contributing another US$1.6 million. We also donated technology and consulting services to UNHCR and the Norwegian Refugee Council, streamlining their operations and enabling them to focus on the humanitarian crisis on the ground.\n\nWe\u2019re volunteering our time and talents. We began fiscal year 2022 with a 24-hour celebration of the Oracle Volunteering program\u2019s 30th anniversary. Every year, Oracle Volunteers support students and educators, protect nature, and strengthen communities by helping people in need. They know that social change takes inspired action, sweat, and skill. More and more, we\u2019re inviting nonprofit partners to bring us their problems and then matching them with teams of Oracle Volunteers who use their business and technical skills to design solutions that accelerate positive change.\n\nWe\u2019re committed to education and have been for more than three decades. Beyond our contributions to the field through Oracle Giving and Volunteering, we run our own initiatives. Oracle Academy, which provides educational institutions with free access to a variety of curricula and technologies, including Oracle Cloud, expanded its offerings in fiscal year 2022 and received wide recognition for its impact. Oracle Education Foundation introduced a new curriculum combining design thinking with futures thinking, plus coding and physical computing, preparing young people to design and build what\u2019s needed next. Both of our programs give special attention to young women, girls, and other historically marginalized student populations because the playing field isn\u2019t going to level itself.\nCulturally, we\u2019re supporting diversity and inclusion, teamwork, continuous learning, and the overall well-being of our employees. These efforts earned us awards from the Great Place to Work Institute as well as a 100 percent rating on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation\u2019s Corporate Equality Index for the 16th consecutive year.\n\nEnvironmentally, we\u2019re doubling down on our commitment to protect and restore the earth. Our ambitious sustainability goals include a commitment to power all operations, including Oracle Cloud, with 100 percent renewable energy by 2025. Further, we\u2019re committed to cutting emissions in half across our operations and supply chain by 2030 and to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Worldwide, we\u2019re embedding sustainability across our enterprise and delivering innovative cloud technology to accelerate meaningful change for our customers and our planet.\n\nThroughout this report, we demonstrate Oracle\u2019s commitment to being at the forefront of environmental and social impact. We know that to tackle the world\u2019s most important problems our technology, philanthropy, sustainability, and culture all need to be in alignment and our workforce needs to reflect the diversity of the communities we live in, work in, and serve. Everyone here is on a mission to serve a transforming world and to help our customers do amazing things.

Oracle donated US$1 million to four relief organizations: the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), International Medical Corps, and World Central Kitchen, all of which are helping to relieve suffering and save lives by providing emergency medical services, food, and shelter to those in need. Oracle employees worldwide gave generously too, and with Oracle's 1-to-1 match, we raised another US$1 million to support these organizations.\nAiding affected employees\n\nFrom the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Oracle provided affected employees with financial assistance, evacuation and relocation support, accommodations both within and outside of Ukraine, travel services, and around-the-clock emergency support. Beyond this, employees around the world donated to Oracle Cares, our employee assistance fund that supports colleagues in need. In fiscal year 2022, our colleagues donated more than US$293,000.\n\nUsing Oracle technology for good\n\nFurthering our support for the people of Ukraine, we\u2019ve deployed our technology to make an impact where the need is greatest. We provided technology and pro bono consulting to the Norwegian Refugee Council and UNHCR to help them implement cloud-based solutions, enabling both organizations to streamline their operations and focus on the growing refugee crisis on the ground. We also offered our technology and cybersecurity capabilities to the government of Ukraine at no cost and suspended all billing to our Ukrainian customers to help ensure their continued access to our products and services.\nEmployees making a difference\n\nOur employees have been taking action to support the Ukrainian cause from the very beginning of the conflict.

Its mission is to help young people develop the technical acumen and creative confidence to design outstanding solutions to people\u2019s needs and the world\u2019s problems.\n\nImpact at a glance\n\n83% of students feel more comfortable with technology in FY21\u201322\n\n80% of students feel more confident applying design thinking skills in FY21\u201322\n\n23,325+ volunteer hours contributed to date\nWhat we do\n\nOracle Education Foundation provides classes at the intersection of coding, physical computing, design thinking, and futures thinking. Each class teaches a technology, then asks students to apply that tech to a design challenge and create prototype solutions. Foundation educators lead classes, and Oracle Volunteers coach students. We engage students aged 14 to 18 through partner schools and nonprofits.\n\nDesign thinking, meet futures thinking\n\nDesigning the future can feel daunting. Even now, new tech and new environments are testing us in new ways. Young people need the creative confidence and ethical clarity to design and build a vibrant future for all. So, with the Institute for the Future\u2019s help, we incorporated future skills\u2014such as how to make sense of loopy, complex systems, build a crew, and befriend the machines\u2014into our classes.\nThe future of learning is hybrid\n\nPre-pandemic, we provided in-person classes in North America. Throughout the pandemic, we used Zoom, Miro, and other tools to deliver our classes and engage students and volunteers virtually. The upside of lockdown? Oracle Volunteers around the world coached students in six countries across the Americas. As we emerge from the pandemic, we're keeping the best of both virtual and in-person learning.\n\nExpanding the program throughout the Americas\n\nIn fiscal year 2022, the Oracle Education Foundation expanded its program to Latin America in partnership with Junior Achievement Americas. We delivered virtual Game Design classes for JA students in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Peru. Students created games that address issues faced by local nonprofits and nongovernmental organizations and the communities they serve, including Oracle Giving grantee PROA Institute.\n\u201cAs a volunteer with the Oracle Education Foundation, it\u2019s rewarding to journey with the students as they learn new concepts, apply design thinking, and persevere through any setbacks to reach their final presentation.\u201d\n\nPamela Luis, Manager, Software Development, Oracle\nStudent prototype spotlight\n\n**Game Design: Develop future skills**\n\nStudents design and build a game based on a future scenario that helps them break out of habitual thinking and imagine new possibilities. As they take their game from idea to prototype, students learn coding concepts in Phaser, an HTML5 game development framework. No first-person shooter or fighting games here\u2014students in our classes design games that teach, inspire empathy, and build resilience.\n\n**Neural Networks: Befriend the machines**\n\nStudents learn how to use neural networks to build their own image classifier. They first learn how to train a network and then use that knowledge to create an image classifier that helps solve a real-world problem. In this context, students grapple with ethical questions about how we do and do not want to use AI, now and in the future.\nWeb Design: Make yourself known\n\nBeing able to build a personal brand and present your best self through a portfolio is an essential skill today. In this class, students design and code a website from scratch, curating their brand and accomplishments.

Our partnership with Oracle provides access to incredible resources, the best of which are Oracle employees, who generously volunteer their time and talents to provide d.tech students with real-world learning experiences.\u201d\n\nKen Montgomery, Cofounder and Executive Director, Design Tech High School\nContinuous adaptation\n\nBy design, d.tech was built to respond to the needs of both students and educators. Amid the pandemic, d.tech reopened its campus, offering a flexible schedule that enabled students to focus on their daily academic and extracurricular priorities.\n\nThe school's success wouldn't have been possible without the d.tech faculty, whose relentless optimism and commitment to their students transformed a moment of crisis into an opportunity for growth and learning.\n\nStudents making a difference\n\nA social media alert to help people find COVID-19 vaccine appointments, a tutoring club to help Afghan refugees practice speaking English, an environmental advocacy project showcasing the impact of recycling through a colorful mural\u2014these are just a few of the projects d.tech students are contributing to the world, each one making a positive difference.\nIntersession: Learning beyond campus\n\nThe Intersession program is a defining d.tech educational experience. Three times a year, for 60 hours each time, students explore new disciplines and industries through classes offered by nonprofits, businesses, and professionals. Students choose from a wide range of classes such as photography, entomology, cooking, and event venue operations. Every Intersession, Oracle Education Foundation offers classes on technologies such as neural networks, web applications, data science, and more.\n\nOracle Volunteers at d.tech\n\nOracle Volunteers feel at home at d.tech, donating their time and talents to support students year-round. Last year, Oracle Volunteers developed software to improve scheduling for Intersession classes. The application, called Exploration Station, streamlined the student and faculty experience and enabled the program to continue virtually and in person throughout the pandemic.\nLearn more about our impact\n\n- Oracle Academy\n- Oracle Academy Member Success Stories\n- About Oracle Academy\n- Oracle Social Impact Datasheet (PDF)\n- CDP climate change response (PDF)\n- Corporate Social Responsibility Report\u2014India\n\nPhoto credits: 2.

Oracle Volunteers lead and participate in virtual and in-person projects with hundreds of nonprofits and public institutions year-round. They support students and educators, protect nature and wildlife, and strengthen communities by helping people in need. Globally, the pandemic hit volunteering hard\u2014but at the same time, it inspired action and empathy. Today, as its effects ebb, volunteerism is on the rise again.\n30 years of Oracle Volunteering\n\nWe began the year with a 24-hour celebration in honor of the Oracle Volunteering program's 30th anniversary. More than 2,000 employees on six continents participated in virtual sessions that featured executive kickoffs for each region, volunteering activities, inspirational speakers, festive games, and brainstorming about how to do more good in the world.\n\nWatch the video\nWhere we focus our efforts\n\nLearn how Oracle Volunteers support students and teachers.\n\nDiscover how Oracle Volunteers help restore our planet.\n\nSee how Oracle Volunteers help others.\nSocial impact in action\n\nSkills-based philanthropy\n\nSocial change takes time, common cause, inspired action, money, and often sweat. It also takes skill. More and more, we're inviting our nonprofit and NGO partners to bring us their problems and matching them with teams of Oracle Volunteers who use their business and technical skills\u2014plus our Oracle Cloud Free Tier\u2014to design solutions that help accelerate positive change.\n\nDiversity and inclusion in action\n\nOracle employees bring their whole selves to work, and many enjoy the affinity of employee resource groups (ERGs). Every year, our ERGs create Oracle Volunteering projects that celebrate belonging and giving back, including Martin Luther King Jr. service week and events for International Women's Day and Autism Awareness Month, among others.\n\nRead how Oracle Volunteering supports diversity\nBuilding culture through volunteering\n\nToday, Oracle teams are often distributed across regions and time zones. The Oracle Volunteering program brings far-flung teammates together to do good. Camaraderie is a natural byproduct of volunteering with colleagues, whether virtually or in person. Of course, the world benefits too, and when volunteers work together to support the causes they care about, the ripple effect can be profound\u2014for global society and for team culture.\n\nCommunity building at Oracle\n\nDoing well by doing good\n\nEvery full-time Oracle employee may volunteer up to 40 hours a year during their scheduled work time, and many Oracle Volunteers contribute hundreds of hours beyond that. Through Oracle Giving, we match our employees\u2019 charitable donations to causes around the world up to US$1,000 per employee per year\u2014and more in times of crisis. Why? Because ensuring that our people feel empowered to do good is part of our business.\n\nLearn more about employee giving\nOracle Volunteering global initiatives\n\nFocus on Environment\nMarch\u2013April:\nEmployees team up with environmental organizations to take action for a healthy planet.\n\nFocus on Education\nAugust\u2013September:\nEmployees give special attention to supporting students, schools, and education-focused nonprofits.\n\nFocus on Community\nNovember\u2013December:\nEmployees share their time and resources to help those in need.\n\nPhoto credits: 1.

As learning environments evolve, Oracle Volunteers are committed to stepping up and lighting up the young hearts and minds that will brighten the future.\n\nHelping young people be future-ready\n\nNow more than ever, young people need the creative confidence, sense of self-efficacy, and skills to build a vibrant future in which they can thrive. That's why the Oracle Education Foundation engages Oracle Volunteers as coaches in multiday classes at the intersection of coding, physical computing, design thinking, and futures thinking. Volunteers donated nearly 8,400 hours in fiscal year 2022.\nEmpowering the next generation of entrepreneurs\n\nOracle Volunteers help activate the entrepreneurial potential of youth from underrepresented communities. This includes mentoring girls as they build applications to address issues facing their communities, helping young people design digital games that educate and inform, and equipping students with business and financial skills. Organizations we engage with include Halogen Foundation, Junior Achievement, and Technovation.\n\nProviding youth with online safety resources\n\nWith the ever-expanding role of technology in education, keeping students safe online is essential. More than 2,500 students from 10 schools in India took part in the Cyber Bright, Cyber Right project. Oracle Volunteers taught students how to maintain privacy on social media, prevent cyberbullying, and navigate the internet safely. We also engage with organizations including BGS National Public School, Lakshmipat Singhania Education Foundation, and Salwan Junior School, among others.\nPreparing students for successful careers\n\nOracle Volunteers lead by example and share their career experience with the next generation. Through career panels, mock interviews, and resume review workshops, Oracle Volunteers guide and inspire young people to pursue careers in technology and beyond. Organizations we engage with include Braven, Code2College, Design Tech High School, and Ponelopele Oracle Secondary School.\n\nSupporting students with disabilities\n\nEquitable and inclusive learning experiences are essential to meeting the needs of students with disabilities. To promote inclusivity, Oracle Volunteers have facilitated sign language sessions for kids who are deaf or hard of hearing and recorded interactive audiobooks to benefit children with autism. Organizations we support include the Brooklyn Autism Center, Cheshire Disability Trust, Chosen Children Village Foundation, Texas Kids Read, and UNICEF India.\nEnvironmental volunteering\n\nYear-round, Oracle Volunteers rally for the earth, clean up shorelines to keep plastics out of our oceans and waterways, keep clothes out of landfills, and restore and regreen the natural world. These are just a few of the many ways they care for our planet. Explore more below.\n\n\u201cOracle Volunteering\u2019s rally called There\u2019s No Planet B was a great opportunity to share the eco-friendly actions we take in our day-to-day lives and learn new practices we can implement.\u201d\n\nRonaldo Santos, Technical Account Manager, Oracle Brazil\nBanding together for Earth Day\n\nFocus on Environment, our global initiative that runs from March 1 to April 30 annually, coincides with Earth Day by design. In 2022, Earth Day also coincided with National Volunteer Week in the US, and Oracle Volunteers got especially busy. As the world began to reopen, Oracle Volunteers everywhere came together to restore our planet. They cleaned up beaches, planted trees and seedballs, tidied up their digital storage to reduce their carbon footprints, and much more.\n\nRead the story\n\nRallying for the environment\n\nAcross Latin America, Oracle Volunteers participated in a multiweek rally called There\u2019s No Planet B. They learned about minimizing food waste while maximizing nutrition, making their own earth-friendly shampoo and cleaners, diverting goods from landfills, and generally walking more lightly on the earth. Organizations we engage with include Bandera Azul Ecol\u00f3gica, Gastromotiva, and Vegetarianos Hoy.\nProtecting our oceans and waterways\n\nEvery piece of plastic or other litter you pick up is one less piece that ends up in the ocean. Year-round, Oracle Volunteers lead cleanups of their local beaches and fresh waterways, as well as cities, neighborhoods, and parks. Organizations we engage with include Keep Austin Beautiful, Keep Britain Tidy, Keep Massachusetts Beautiful, Ocean Conservancy, and SEGO Initiative.\n\nRestoring local ecosystems\n\nGlobally, Oracle Volunteers participate in hands-on ecological restoration efforts to renew and rewild damaged ecosystems. This includes making and planting seedballs, removing invasive, non-native plant species, restoring trails, establishing community gardens, and more. Organizations we engage with include Bhumi, Los Angeles Community Garden Council, SayTrees, and The Trail Foundation.\nDiverting waste from landfills\n\nAround the world, solid waste generation rates are rising. This is the opposite of what needs to happen. Oracle Volunteers help tackle the problem by raising awareness and collecting and donating gently used items such as clothes, books, and electronics for reuse. Done responsibly, this can keep enormous amounts of waste from ending up in landfills or incinerators. Organizations we engage with include BRED Diocesano de Guadalajara A.C., Instituto Gerando Falc\u00f5es, Instituto PROA, and Japan Refashion association.\n\u201cI chose to volunteer to support Ukrainian refugees when the war started, hosting refugees at my home and preparing bags of essential supplies for those at the border. I\u2019m proud that Oracle empowers employees to volunteer for causes we believe in to help make the world a safer place.\u201d\n\nBogdan Turtoi, Social Impact Community Leader, Romania, Oracle\nCrocheting for impact\n\nOctober is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and for weeks in advance, Oracle Volunteers crocheted items that cancer survivors could keep close to their hearts\u2014literally. A group of dedicated fiber artists wove lightweight, customized breast prostheses for women who have undergone mastectomies. These \u201cknockers\u201d followed patterns from Knitted Knockers, a nonprofit that designs patterns and distributes prostheses to breast cancer survivors.\n\nStepping up for the community in times of crisis\n\nIn times of distress and tumult, Oracle Volunteers rise to the occasion. Employees collected and delivered essential supplies to Ukrainian refugees, created welcome cards for newly resettled families from Afghanistan, and designed posters to raise awareness of the challenges faced by survivors of domestic violence. Organizations we engage with include Asocia\u021bia Magic, the Casa Ioana Association, Jiyan Foundation for Human Rights, and Miry\u2019s List.\nFostering connections with our elders\n\nOracle Volunteers respect and value elders and actively connect with them, and as COVID-19 continued to cause heightened isolation and vulnerability among older people, they redoubled their efforts.

We\u2019re committed to building a more sustainable future and empowering our employees to do the same.\n\u201cOracle is committed to embedding sustainability across our enterprise and delivering innovative cloud technology to accelerate meaningful change.\u201d\n\nSafra Catz, CEO, Oracle\n\nA message from Oracle\u2019s CSO\n\nWhen it comes to sustainability, Oracle is action oriented and outcome driven. We know that ensuring the health of our planet calls for bold and urgent action. To this end, we\u2019ve embedded sustainability throughout our organization and business processes, including our value chain. This means creating a more circular economy and effectively managing climate-related risks companywide. It means empowering our employees to make decisions that put the planet first. It means providing our customers globally with a zero-emissions cloud by 2025. And it means committing to achieving net zero by 2050 and halving our value chain emissions by 2030.\n\nOracle was founded in 1977 with a goal to organize large amounts of data in a way that allowed for efficient storage and quick retrieval. Decades later, we still recognize the value of using data to solve some of the planet\u2019s most complex problems. Companywide, we rely on data to operationalize sustainability, protect natural resources, reduce waste, and achieve energy efficiency.\n\nWhile what we do ourselves is of paramount importance, helping our customers on their sustainability journeys has an impact many times greater than our own. I encourage you to read our customer stories and learn more about the technology solutions, such as sustainable computing infrastructure, that are helping them innovate, build sustainable supply chains, and perform environmental, social, and governance (ESG) planning and reporting. Many of our industry solutions, including our Energy and Water solutions, are also playing a critical role in driving the transformation needed to ensure a more sustainable future for our planet.\n\nWe believe access to data and technology can help today\u2019s sustainability leaders get better information and make more informed decisions. Together, we can make a difference.\n\nJon Chorley\nChief Sustainability Officer, Oracle\nLearn more about Oracle's commitment to sustainability, including how we help our customers on their sustainability journeys.\n\nView the full repository of Oracle's policies, disclosures, and reports.\n\nSee our year-over-year progress and detailed sustainability metrics.\n\n2025 sustainability goals\n\n- **100%** renewable energy use for all operations, including Oracle Cloud\n- **100%** of key suppliers have an environmental program in place\n- **80%** of key suppliers have emissions reduction targets in place\n- **33%** reduction in potable water use per square foot\n- **33%** reduction in waste to landfill per square foot\n- **25%** reduction in employee air travel emissions\nNet zero\n\nOracle has set a target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and to halve the greenhouse gas emissions across our operations and supply chain by 2030, relative to a 2020 baseline.
