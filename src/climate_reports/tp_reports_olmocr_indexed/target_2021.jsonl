Meet the cover artist.\nA Message From Our Chairman and CEO\n\nMoving Target Forward\n\n2021 marked another year of rapid growth on top of 2020\u2019s record results. We kept investing in our team, who are the key to our success. Today, as we continue navigating headwinds, our team is even more closely connected through our culture \u2014 and more committed to serving families and communities than ever before.\n\nThat ambition \u2014 to serve people and bring joy \u2014 has been at the heart of our business for 60 years. It is the foundation of our decades-long legacy of corporate responsibility and sustainable practices, which we built upon in 2021 with the launch of Target Forward. This latest chapter in our sustainability strategy redefined what it means to apply our size, scale, purpose and values toward benefiting the world around us. And we rigorously organized around our vision: to co-create an equitable and regenerative future for all.\n\nTarget Forward influences every corner of our business, informing how we source and design products, power our operations, select partners, invest in our team and communities, and countless other decisions. And it advances progress on Target\u2019s environmental, social and governance (ESG) priorities.\n\nA vision guided by clear priorities\n\nToday, we\u2019re taking an even more focused and rigorous approach to ESG across our business, including this inaugural ESG report, which builds on our long history of corporate responsibility reporting. It reflects our belief that transparency, prioritization, ambitious goal-setting and continual learning are essential to holding ourselves accountable and achieving transformative change. Our ESG priorities align to our Target Forward vision, while addressing other topics that are important to us and to our stakeholders, including cybersecurity and governance.\n\nNeither our strategy nor goals are designed to be static. As with any ambitious undertaking, we will continually listen, evaluate and adjust as we learn and respond to evolving dynamics.\n\nResults driven by a culture of care\n\nAll of these priorities, including our ambition to accelerate opportunity and equity, start with supporting the well-being, health and safety of our team. In 2021, we invested in ongoing pandemic support, including frontline bonuses; an evolved staffing model meant to provide more stable hours and paychecks; and benefits designed to increase equitable opportunities, including debt-free education assistance. Fortune ranked Target second among large companies to work for, and this year, we announced a new starting wage range of $15 to $24 per hour and expanded access to healthcare benefits to even more of our team and their families.\n\nWe built on our long-standing diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) strategy and deepened our commitments as an anti-racist organization. We\u2019ve long set ambitious, multi-year DE&I goals, and we met or exceeded nearly all of our latest round \u2014 increasing promotions and reducing turnover for team members of color, while making strides in more diverse representation across the team, especially in our officer ranks. And we\u2019re on-track to meet commitments from our Racial Equity Action and Change (REACH) committee, including investing $2 billion in Black-owned businesses by 2025. We\u2019re proud of our progress and the new connections and commitments we\u2019re making through these efforts, but this work is never finished.\n\nAs the following pages show, we also advanced on efforts to reduce environmental impact through renewable energy projects, circular design and more. For instance, as we work to become a net zero enterprise by 2040, we\u2019re driving sustainability and emissions accountability across our supply chain, and we retrofitted our first net zero energy store. Our team is designing with more regenerative, recycled or sustainably sourced materials, including in guest-favorite owned brands such as Cat & Jack, Universal Thread and Everspring.\n\nBringing our impact to scale\n\nTarget has entered our third fiscal year since the pandemic began. In that time, we\u2019ve grown by tens of billions of dollars and invested more than ever in our team. We\u2019ve emerged a larger and stronger company, with even more loyal guests turning to Target as a source of joy and stability in an ever-evolving world.\n\nThat growth translates to greater responsibility \u2014 and opportunity. Through our ESG and Target Forward commitments, and our perpetual focus on learning and improvement, we remain focused on bringing our impact to scale. And as we connect our bold approach to sustainability to the power of collaboration and a team that is committed to caring, growing and winning together, I am more optimistic than ever about our ability to drive positive outcomes for all.\n\nBrian Cornell\nChairman and CEO\nUnveiled in June 2021, Target Forward is our vision for co-creating an equitable and regenerative future together with our guests, partners and communities. Amanda Nusz, who oversees our Target Forward strategy, offers her insights on Target Forward\u2019s progress to date and how Target is striving to reach its bold ambitions.\n\nWhat\u2019s most exciting about the Target Forward strategy a year into the rollout?\n\nI\u2019m delighted that team members see Target Forward as a natural extension of our culture. Our teams understand that it\u2019s integral to how we strengthen and expand our business with a clear vision for our future.\n\nCaring for people and the planet has been central to Target\u2019s mission for decades, and Target Forward builds upon that legacy by establishing tangible, measurable goals aligned against critical ambitions. One key to the widespread enthusiasm for Target Forward is that the vision was wholeheartedly embraced and championed by Target\u2019s leadership. They are deeply invested in this strategy and the actions we are taking today are destined to shape a more sustainable and equitable world tomorrow.\n\nWhat has led to the high internal engagement?\n\nOur Target Forward strategy was created with input from team members, partners and communities, as well as insights from guests. This collective approach has made the strategy and work meaningful for all.\n\nGiven the interconnected Target Forward framework and goals, it\u2019s nearly impossible for any team to work on the strategy in isolation. Team members see how Target Forward focuses on the issues they care about and are energized by the fact that the actions we are taking today are destined to shape a more sustainable and equitable world tomorrow.\n\nWhat are some of the biggest accomplishments stemming from Target Forward?\n\nI\u2019m encouraged that since its launch only a year ago, our teams have taken significant steps \u201cforward\u201d with Target Forward across all three of our ambitions.\n\nOne example of how we are designing and elevating sustainable brands is the launch of Target Zero, an initiative to help our guests more easily find hundreds of products across our assortment that create less packaging waste.\n\nWith respect to furthering diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I), Target now offers a debt-free education assistance benefit to our more than 340,000 full-time and part-time team members.\n\nIn March 2022, we completed the conversion of our Vista, California, store to become Target\u2019s first net zero energy store \u2013 furthering our journey toward net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.\n\nThese are just a few of the ways we are bringing solutions to life that better serve our communities and the environment. Dozens of Target Forward initiatives are underway, and we are in the process of finalizing the roadmaps for others, an effort led by hand-selected teams of experts both within and outside of Target. As we remain dedicated to learning through this process, we expect to find the pathway to our goals continuously evolving, based on new information and as we respond to those changing dynamics.\n\nWhat role do external partners play in the success of Target Forward?\n\nTarget Forward hinges on the input and participation from hundreds of Target vendors and suppliers, plus countless organizations we partner with in the communities we serve. To achieve aggressive goals, and to maximize the impact of our efforts at scale, Target Forward relies on a diverse set of stakeholders. It\u2019s the only way to achieve meaningful social and environmental change.\n\nBy seeking differing viewpoints and engaging experts to address challenges and opportunities, Target Forward is poised to succeed in helping tackle such critical issues as racial equity, plastic waste and climate change.\n\nThis community-centric approach is especially important in achieving DE&I within our enterprise, and within the community at large. Guided by our Racial Equity Action and Change (REACH) committee, we launched the Target Scholars Program in partnership with United Negro College Fund, which is providing 1,000 first-year students at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) with $5,000 scholarships, as well as mentoring and internship opportunities. I\u2019m pleased to report we are further extending support for these students for the next three years, through graduation.\n\nTarget Forward isn\u2019t just a part of our business. It is our business. And multifaceted partnerships are the linchpins to building a better future for generations to come.\n\nAmanda Nusz\nSenior Vice President of Corporate Responsibility & President of the Target Foundation\nWho We Are\n\nOur purpose\nOur purpose is to help all families discover the joy of everyday life.\n\nOur values\nWe bring our purpose to life through our values of inclusivity, connection and drive.\n\nOur culture\nOur culture is to care, grow and win together:\n\n- **Care:** We show up for each other, make people the priority and treat each other with respect.

That collaboration has continued to deepen as we work to achieve the milestones we\u2019ve set.\n\nAt the same time, we\u2019re identifying new, collaborative ways of working internally to develop clear goal roadmaps and successfully execute them. Our commitments will evolve and refine as we continually learn and bring together information from various sources, such as new scientific research, stakeholder expectations and business demands. We will provide updates on our Target Forward efforts, as well as our complete portfolio of goals, in our annual ESG report and at www.target.com/targetforward.\n\nOur vision\nTarget Forward\u2019s vision is to co-create an equitable and regenerative future together with our guests, partners and communities.\n\nOur ambitions\nWe are working toward three critical ambitions:\n\n1.

Target has committed to being a net zero enterprise by 2040 \u2014 zero waste to landfill in U.S. operations and net zero emissions across both our operations and supply chain, inclusive of scopes 1, 2 and 3.\nWe aim to center our business strategy, investments, engagement and reporting on the environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics that are most important to our business and our stakeholders across our value chain.\n\nAs we seek to accelerate our progress \u2014 and leverage our size and scale to benefit people, the planet and our business \u2014 our ESG priorities guide our actions in a cohesive, compelling and risk-minded manner. These priorities also informed the ambitions and goals we\u2019ve set through Target Forward.\n\nOur ESG priorities were confirmed and updated as a result of an assessment in conjunction with the launch of Target Forward. We regularly collect stakeholder feedback as a part of our ESG priority assessments.\n\nEnvironmental\n\n- **Circularity**\n  - Product & packaging design\n  - Guest & supplier engagement\n  - Waste elimination & reduction\n\n- **Climate**\n  - Greenhouse gas emissions\n  - Efficiency & energy management\n  - Climate-related risks & opportunities\n  - Net zero emissions target & reduction strategy\n  - Climate adaptation\n\n- **Regenerative resources**\n  - Environmental impacts of products\n  - Responsibly sourced commodities\n  - Materials and resource use\n  - Water use & management\n  - Chemicals\n  - Biodiversity\n\nSocial\n\n- **Human capital management**\n  - Labor practices\n  - Compensation & benefits\n  - Employee well-being\n  - Workplace health & safety\n  - Talent & development\n  - Non-discrimination\n\n- **Serving communities**\n  - Community impact\n  - Product quality & safety\n  - Responsible marketing\n  - Economic opportunity\n  - Employment\n  - Access to products & services\n\n- **Diversity**\n  - Board and workplace diversity\n  - Elevating equity in communities and supply chains\n\nGovernance\n\n- **Ethical business**\n  - Transparency & reporting\n  - Government advocacy\n  - Privacy & cybersecurity\n\n- **Responsible supply chains**\n  - Purchasing practices\n  - Traceability & sustainability\n  - Human rights\n  - Forced labor\n\nOur ESG priorities identified and categorized in this assessment are increasingly interconnected and can often impact each other. As such, they should not be viewed in isolation.\nWe engage with a diverse group of stakeholders around the world, including the people who manufacture the products we sell, our team members and guests, the communities we work in, the nonprofits we partner with and the investors who make our work possible.\n\nWe use their valued perspectives to inform our approach to systemic change, and continue to foster these collaborations, even though COVID-19 restrictions have required many events and appointments to become virtual.\n\nIn the following table, we summarize our stakeholder engagement during fiscal year 2021.

Our focus is on leveraging our size and scale to enable positive change so that future generations may thrive in a world fueled by a zero-carbon, responsibly sourced and circular economy. By partnering and innovating throughout our supply chain, and keeping inclusivity at the center of what we do, we\u2019re striving to address the most pressing environmental challenges of our time.\n\nOur work contributes to the following SDGs:\n\n- 2: Zero Hunger\n- 6: Clean Water and Sanitation\n- 7: Affordable and Clean Energy\n- 12: Responsible Consumption and Production\n- 13: Climate Action\n- 14: Life Below Water\n- 15: Life on Land\n- 17: Partnerships for the Goals\n\nFrameworks reported on:\n\n- GRI\n- SASB\n- TCFD\n\nTotal renewable energy consumption\n\n- RECs 34%\n- Grid electricity 18%\n\n52% FY2021\n\nChange in market-based scope 1 and 2 emissions (versus a 2017 baseline)\n\n-32.0%\n\nFY2020: -26.7%\nFY2019: -10.5%\n\nTarget has committed to being a net zero enterprise by 2040\n\nPercentage of owned brand paper-based packaging sourced from sustainably managed forests\n\n86%\n\nFY2020: 63%\nFY2019: 51%\n\nWaste diverted from landfill\n\n80.8%\n\nFY2020: 80.1%\nFY2019: 77.5%\n\nRecognition for ESG performance\n\n- CEBA: No. 8 Top 10 U.S. Energy Buyers 2021\n- U.S. EPA Green Power Partnership: No. 1 National Top 100 Retail, No. 3 Top 30 Onsite Solar Generation, No. 14 Fortune 500\n\n5 2022 ESG: metrics for renewable energy consumption and scope 1 and 2 is for domestic (U.S.) operations that we have operational control under The Climate Registry General Reporting Protocol. Does not include any metrics related to Shipt.\n6 Brand we own, source and sell.\n7 We utilize credible independent third-party certifications to ensure sustainable sourcing of forest products.\n8 By 2040, Target commits to being a net zero enterprise: zero waste to landfill in its U.S. operations and net zero emissions across both its operations and supply chain, inclusive of scopes 1, 2 and 3.\nInvesting in Circularity\nCircular design is a critical part of how we will deliver our Target Forward goal to design and elevate sustainable brands\\(^9\\) that are affordable, inclusive and inspirational, and essential to our ambition to innovate to eliminate waste.\n\nWe are partnering across our supply chain to design solutions within our products, packaging and operations that use fewer materials, remain in use longer, and make reuse and recycling easier, while continuing to provide ease and convenience for our guests. Our inclusive design approach, Design for All, supports our evolution toward circularity and maintains our focus on providing joyful experiences for our guests.\n\nClimate Action\nThe impacts of climate change are profound and increasingly being felt by people across the world, particularly society\u2019s most marginalized groups.\n\nAs a trusted, leading brand, Target knows that urgent action is needed. That\u2019s why we have committed to being a net zero enterprise\\(^10\\) by 2040.\n\nTo meet the challenge of climate change, we\u2019re increasing energy efficiency, using more renewable energy and implementing new practices across our value chain to reduce our carbon footprint. We are also using scenario analysis as a tool to assess the potential implications of climate-related risks.\n\nBy collaborating with key partners across our value chain and joining climate coalitions, we are accelerating decarbonization at an industrywide scale.\n\nResponsible Resource Use\nOur planet provides the raw materials needed for our products. It is our responsibility to work to protect nature, the people who produce materials and the communities in which they live.\n\nBecause many impacts associated with our products originate in our supply chains, we collaborate with suppliers to create shared positive impact and enhance transparency, leveraging our internal policies to uphold robust raw material sourcing standards. We have commitments for the responsible sourcing of forest products, chemicals, cotton, animal welfare, palm oil and seafood, with efforts aimed at nurturing biodiversity, advancing water stewardship and driving best practices in chemicals use.\n\nOur diligence to source responsibly is part of our Target Forward commitment to fostering a sustainable and inclusive supply chain that is just and equitable for all workers.\n\n---\n\n\\(^9\\) Brands or manufacturers with industry-leading products or services that have context-specific environmental and/or socially beneficial features, backed by credible standards or impact metrics.\n\n\\(^10\\) Net zero, as defined, is achieved when a company\u2019s scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are reduced to a level that is consistent with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway, and any residual emissions are removed from the atmosphere through either nature-based or technological carbon removal solutions (e.g., forestry, regenerative agriculture, carbon capture technology), by no later than 2050. Target has committed to being a net zero enterprise by 2040 \u2014 zero waste to landfill in U.S. operations and net zero emissions across both our operations and supply chain, inclusive of scopes 1, 2 and 3.\nProduct and packaging design\n\nWe are enhancing the environmental performance of our products and packaging, leveraging our size and scale to innovate lower-impact solutions, including alternatives to plastic.\n\nWe have plans for 100% of our owned brand products to be designed for a circular future by 2040. We also plan to:\n\n- Offer two circular owned brands by 2025.\n- Reduce annual total virgin plastic by 20% in our owned brand Food, Beauty and Essentials businesses by 2025, measured against our total plastic packaging baseline volume in these categories in 2020.\n- Have 100% of our owned brand plastic packaging be recyclable, compostable or reusable by 2025, eliminating problematic plastics in owned brand packaging.\n- Make owned brand packaging with 20% post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic content.\n\nWe look to embed closed loop principles right from the design stage. This means prioritizing the use of regenerative, recycled and sustainably sourced materials, and creating products that are durable, recyclable and easily repaired or have modular component parts.\n\nPromoting circular design\n\nTo harness the power of our team, we created and implemented a Circular Design Guide \u2014 a web-based training hub for team members to learn about circular design and its impact.\n\nIn addition, our Circular Design Calculator helps team members determine key factors when choosing materials. The tool was leveraged in 2021 to help our supply chain team create a baseline of the water and greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts of its shipping materials.\n\nThese resources have supported our work across various areas, including:\n\n- Our Universal Thread line, where we are developing denim jeans to contribute to a closed loop model, using materials such as recycled cotton and recycled polyester.\n- The rethinking of Guest Service GiftCards (GiftCard with Purchase & Merchandise Return) designed by our prepaid team, replacing single-use plastic with a durable, paper-based alternative. The revamped GiftCards launched in select stores in March 2022.\n- The fixtures used for the launch of Ulta Beauty at Target. Steel, aluminum and UV-stable plastics were selected for their reusability, and component sections were made easy to separate to aid repair or replacement.\n\nAs a stakeholder in the CircularID Initiative and the development of the Circular Product Data Protocol, we conducted an early feasibility test using digital identities, in partnership with EON in 2021. The test, using Target\u2019s owned brand Wild Fable, enabled us to understand the process and explore future scalability and key performance indicators (KPIs) for the use of digital identities for Target products. Read more about our circular design principles.\n\nAlternative materials and recyclable plastic packaging\n\nTo address concerns about plastic packaging impacts, we\u2019re working to reduce virgin plastic use. Key to our progress is pre-competitive collaboration across the supply chain, as well as exploration of alternative materials that considers the full environmental implications of substitutes.\n\nTarget in action\n\nTarget Zero\n\nIn February 2022, we launched Target Zero, an initiative to help guests find products in more sustainable packaging. The collection features products with packaging designed to be refillable, reusable or compostable, or made from recycled content or materials like aluminum, steel or glass.\n\nThe initiative launched with 10 Beauty brands and 65 products in stores, as well as several hundred items across Beauty, Personal Care and Household Essentials on Target.com. The momentum was maintained in April, with new products across our owned brand Everspring, including concentrated items in minimal packaging.\nProduct and packaging design\n\nAs members of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and a signatory of the New Plastics Economy and the U.S. Plastics Pact, we look to eliminate problematic and unnecessary plastic waste through reduction and innovation. We have made 2025 commitments to:\n\n- Eliminate problematic plastics in owned brand packaging.\n- Make owned brand packaging with 20% PCR plastic content.\\(^{11}\\)\n- Design 100% of owned brand packaging to be recyclable, compostable or reusable.\n\nProgress against our goal to reduce the total volume of virgin plastic packaging in our owned brand Food, Beauty and Essentials businesses by 20% by 2025 will be measured against our total plastic packaging baseline volume in these categories for 2020 (45.1 metric tonnes) by 2025. To enhance our efforts, Target became a supporting partner of the Closed Loop Partners Composting Consortium in 2021. The initiative aims to advance recovery of compostable packaging, convening a cross-industry working group to create a framework for strengthening U.S. composting infrastructure and systems. We also joined the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials to gain access to educational information on biomaterials.\n\nAs digital sales continue to grow, we are also improving our transit packaging materials, including replacing bubble wrap with a 100% recyclable expanded paper cushioning wrap for all products shipped from stores starting in 2020.\n\nIn November 2021, our packaging team identified an opportunity to replace unrecyclable PET trays and packaging used for our Wondershop ornaments with recyclable corrugate material. This change is expected to impact our 2022 Winter Holiday assortment, eliminating over 200 metric tonnes of plastic.\n\n**Guest and supplier engagement**\n\nAchieving a more circular economy requires collaboration, and we maintain several channels for engaging guests and suppliers in sustainability efforts. As a founding partner of the Consortium to Reinvent the Retail Bag, in 2021 we launched pilots of several innovations to replace single-use plastic bags in three Target stores across Northern California. Working alongside the Consortium\u2019s two other founding partners \u2014 CVS Health and Walmart \u2014 the pilots sought to refine four of nine winning solutions from the Consortium\u2019s global Beyond the Bag innovation challenge. The findings will inform future work to eliminate and replace single-use plastic bags with reusable alternatives.\n\nWe continue to use the How2Recycle label on our owned brand packaging to make recycling options clearer for guests.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{11}\\) We set our commitment to PCR in 2019 but acknowledge that some states will have higher thresholds for PCR content by 2025.\nWaste elimination and reduction\n\nWe seek to reduce operational waste, to partner with upstream suppliers on similar commitments and to activate efforts throughout our value chain.\n\nAs part of our Target Forward journey, we aim to achieve zero waste to landfill in our U.S. operations by 2030, striving to adopt an approach of \u201cinnovate to eliminate.\u201d\n\nBy 2030, Target plans to divert 90% of waste from landfill through reuse, recycling, donation and reduction strategies.\n\nZero waste involves the conservation of all resources by means of responsible production, consumption, reuse and recovery of products, packaging and materials without burning and with no discharges to land, water or air that threaten the environment or human health, as established by the Zero Waste International Alliance. The threshold to be considered \u201czero waste\u201d is normally set at a minimum of 90% diversion rate.\n\nBy 2025, we plan to have 50% of owned brand apparel, footwear, home and hardlines suppliers by spend achieve zero manufacturing waste to landfill (ZMWL). 12\n\nWaste elimination and reduction strategies\n\nVendor partnerships\nRobust vendor partnerships help enhance our waste reduction, recycling and reuse programs. Currently, 71.4% of reverse-stream material that comes back to Target is in apparel and home.\n\nWork toward our ambition for key suppliers to achieve ZMWL is already ongoing in owned brand footwear. In 2019 and 2020, we co-created the Shoe Waste Factory program with the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America to drive continuous improvement in establishing waste management systems and divert waste from landfill. In 2021, 25 factories participated in the program, with 21 of those factories achieving zero waste to landfill12 \u2014 collectively diverting 5,602 tons of waste. We will continue to work with participating factories to support their ongoing success, look to add additional factories to the program in the future and explore ways to use the footwear model to reduce waste across other owned brand categories.\n\nWe have service providers who manage 100% of our electronics waste domestically \u2014 no materials are exported \u2014 while batteries are recycled by our hazardous waste vendors. We engage companies, including Novolex, Fresh Pak, Potential Industries and Waste Management, to recycle our packaging film.\n\nWe are also continuing to pilot a textile-to-textile recycling project with Circo, converting end-of-season, overstock and end-of-life textiles into new raw materials. Our test project is turning the recycled raw material into Target-branded T-shirts for team member volunteering events.\n\nWhile mannequins in our stores are currently made with polyurethane, a nonrecyclable virgin plastic, we are expanding our vendor capabilities in North America to use recyclable plastic and recycled content. Additionally, we have partnered with mannequin manufacturers closer to our stores to reduce shipping distance and set up reclamation and recycling processes at these facilities to create a circular waste stream.\n\nTake-back programs\nSelect take-back programs make recycling products and packaging simpler and more convenient for guests. In the majority of our stores, we offer front-of-store recycling for plastic bags and some electronics, and hold twice-yearly child car seat recycling events.\n\nRead more about our approach to take-back programs as part of our circularity strategy.\n\nEliminating food waste\nAligned with our Target Forward goal to achieve zero waste to landfill12 in our U.S. operations by 2030, we plan to reduce operational food waste by 50% by 2025. So far, we have improved our forecasting and replenishment strategy, and enhanced reporting and processes. With the support of our partner Anthesis, we have also established our food waste footprint and baseline year (2017), utilizing the World Resources Institute (WRI) Food Loss & Waste Protocol. We can now start to measure, track and address our food waste \u201chot spots.\u201d\n\nShould any of our stores and supply chain facilities have surplus food, they can donate eligible safe-for-consumption products to their local Feeding America member food bank. This partnership allows us to support the communities we serve while reducing our environmental impact. In 2021, we donated 106 million pounds of food, which is equivalent to 88 million meals. For food that cannot be donated, organics recycling or composting programs are currently available at 712 facilities.\n\nTo continue to support our zero waste to landfill12 goal, in 2022, we will also launch an additional 700 stores on an organics recycling program with our partner Divert Inc.\n\nRead more about our vendor partnerships, take-back programs and food waste reduction efforts as part of our circularity strategy.\n\n12 The conservation of all resources by means of responsible production, consumption, reuse and recovery of products, packaging and materials without burning and with no discharges to land, water or air that threaten the environment or human health, as established by the Zero Waste International Alliance. The threshold to be considered \u201czero waste\u201d is normally set at a minimum of 90% diversion rate.\nWaste elimination and reduction\n\nResponsible waste disposal\n\nWhen we can\u2019t eliminate waste, we try to divert it from landfill. In 2021, 68.2% of construction waste and 80.8% of operational waste was diverted from retail operations. Our properties team has been recycling eligible roof membrane from reroofing projects since 2007, and in 2021, this amounted to 1,189 tons of material.\n\nResponsible disposal of waste\n\nTarget is piloting an innovation project in four locations that involves placing a camera in compactors and using artificial intelligence (AI) technology to detect recyclable materials. From this data, we can provide store-level reporting to drive process improvements. If this pilot is successful, we plan to roll out the technology enterprise-wide to detect other recyclable materials.\n\n| Metric | FY2021 | FY2020 | FY2019 | Framework |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Weight of operational waste generated (tons) | 1,111,107 | 1,068,746 | 966,362 | 306-2 |\n| Non-hazardous | 1,111,107 | 1,068,746 | 966,362 | 306-2 |\n| Hazardous | 2,459 | 1,534 | 1,219 | 306-2 |\n| Percentage of waste diverted from landfill | 80.8% | 80.1% | 77.5% | 306-2 |\n| Operational waste | 80.8% | 80.1% | 77.5% | 306-2 |\n| Construction waste | 68.2% | N/A | 60.2% | 306-2 |\n| Weight of material diverted from landfill (tons) | 900,100 | 808,860 | 749,648 | 306-2 |\n| Operational material | 900,100 | 808,860 | 749,648 | 306-2 |\n| Construction material | 1,189 | N/A | 5,871 | 306-2 |\n| Weight of non-hazardous operational waste reused (tons) | 201,700 | 168,606 | 175,879 | 306-2 |\n| Plastic hangers | 14,385 | 10,387 | 4,996 | 306-2 |\n| Donations | 60,243 | 53,720 | 52,442 | 306-2 |\n| Salvage | 127,072 | 104,499 | 118,441 | 306-2 |\n| Weight of non-hazardous operational waste recycled (tons) | 690,694 | 633,945 | 568,407 | 306-2 |\n| Cardboard | 633,056 | 573,633 | 514,564 | 306-2 |\n| Plastic bags and shrink wrap | 12,370 | 11,538 | 10,282 | 306-2 |\n| Plastic, glass and aluminum cans and bottles | 3,771 | 4,673 | 4,480 | 306-2 |\n| Electronics | 11,259 | 9,706 | 2,859 | 306-2 |\n| Metal | 10,099 | 13,552 | 14,921 | 306-2 |\n| Paper | 1,793 | 2,794 | 3,121 | 306-2 |\n| Used cooking oil | 182 | 165 | 168 | 306-2 |\n| Other | 18,164 | 17,884 | 18,012 | 306-2 |\n\n13 In 2020, Target generated no construction waste due to project cancellations and a shift to special project work.\n14 Target does not ship waste internationally.\nNet zero emissions target and reduction strategy\n\nWe are committed to avoiding, reducing and removing emissions as we work toward a target of net zero.\\textsuperscript{15}\n\nOur emissions commitments are ambitious, and we recognize the challenge ahead in reducing our impact while still growing our business. But this does not deter us from our work to avoid, reduce and remove emissions from the value chain. Through Target Forward, we are adopting sustainable practices such as increasing our use of renewable energy and driving energy efficiency.\n\nWe have joined the Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C and Race to Zero campaigns so that our emissions contribute to no more than 1.5\u00b0C warming, as outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and drive meaningful change across our sector.\n\nThe timeline shows how we have ramped up our ambition, starting in 2019, and how we are looking to achieve net zero GHG emissions\\textsuperscript{15} across scopes 1, 2 and 3, by 2040 (10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement).\n\n\\textsuperscript{15} Net zero, as defined, is achieved when a company\u2019s scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are reduced to a level that is consistent with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway, and any residual emissions are removed from the atmosphere through either nature-based or technological carbon removal solutions (e.g., forestry, regenerative agriculture, carbon capture technology), by no later than 2050. Target has committed to being a net zero enterprise by 2040 \u2014 zero waste to landfill in U.S. operations and net zero emissions across both our operations and supply chain, inclusive of scopes 1, 2 and 3.\nGreenhouse gas emissions\n\nWe continuously strive to reduce the carbon footprint of our direct operations and supply chain, and have developed an approach to reducing emissions across our enterprise.\n\nPartnering with suppliers on emissions reduction strategies\n\nWe have been working for many years with various third-party partners on initiatives to reduce scope 3 emissions and track progress against our goals. The production, distribution, use and disposal of products are responsible for most of our GHG emissions, so we have set several targets to reduce emissions across our supply chain.\n\nThrough our climate supplier engagement program, we continue to support suppliers as they calculate their carbon footprint, set science-based emission reduction targets, track progress and drive collaborative action. Around 32% of our top 80% of suppliers by spend had set emissions reduction targets by the end of 2021.\n\n| Our emissions impacts | Scope | Definition | Our impact |\n|-----------------------|-------|------------|------------|\n| 1                     | Direct emissions | Target operates a variety of stores, offices, supply chain facilities, data centers and off-site warehouses. These sites create direct emissions through the activities under their control. They also consume electricity, which generates indirect emissions during its production. Together, scope 1 and 2 emissions account for approximately 3% of our emissions footprint. |\n| 2                     | Indirect emissions | Our upstream and downstream value chain activities cover manufacturing, product distribution, business travel, guests using our products and other indirect sources. These types of indirect emissions account for around 97% of our GHG emissions. Specifically, goods and services that we purchase account for approximately 47% of our scope 3 emissions, and the remaining 53% of scope 3 emissions come from use of sold products, transportation and other activities. |\n\nTo date, our suppliers have reported net reductions in their scope 1 and 2 emissions equivalent to 5.3% of the baseline established in 2017. We use the Higg Facility Environmental Module (FEM) and CDP to capture allocated emissions reductions from our suppliers, and these reductions were reported from third-party verified datasets or were validated internally by Target. In 2020, the number of suppliers reporting on their 2019 reductions increased by over 70%. Our suppliers are in the process of completing their 2021 data submissions.\n\nThe business environment in 2021 impacted our growth and therefore our emissions. Total sales increased by $12.2 billion, from $92.4 billion in 2020 to $104.61 billion in 2021, which contributed to a 4.5% rise year-over-year in scope 3 emissions. As we work on our ambitious climate goals and partner with our suppliers to make reductions, we expect to see those efforts reflected in our future emissions performance over the medium and long term.\n\nKey upstream and downstream interventions\n\n- **Regenerative agriculture:** We co-funded a five-year, $8.5 million project with Cargill, McDonald\u2019s and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help Nebraska farmers advance soil health.\n- **Responsible sourcing:** With multiple partners and stakeholders, Target is working to meet responsible sourcing and climate change commitments for palm oil, forest products, cotton, coffee and seafood.\n- **Sustainable logistics:** We seek opportunities to work with third-party logistics providers to improve the efficiency with which they move our products.\n- **Packaging:** In 2020, we announced ambitious 2025 commitments to eliminate problematic plastics in packaging with the potential to reduce energy use and GHG emissions.\n- **Guest engagement:** The use of sold products accounts for approximately 35% of our scope 3 carbon emissions \u2014 we have an opportunity to educate our guests on reducing emissions, such as through the purchase of ENERGY STAR-certified products.\n\nRead more about our investments into supply chain improvements.\nChanges in sales from 2017 to 2021 drove a 26.2% increase in retail PGS emissions. Supplier-reported emission reductions and greening of the electricity grid accounted for a 5.3% reduction in emissions in 2020. In 2020, suppliers reported 2019 scope 1 and 2 reductions through CDP and Higg FEM increased by over 70%.\n\n2020 total scope 3 figure has been restated to 12.0% from the 16.5% reported last year. This restatement is due to: LCA emission factor updates and more precise weight calculations.\n\nOur business travel emissions estimate includes passenger miles on commercial airlines. We used emissions factors from the U.S. EPA Climate Leaders Business Module. Global warming potentials are from the IPCC\u2019s Second Assessment Report. We did not apply a radiative forcing adjustment to the verified airline travel emissions. Corporate jet emissions are included as part of our scope 1 calculations.\n\n| Metric | FY2021 | FY2020 | FY2019 | Framework |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (mtCO2e) | 2,159,457 | 1,883,429 | 2,298,450 | TCFD 305-1 |\n| Location-based | 1,746,742 | 2,192,085 | 2,433,234 | TCFD 305-1 |\n| Market-based | -32.0% | -26.7% | -10.5% | TCFD 305-1 |\n| Change in scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from 2017 baseline (market-based) | 0.00570 | 0.00620 | 0.00763 | TCFD 305-4 |\n| GHG emissions intensity (scope 1 and 2, market-based) (mtCO2e/sq. ft.) | 734,799 | 699,877 | 752,552 | TCFD 305-4 |\n| Gross quantity of direct (scope 1) GHG emissions (mtCO2e) | 274,862 | 251,325 | 238,899 | TCFD 305-4 |\n| Natural gas | 1,988 | 1,776 | 1,758 | TCFD 305-4 |\n| Stationary diesel | 1,363 | 1,664 | 1,955 | TCFD 305-4 |\n| Mobile (diesel, gasoline, jet fuel) | 29,699 | 22,554 | 41,470 | TCFD 305-4 |\n| Refrigerants | 426,887 | 422,558 | 468,470 | TCFD 305-4 |\n| Quantity of scope 1 biogenic CO2 emissions (mtCO2e) | 0 | 0 | 0 | TCFD 305-4 |\n| Corporate emissions rate for EPA16-applicable refrigeration systems (greater than 50 lbs) | 12.8% | 13.3% | 15.4% | TCFD 305-4 |\n| Pounds of ODS R-22 refrigerant removed and replaced with lower Global Warming Potential alternatives | 17,575 | 19,712 | 27,243 | TCFD 305-4 |\n| Gross quantity of indirect (scope 2) GHG emissions (mtCO2e) | 1,424,658 | 1,492,208 | 1,680,682 | TCFD 305-2 |\n| Scope 2 total (location-based) | 1,011,943 | 1,183,552 | 1,545,898 | TCFD 305-2 |\n| Electric (location) | 1,420,075 | 1,488,213 | 1,676,067 | TCFD 305-2 |\n| Electric (market) | 1,007,360 | 1,179,557 | 1,541,283 | TCFD 305-2 |\n| Steam | 2,648 | 2,605 | 2,852 | TCFD 305-2 |\n| Chilled water | 1,905 | 1,390 | 1,762 | TCFD 305-2 |\n\n16 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n17 Target sales increased in 2001, resulting in an associated increase in scope 3 emissions. However, sales increased at a higher rate than emissions during this period, showing a relative slowdown of emissions compared to sales growth.\n18 2020 total scope 3 figure has been restated to 12.0% from the 16.5% reported last year. This restatement is due to: the application of The Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) factors by year to the Use of Sold Product category; U.S. EPA WARM factor decreases in End of Life; and an adjustment to remove emissions Target is already accounting for in the PGS category.\n19 Changes in sales from 2017 to 2021 drove a 26.2% increase in retail PGS emissions. Supplier-reported emission reductions, which are part of our net emissions calculations, were not yet reported for 2021 at the time of publication and are not reflected in this figure.\n20 Supplier-reported emission reductions and greening of the electricity grid accounted for a 5.3% reduction in emissions in 2020. In 2020, suppliers reported 2019 scope 1 and 2 reductions through CDP and Higg FEM increased by over 70%.\n21 PGS was restated from 29,177,000 mtCO2e when the footprint was re-run this year. This includes reductions from greening of the grid and supplier reported reductions. Major drivers of change include LCA emission factor updates and more precise weight calculations.\n22 Upstream transportation does not currently include the emissions associated with chilled, temperate or frozen truck movements, which is conservatively estimated to be less than 7% of Target\u2019s annual sales. Target has taken action to address this gap in measurement.\n23 Our business travel emissions estimate includes passenger miles on commercial airlines. We used emissions factors from the U.S. EPA Climate Leaders Business Module. Global warming potentials are from the IPCC\u2019s Second Assessment Report. We did not apply a radiative forcing adjustment to the verified airline travel emissions. Corporate jet emissions are included as part of our scope 1 calculations.\nEfficiency and energy management\n\nWe\u2019re working to manage energy use, improve efficiency and transition to renewable energy to help reduce the impact of our operations and our suppliers\u2019 facilities.\n\nOur internal Sustainable Building Council, a cross-functional team within Target Properties, coordinates sustainability strategies and helps develop priorities and roadmaps to meet our long-term goals.\n\nRenewable energy\n\nWe plan to obtain 100% of the electricity needed for our operations from renewable sources by 2030 and have set an interim goal of 60% by 2025. We commit to contracts for off-site renewable energy and rooftop solar projects at our facilities. By the end of 2021, we had installed solar at 560 sites.\n\nIn 2021, we signed several renewable power purchase agreements, including a wind energy project in Texas (140 MW) and a solar energy project in Ohio (100 MW). Our portions of several contracted projects in Texas, Florida and Nebraska began producing renewable energy for commercial operation. All these projects now contribute toward Target\u2019s renewable energy portfolio. We are also engaging supply chain partners in our efforts and, by 2025, aim to have at least 50% of the energy used in strategic and joint business partner owned operations come from renewables.\n\nElectric vehicles\n\nWe are also helping fight climate change through our electric vehicle (EV) charging program. Many of our guests want to switch to EVs but worry about finding places to charge. By collaborating with organizations such as Tesla, Electrify America, EVgo and ChargePoint, almost 1,400 charging spaces are now available across 159 Target sites as of year-end 2021.\n\nStores and refrigeration\n\nWe remain committed to HFC-free refrigeration systems whenever technically feasible, with a long-term strategy to have all stores converted to natural refrigerants24 by 2040, aiming to reduce our direct operations\u2019 emissions by an expected 20%.\n\nWe are also building a portfolio of highly energy-efficient stores by continually adopting new technologies and operating procedures. Target has earned ENERGY STAR certification for more than 1,550 facilities and was recognized as an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year in 2022, the seventh straight year we have received this accolade.\n\nTarget in action\n\nTarget\u2019s first net zero energy store\n\nIn support of our commitments to use more renewable energy and reduce our carbon footprint, we unveiled our first-ever net zero energy store25 in March 2022.\n\nThe retrofitted site, in Vista, California, was designed to generate more renewable energy than it uses, and to transmit that surplus back to the local grid. More than 3,400 solar panels across its roofs and carport canopies will power the store and its heating, ventilation and air conditioning system, while CO2 will now be used as a natural refrigerant. We intend to roll out this natural refrigerant26 across our business by 2040, aiming to reduce our direct operations\u2019 emissions by an expected 20%.\n\nEnergy consumption\n\n| Metric | FY2021 | FY2020 | FY2019 | Framework |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Total energy consumption (GJ) | 20,153,181 | 19,454,429 | 20,040,246 | SASB CG-MR-130a.1.

No combustion is used to meet onsite energy demands.\n27 Renewable electricity includes renewable energy credits (RECs) from Target\u2019s onsite and off-site projects, as well as electricity that we receive from renewable energy generation serving the electric grids where Target facilities are located. Data sources include: Target\u2019s 2021 fiscal year electricity consumption data; Target\u2019s 2021 RECs; and the Center for Resource Solutions (CRS) Utility Grid Accounting methodology for renewable mix, published in the latest Edison Electric Institute (EEI) Utility Electricity Mix Database.\n28 The CRS Utility Grid Accounting methodology for renewable mix, adopted by CDP, The Climate Registry and RE100, is a more granular method, applying a regional and utility-specific method as published in the latest Edison Electric Institute (EEI) Utility Electricity Mix Database versus the national data used previously. This results in a utility grid renewable mix of 17.7% in FY2021.\n29 Excludes grid mix renewables.\n30 The scope of this data is U.S. operations only, but international offices account for less than 1% of our overall electricity consumption.\nClimate-related risks and opportunities\n\nIn addition to climate change mitigation efforts, we seek to fortify our business by addressing risks and building resilience.\n\nTarget\u2019s corporate responsibility, government affairs, properties, and responsible sourcing and sustainability teams coordinate our climate change strategy, identify key initiative areas, assess risks and opportunities, and implement the company\u2019s response (see Governance).\n\nPolicy advocacy on climate\n\nWe continue to urge the U.S. Government to address climate change, and directly engage with policymakers at federal, state and local levels to urge climate action, recognizing it as a threat to our business. Read more about our advocacy approach to climate-related issues.\n\nWe track energy and carbon regulation, and related proposals, at the U.S. federal and state levels to identify opportunities for expanding our energy commitments and those of our suppliers.\n\nWe use an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program to identify, prioritize and address a broad range of risks that could directly or indirectly impact our organization. Overseen by our Chief Legal and Risk Officer, ERM provides regular updates to senior leadership and our Board of Directors, and specifically the Audit & Risk Committee.\n\nWe assess climate, forests, water and other natural resource-related risks according to the impact on our business, team members and guests. Each risk may impact factors such as sales, price stability, competitive advantage, stores, guests, communities and suppliers, and those impacts may vary in magnitude, duration or dependency. We also assess impact based on existing crisis preparedness or the ability to develop such contingency and resiliency plans.\n\nClimate adaptation\n\nAs we build out our net zero21 goal roadmap, we will continue to evaluate our climate-related risks and opportunities in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) (see our TCFD Index). The physical, financial and transitional risks and opportunities posed by climate change are factored into our management system, assessed for two time horizons (0\u20133 years and 3+ years), and prioritized based on impact and probability.\n\nOur sustainability team conducts periodic climate-related risk and opportunity assessments. Having identified climate risks using our initial 2019 TCFD findings, we engaged an independent third-party consultant to conduct an assessment in 2022 aligned to the TCFD risks and opportunities taxonomy. As such, a number of transition risks and physical risks were included as part of our assessment. Transition risks encompass what may occur as a result of a transition to a low-carbon economy, and physical risks include both acute and chronic risks, such as natural disasters (acute) and longer-term impacts of a shift toward a warming climate (chronic). Opportunities considered relate to Target\u2019s efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change.\n\nWe disclose the impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities within our annual CDP Climate Response and leverage what we learn to advance our climate mitigation and resilience strategies. We will also continue to develop our own reporting based on best practice guidance.\n\nWe continue to engage with policymakers to urge climate action, and work with NGOs and trade associations such as the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA) to increase access to renewable energy and reduce members\u2019 carbon emissions. Target is also a member of Employers for Renewable Energy (ERE), a cross-industry coalition co-founded by RILA. ERE helps businesses that support state policies enabling greater customer choice of renewable energy and competition among producers.\n\nThe impact of unpredictable weather\n\nWe operate in many communities that have been impacted by extreme weather events, including tornadoes and hurricanes, floods, winter storms and wildfires. The number of such events has risen from two in 2007 to 20 in 2021.\n\nTarget tracks weather-related events and natural disasters that trigger an emergency response. These events can threaten the physical well-being of stores, employees and products but may also damage infrastructure, often leading to power outages that can spoil food and render our stores inoperable.\n\nOur Corporate Monitoring Center identifies man-made or natural disaster risks, enabling us to identify and develop responses to material threats. When climate-related events occur, our risk systems enable a quick response by accounting for team members using mass communications, ceasing operations where necessary and funneling resources and aid to the affected area.\nWe are aware our products have some associated environmental impacts, but we take pride in our efforts to minimize these effects as much as possible. We also seek to use our scale to create new systems with far-reaching positive results.\n\nWe put these approaches into practice by:\n\n- Designing more of our products and packaging for a circular economy.\n- Driving progress against goals to use lower impact materials in our products.\n- Partnering to minimize environmental releases of fiber fragments and microplastics.\n- Following internal and industry best practice standards regarding prohibiting use of unwanted chemicals.\n\n### Audits and verifications\n\nOur Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability audit program monitors the locations that produce our owned and exclusive brands, as well as those that produce national brand products for which Target is the importer of record. Environmental management indicators include possession of the appropriate permits, proper waste management methods, safe chemical usage and responsible wastewater stewardship practices.\n\nTo do business with us, Tier 1 and Tier 2 factories must complete an annual Higg Facility Environmental Module (FEM) self-assessment. Environmental standards outlined in our Standards of Vendor Engagement (SOVE) hold these factories accountable to environmental compliance and promote continuous improvement. 3,317 factories were audited in FY2021, and we did not have any Zero Tolerance Environmental SOVE principle violations.\n\nIf any issues are found during verification by a third party, we tailor our response to the circumstances. Some zero-tolerance violations could deactivate the factory from our list, while for other issues, we will work with the supplier to help them achieve compliance within an agreed-upon time frame. Read more about audits and continuous improvement.\n\n### Environmental responsibility in the supply chain\n\n| Metric | FY2021 | FY2020 | FY2019 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Percentage of supplier factories that have completed the Higg FEM self-assessment (or equivalent environmental data assessment) | | | |\n| Tier 1 apparel factories | 98% | 85% | 78% |\n| Tier 2 fabric mills, packaging factories and trim factories | 90% | 56% | 48% |\n| Average number of environmental issues per audit | | | |\n| China | 0.6 | 0.6 | 1.5 |\n| Southeast Asia | 0.6 | 0.8 | 1.7 |\n| The Americas | 0.4 | 1.2 | 1.0 |\n| India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Egypt and Turkey | 0.5 | 0.7 | 2.0 |\n| Other | 0.7 | 0.9 | 1.6 |\n| Percentage of new suppliers screened using environmental criteria | 100% | 100% | 100% |\n\n32 Target defines significant negative environmental impact as any violation that falls under the Environmental SOVE principle.\nWe drive efforts internally and through our supply chain to source materials and commodities in increasingly responsible ways.\n\nOur standards, goals and commitments include:\n\n- By 2030, Target intends for the leading raw materials (e.g., forest products, cotton, etc.) that go into our owned brand products to be 100% recycled, regenerative or sustainably sourced.\n- Being committed to sourcing 100% of our cotton more sustainably for owned and exclusive brand products by 2022 by participating in programs designed to improve cotton growing practices and working conditions.33\n- Sourcing all owned brand paper-based retail packaging from sustainably managed forests by 2022.\n- Rolling out implementation of our Forest Products Policy to Threshold and Smith & Hawken brands by the end of 2022.34\n- Our seafood sustainability commitment to include best practice requirements for the use of transshipment in tuna supply chains.\n- Implementing an animal welfare policy; moving to source only cage-free shell eggs, pending available supply, by 2025; and by year-end 2022, aim to have 100% of Good & Gather brand fresh pork produced using open pen gestation systems. Good & Gather currently represents the vast majority of all fresh pork sold at Target.\n\nAs we look to 2022 and beyond, we will continue to encourage national brand pork suppliers to further reduce and eliminate the number of days sows are housed in gestation crates. Find updates related to this goal and other food animal welfare commitments on our website.\n\n**Standards and certifications**\n\nThird-party standards help provide confidence in the practices used in our supply chain and help encourage positive change. To guide sourcing decisions for our owned brands, our suppliers utilize certifications including:\n\n- Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)\n- Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)\n- Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC)\n- Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP)\n- Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)\n- Fair Trade USA\n\nWe communicate sustainability-related information of interest to our guests using clear icons on product labels to highlight such certifications.\n\n**Forestry products**\n\nIn our forestry supply chains, we use chain-of-custody certifications wherever possible to confirm that we source from well-managed forests. We prioritize FSC standards and currently have 1,500 FSC-certified owned brand items.\n\nWe recently participated in a pilot study with auditing and risk mitigation organization Preferred by Nature. The study aimed to identify ways to minimize forest product risk where chain-of-custody wood supplies are not available.\n\nRead more about our Forest Products Policy.\n\n**Palm oil**\n\nSince 2019, our suppliers\u2019 procurement of RSPO physically certified (Mass Balance, Segregated or Identity Preserved) palm oil, palm kernels and derivatives increased by 37%, and now spans 3,000 products in relevant owned brand categories.35\n\nWe have set a goal of using RSPO physically certified palm oil, palm kernels and derivatives in relevant owned brand product categories, and aim to trace palm oil to mill level by end of 2022.\n\nWorking closely with our partners at the Earthworm Foundation, we achieved traceability to the mill level for 76% of our palm oil supply in 2021 and are working to trace the remaining volumes by the end of 2022.\n\n**Transparent supply chains**\n\nWith retailers increasingly keen to understand how and where products are made, Target is accelerating its implementation of traceability programs. We are initially focusing on cotton due to its prevalence in our assortment, the regulatory requirements surrounding cotton and our commitment to source cotton more sustainably for owned brand and exclusive national brand products by 2022. Eventually, we aim to achieve full visibility of where the cotton we use is grown, collaborating with farmers, brands, other retailers and organizations that share our commitment. We also intend to track and validate our progress.\n\n---\n\n33 Target does not accept products containing Turkmen cotton or cotton originating from the Xinjiang province of China, regardless of where they were produced.\n34 2020 was a goal year for these two brands and while much was accomplished, the goal of 100% was not realized. However, pursuit of this goal did not end with the passing of the goal date. As of the end of 2021, the composite of these two brands has reached 92%.\n35 Owned brand food, household cleaning, personal care, baby care, beauty, cosmetics and candle products.\nResponsibly sourced commodities\n\nTo remain transparent about forest protection measures throughout our supply chain and owned brand product and packaging sourcing activities, we submit annual CDP Climate, Water and Forest Responses.\n\nRead more about responsibly sourcing commodities, environmental protection and social standards in our supply chain, and our work to never knowingly purchase \u2014 or sell \u2014 products containing minerals linked to armed conflict.\n\nRead about how we support our business partner performance, including the launch of our new proprietary self-assessment program to help business partners evaluate their management systems.\n\nMaterials\n\n| Metric | FY2021 | FY2020 | FY2019 | Framework |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Food & Beverage | | | | |\n| Identity Preserved | 18% | 1% | 0% | |\n| Segregated | 1% | 16% | 1% | |\n| Mass Balance | 78% | 79% | 50% | |\n| Book & Claim | 3% | 4% | 49% | |\n| Essentials & Beauty | | | | |\n| Identity Preserved | 0% | 0% | 0% | |\n| Segregated | 0% | 1% | 0% | |\n| Mass Balance | 94% | 87% | 40% | |\n| Book & Claim | 6% | 12% | 60% | |\n| Candles | | | | |\n| Identity Preserved | 0% | 0% | 0% | |\n| Segregated | 0% | 0% | 0% | |\n| Mass Balance | 53% | 70% | 28% | |\n| Book & Claim | 47% | 30% | 72% | |\n| Wood/Pulp | | | | |\n| Percentage of owned brand paper-based packaging sourced from sustainably managed forests | 86% | 63% | 51% | CG-AA-440a.4 |\n| Percentage of SKUs that conform to Target\u2019s forest product policy in: | | | | |\n| Spritz | 99% | 99% | 99% | |\n| Up&Up, Pillowfort and Cat & Jack | 92% | 64% | 38% | |\n| Threshold and Smith & Hawken | 31% | 24% | 0% | |\n| Percentage of rayon meeting CanopyStyle pledge | 100% | 100% | N/A | |\n\n36 In the candles category, our largest vendor used Book & Claim credits this year due to challenges sourcing physically certified supply. However, they are on track to be fully transitioned to physically certified sources of palm oil by the end of 2022 in keeping with Target\u2019s commitment.\n\n37 We utilize credible, independent third-party certifications to source forest products sustainably.\n\n38 Stock keeping unit.\nBiodiversity is a critical component of Earth\u2019s broader ecosystem, as it aids in Earth\u2019s ability to regulate climate, provide food and medicine, and promote cultural significance in local communities.\n\nThe Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures defines four \u201crealms\u201d of biodiversity: land, ocean, freshwater and atmosphere. This designation of biodiversity demonstrates that this topic encompasses all of our environmental and social initiatives.\n\nProtecting natural resources\n\nWith our overarching goal to become both equitable and regenerative through our Target Forward strategy, we recognize our dependencies on natural resources to serve our guests, in both our general assortment and food product categories.\n\nOur current efforts to nurture and protect the four realms of biodiversity include promoting regenerative agriculture, becoming signatories of bio-economy initiatives, and managing water with features like green roofs and rain gardens where possible.\n\nIn support of our ambition to leverage soil health practices to improve at least one million acres of land by 2025, we are partnering with several suppliers on initiatives that promote regenerative agriculture.\n\nWe are taking action to reduce the amount of water we use and to protect freshwater quality, quantity and access. To help preserve ocean habitats, we have sponsored research into microplastics, and work with suppliers that are green- or yellow-rated by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch program.\n\nCommitments and targets\n\nWe have set commitments for responsibly sourcing raw materials to help preserve forests and the species that rely on them, and improve local communities and their livelihoods. Both our Forest Products Policy and Palm Oil Commitment explicitly exclude conversion of High Conservation Value or High Carbon Stock forest areas.\n\nIn alignment with Target Forward, we are continuing conversations around our leading raw materials, building upon strong foundations to create biodiversity-specific commitments and targets using ongoing evidence-based strategies. We are currently undertaking benchmarking, learning and capacity building to develop a robust biodiversity commitment in line with our goals and key initiatives.\n\nPartnerships, initiatives and policies\n\nWe are committed to relevant biodiversity partnerships, initiatives and disclosures. As we continue to build out further partnerships, we want to recognize our current collaborations that are closely related to biodiversity (see below).\n\n| Partner | Program |\n|---------|---------|\n| Arvind | Funding a program with our apparel supplier to help 500 cotton farmers in India adopt organic and regenerative farming practices over the next five years. |\n| BCI Farmers | Helping train farmers to use water efficiently, reduce their use of harmful chemicals and commit to respecting worker rights and well-being. |\n| Cotton LEADS | Purchasing LEADS-certified products, which address environmental impacts on land and soil, biodiversity and carbon footprint, and accountability throughout the supply chain. |\n| Earthworm Foundation | Partnering on our palm oil sustainability work, including our aspiration of traceability to the mill level in our palm oil supply chain. |\n| Field to Market: The Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture | Supporting continuous improvement in U.S. commodity agriculture as an Associate Member and a partner on a Continuous Improvement Accelerator Project. |\n| FishWise | Partnering to monitor and continually improve the environmental sustainability, traceability and social impacts of farmed and wild-caught seafood. |\n| GreenBlue and its Sustainable Packaging Coalition | Developing a guide to verify responsible sourcing. |\n| The Nature Conservancy | Working as an implementation partner on initiatives to improve soil health and water stewardship. |\n| Sustainable Packaging Coalition and the American Forest Foundation | Helping develop the Forests in Focus platform to engage with forest owners and identify risks in forest product supply chains. |\n| U.S. Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (USRSB) | Representing the retail sector on the Board of the USRSB and helping develop goals, announced in April 2022, to make the U.S. beef industry more sustainable. |\nWater use and management\n\nWe\u2019re finding new ways to manage water sustainably, putting the needs of people, communities and the planet at the heart of how we work to deliver on our Target Forward strategy.\n\nWater is essential to our agricultural materials for food, textile products and manufacturing, and in the operation of every Target facility. Access to clean water is also a fundamental need for guests and communities all along our value chain, and we are committed to help build water resiliency in the areas where we operate so this need can always be met.\n\nIdentifying and managing water risks\n\nWhen developing our management strategy, we first identify water-related risks\\(^{40}\\) that may have a financial or strategic impact on our business and/or communities where we operate.\n\nWe focus on addressing high-priority areas, products and processes to safeguard freshwater quality, quantity and access. In the U.S., this is particularly important along the West Coast \u2014 where water scarcity\\(^{41}\\) is a significant issue \u2014 and in the Northeast where our greatest impacts relate to water quality. Since 2018, we have been guided by our freshwater stewardship approach.\n\nAnnually, we use the WRI\u2019s Aqueduct tool to understand water risk for both domestic and international facilities. One key finding from our latest assessment was that quantity and quality are issues we should continue to monitor and work to mitigate through increasingly robust measures.\n\nIn domestic locations, we are using the insights from this assessment to inform our latest water goals and to accelerate efforts in the highest-risk watersheds, identifying priority areas of impact based on withdrawals in water-stressed\\(^{42}\\) areas. This will help us focus efforts at facilities where there\u2019s current and/or future potential for higher water risk.\n\nIn our manufacturing supply chain, this information is incorporated into a hotspot mapping exercise, alongside Higg FEM data. This helps us assess their environmental footprint and prioritize which supply chain locations to focus on for programs like Apparel Impact Institute (Aii)\u2019s Clean by Design.\n\nAdvancing Target Forward through water security\n\nSecuring water resources is a key consideration across both our sustainable brands and waste elimination pillars. Only by conserving water sources can we deliver sustainably sourced materials and operations that protect, sustain and restore nature.\n\nWe draw on key partnerships to direct efforts and reduce our impact, with a strategic focus on:\n\n- Food and fiber in our raw material supply chain.\n- Textile and apparel factories in priority watersheds in our manufacturing supply chain.\n- Water risk reduction and stormwater management in direct operations, supporting resilience and collective water security\\(^{43}\\) in the communities we serve.\n\nIn identifying water risks and water-stressed regions where we operate, we will begin to set new value chain goals that reflect the context of our water stewardship approach, as well as our understanding of setting targets around the nexus between climate, water and biodiversity.\n\nWater use in our operations\n\nWhile we work on developing new science-based contextual water goals in connection with Target Forward, we continue to operate under the principles originally outlined in our Freshwater Stewardship Approach to guide our ongoing work.\n\nDirect operations\n\nAcross our stores, supply chain facilities and headquarters locations, we\u2019re acting to reduce water scarcity and improve water quality outcomes.\n\nTarget is recognized for maintaining best practices in managing stormwater and the quality of water leaving our sites. Many of our facilities have stormwater management systems in place, and we partner with local organizations to improve infrastructure and benefit local watersheds.\n\nWe are also refining our salt application practices to reduce the amount of chloride entering local water bodies. Target has many sites where salt is used to maintain safety during adverse weather conditions for guests and team members during the winter. To address any impacts the salt may have on local lakes and rivers, we refreshed our training at our stores, supply chain facilities and other sites that experience snow events. The training, which includes application techniques and disposal methods, is based on smart salting techniques developed by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. We will continue to evolve our approach as new practices, techniques and equipment are developed.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{40}\\) Water risk refers to the possibility of an entity experiencing a water-related challenge (e.g., water scarcity, water stress, flooding, infrastructure decay, drought).

Source: IPCC WGI Sixth Assessment Report\nTarget closely monitors water use across our operations to quickly identify properties that may have possible leaks or need plumbing repairs. At many locations where landscapes are irrigated, we use HydroPoint smart controllers to water plants only when necessary, find underground leaks when they occur, and to pause irrigation when it\u2019s raining or rainfall has been sufficient.\n\nWe are now exploring new goals that align with our stewardship approach. As we develop the next phase of our strategy, water stress and other water risks will be incorporated to determine priority projects and areas.\n\n**Products**\n\nWe are taking steps to reduce the impact of our product portfolio and production techniques on vulnerable water resources.\n\nTarget is an associate member of The Microfibre Consortium, which facilitates development of practical solutions to minimize fiber fragmentation and environmental releases from textile manufacturing and the product life cycle. We have also supported OceanWise microplastics research by funding a cohort through the Outdoor Industry Association.\n\nRead more about our approach to water management.\n\n**Supply chain programs and partnerships**\n\nWe maintain several initiatives and partnerships to enhance supply chain water use efficiency and stewardship.\n\n- In 2021, an estimated 20.9 billion gallons of water were saved thanks to our sourcing of Better Cotton.\n- In addition to climate benefits, our regenerative agriculture work aims to protect local water sources by reducing agricultural run-off.\n- Our work with the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) organization sets higher standards for factory wastewater discharge and reduces the presence of harmful chemicals in the manufacturing process for owned brand textiles.\n- Ongoing programs with Aii are improving water efficiency in home and apparel textiles.\n\n**Beyond the fence line**\n\nWe strive to not only make a difference in water efficiency and stewardship of our direct and indirect operations, but to move beyond our own fence line to positively impact and give back to the communities where we extract from their water sources. As we evolve our beyond the fence line goals, we have made a concerted effort to make changes today.\n\nWe support communities\u2019 access to water and sanitation through Water.org. As of 2021, this partnership has resulted in more than 1.3 million people (88% of whom are female) being reached with lasting, reliable, household water and sanitation solutions.\n\nBeyond our direct operations fence line, we are hard at work understanding and participating in community water projects across California, which is one of our greatest markets and also one of our greatest water-stressed areas of our operations.\n\n**Water use**\n\n| Metric | FY2021 | FY2020 | FY2019 | Framework |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| **Manufacturing** | | | | |\n| Percentage of SKUs of garment-washed owned brand apparel utilizing water-saving design principles | 57% | 74% | 49% | SASB CG-AA-430a.1 |\n| Denim | 84% | 95% | 61% | |\n| Non-denim | 40% | 53% | 42% | |\n| **Direct operations** | | | | |\n| Total water withdrawn (ML) | 11,399 | 10,571 | 10,986 | SASB CG-HP-140a.1(1) |\n| Percentage from municipal water utilities | >99% | >99% | >99% | SASB CG-HP-140a.1(2) |\n| Percentage from water-stressed areas | 37.4% | 37.6% | N/A | |\n| Percentage change in water withdrawal since 2010 | -11.3% | -17.7% | -14.5% | |\n\n**Metric**\n\n- **FY2021**: 2021 financial year\n- **FY2020**: 2020 financial year\n- **FY2019**: 2019 financial year\n- **SASB**: Sustainability Accounting Standards Board\n- **CG-HP-140a.1(1)**: GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) Sustainability Accounting Standards Board\n- **CG-HP-140a.1(2)**: GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) Sustainability Accounting Standards Board\n\n**BCI** supports farmers in water efficiency to consume and pollute less water, thus achieving greater yields and building resilience to climate change while promoting the fair use and allocation of water resources among users beyond the farm, up to the watershed level.\nConsumers are increasingly interested in the chemicals used in their products. Our guests trust us to deliver products that are better for them, their families, their communities and the environment.\n\nWith responsible chemical management forming an integral part of our Target Forward ambition to design and elevate sustainable brands, we are committed to advancing transparency, progressive chemical management and green chemistry innovation across our value chain.\n\nIn 2017, we launched our comprehensive Chemicals Policy. The policy encompasses owned and national brand products we sell, as well as products used in our operations, such as cleaning supplies in stores. Supplemental Chemical Policy training for owned brand team members began in 2022.\n\nWe have set goals to remove two categories of chemicals from owned brands and national brand exclusive textile products by the end of 2022:\n\n- Improve textile products by removing perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs), which are typically found in stain- and water-resistant coatings.\n- Improve textile products by removing added flame retardants that are potential carcinogens or pose harm to guests, workers or communities.\n\nRead more about our approach and progress on this goal.\n\nKnowing PFCs exist in other products beyond textiles, we launched a new goal that expands this to all owned brand categories. By 2025, we aim to remove intentionally added perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) from owned brand products, including textiles, cosmetics, beauty and cookware items. We also plan for all our owned brand apparel textile facilities to comply with the ZDHC Progressive-level wastewater standard by 2025.\n\nRead about how we manage potential risks and hazards associated with chemicals using our policy to guide actions.\n\n**Chemical use, management and innovation**\n\n**Textiles**\n\nWithin textiles, we have focused on our owned brand supply chain as we drive for sustainable brands and a circular future.\n\nFor products, this is done through our Restricted Substances List (RSL), which applies to any owned brand product made with textiles (including apparel and non-apparel) and restricts the use of chemicals that are carcinogenic or that can cause reproductive issues from human contact. Compliance with our RSL is validated using a risk-based testing approach. In 2021, we had a compliance rate of 99%.\n\nFor manufacturing, we joined ZDHC in 2018 and adopted its Manufacturing Restricted Substances List (MRSL), prohibiting the use of certain chemicals in the production of our owned brand products containing textiles. Having implemented the MRSL across apparel/clothing categories, we are starting to roll it out to accessories (non-clothing) vendors. We also held formal MRSL training for our team members in July and August 2021.\n\n**Formulated essentials**\n\nWhen we launched our Chemicals Policy, we established our first Unwanted Chemicals List (UCL) to address ingredients of concern in household cleaning and personal care products. Over the years, we have gained greater visibility and understanding of the chemicals in our formulated products. We have applied our learnings to evolve our approach for these product categories.\n\nAs a result of our analysis, we updated the UCL and renamed it our Target Priority Chemical List (TPCL) in October 2021. We are also calculating our aggregate use of chemicals via the Chemical Footprint Project, of which we are a signatory and survey participant.\n\n**Innovations in green chemistry**\n\nWe are investing in innovative new green chemistry ideas and sharing our chemicals list and guidance publicly. We exceeded our goal to invest $5 million in green chemistry innovation by 2022, having spent over $5 million by the end of 2020.\n\nWe also participate in multiple industrywide collaborations. As a member of the Green Chemistry & Commerce Council and Retailer Leadership Council, we discuss implementation tactics with other retailers to drive transparency around the chemicals used in consumer products.\n\n**Target in action**\n\n**Target Clean**\n\nWe are also prioritizing and expanding programs like Target Clean, which incentivizes national brands and merchants to avoid using chemicals of concern. The Target Clean symbol, found in stores and online, also helps our guests easily identify more than 10,000 products formulated without specific ingredients.\nSocial Overview\nInside Social\nSupporting Our Team Members\nBoard and Workplace Diversity\nProducts and Guest Experiences Built on Fairness and Equity\nServing and Strengthening Communities\nPeople at the heart\n\nIn everything we do, people are our priority. The success of our business depends on the vitality and resilience of our team members and guests, supply chain partners and communities we serve. By working to identify and resolve the inequities that create limits in our people-centric business, as well as celebrating and building on what makes our communities special, we further our purpose: to help all families discover the joy of everyday life.\n\nOur work contributes to the following SDGs:\n\nFrameworks reported on:\n\nGRI  SASB  UNGPRF\n\nNumber of team members\n\n450,000\n\nFY2020: 409,000\nFY2019: 368,000\n\nNew starting hourly wage range (2022)\n\n$15\u2013$24\n\nFY2020: $15\nFY2019: $13\n\nPay equity (U.S.)\n\n100% gender pay equity (adjusted)\n100% race/color pay equity (adjusted)\n\nSpend with diverse suppliers (USD)\n\n$3,266 million\n\nFY2020: $2,235 million\nFY2019: $2,942 million\n\nWorkforce composition by race/color (U.S. workforce)\n\nDiversity at Target\n\nWorkforce composition by gender (global)\n\nNon-managers\n\nFemale 56%\nMale 44%\n\nManagers\n\nFemale 57%\nMale 43%\n\nNon-managers\n\nWhite 46%\nBlack/African American 16%\nHispanic/Latino 28%\nAsian 5%\nNative Hawaiian/Pacific Islander <1%\nAmerican Indian/Alaska Native <1%\nTwo or more races 3%\n\nManagers\n\nWhite 56%\nBlack/African American 13%\nHispanic/Latino 23%\nAsian 4%\nNative Hawaiian/Pacific Islander <1%\nAmerican Indian/Alaska Native <1%\nTwo or more races 3%\n\nApproximate number of full-time, part-time and seasonal team members employed as of January 29, 2022.\n\nSuppliers that are at least 51% owned, controlled and operated by women; Black, Indigenous and people of color; LGBTQIA+; veterans or persons with disabilities.\nInside Social\n\nSupporting Our Team Members\nWe foster a culture in which we care for each other, invest in the growth of our people and win together as a team.\n\nCaring for our people helps us attract, retain and develop a diverse workforce, and create equitable and inclusive workplaces that accelerate opportunity. We offer our team members a robust pay and benefits package, as well as opportunities to grow professionally by providing a compelling work environment and abundant learning and career development opportunities. These enhance our position as one of the largest employers in the U.S., and contribute to our reputation for providing a workplace experience for our business to succeed and every team member has the opportunity to fulfill their potential.\n\nBoard and Workplace Diversity\nWe champion workplace diversity and an inclusive work environment with a focus on attracting, engaging, developing and advancing diverse talent.\n\nTo deliver better results, we need to create welcoming work environments and continue to be a leader in diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging. Our teams must invite a variety of voices, experiences and viewpoints, and be safe places where team members feel included and supported to do their best work. Fostering diverse teams helps us mirror the communities we serve and offer inclusive products and experiences that make Target a destination for our guests.\n\nProducts and Guest Experiences Built on Fairness and Equity\nWe want Target guests to feel valued, regardless of age, gender, race, culture, physical abilities or sensitivities, shape or size.\n\nWe\u2019re committed to an inclusive assortment for all with our owned, rational, exclusive and emerging sustainable brands that are affordable and inspirational. Our inclusive packaging design also provides an opportunity to address different dimensions of difference, feature bilingual and universal language, and allow for accessibility.\n\nServing and Strengthening Communities\nTarget locations are a source of prosperity through the employment we offer and our investment in local economic development.\n\nOur long-term success is interdependent with that of our local communities. That\u2019s why one of our key Target Forward commitments is to enable the vitality and resilience of our team members and the communities we serve. We start by listening to and learning from our community stakeholders. Then we respond strategically, leveraging our capabilities and resources to build capacity, accelerate access and opportunity, and co-create community-driven solutions that drive real impact.\nHuman capital management\n\nIn support of our Target Forward ambitions, to accelerate opportunity and equity, we aim to create an inclusive workforce and workplace, and to enable the vitality and resilience of our team. This requires a commitment to fair labor practices that work for and support our team members.\n\nHuman capital management matters are overseen by our Board of Directors through the Compensation & Human Capital Management Committee, and are tied into our Target Forward sustainability and equity framework.\n\nOur Target Forward goals include a desire to empower all team members to create the employment experience of their choice through personalized scheduling, flexibility and above-market pay. By 2025, we plan to invest in technology and modern processes to empower team members to create the employment experience of their choice through personalized scheduling and leading pay for each market we operate in.\n\n| Metric                                      | FY2021 | FY2020 | FY2019 | Framework |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Number of team members (as of fiscal year-end) | 450,000 | 409,000 | 368,000 | GRI 102-8 |\n| Percentage of active workforce under collective bargaining agreements | 0% | 0% | 0% | SASB FB-FR-310a.2 |\n\nApproximate number of full-time, part-time and seasonal team members employed as of January 29, 2022.\nCompensation and benefits\n\nTarget has played a leadership role in advancing equitable pay and benefits, coordinating with partners to remain at the forefront of our industry.\n\nWe believe that all team members should be paid equitably, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or other distinguishing characteristics. Our pay equity work is based on adjusted pay analyses, which measure whether team members are paid the same for doing the same or similar work.\n\nCompensation\n\nOur ongoing investments in our culture, competitive pay, meaningful work and opportunities for growth have been essential in supporting our thriving business and helping our team members build rewarding careers. Target announced in 2017 that we would raise starting wages to $15 per hour, an industry-leading milestone we achieved nearly two years ago. In 2022, we announced a new starting wage range of $15 to $24, depending on the job and the local market.\n\nIn 2021, we again measured whether team members were being paid the same for doing the same or similar work. Our adjusted pay equity analyses showed that, domestically, women were paid 100% of the pay for men, and BIPOC were paid 100% of the pay for white team members.\n\nWe also analyzed median pay. Our median pay analyses are unadjusted, meaning they do not take into account whether the team members being compared are in the same or similar role, location or are otherwise comparable. Those unadjusted analyses show that, globally, women are paid 100% of the median pay for male team members and, domestically, BIPOC are paid 100% of the median pay for white team members.\n\nTo maintain equity, we train recruiters and managers, and provide tools to reduce the risk of bias in decisions about starting salaries and annual pay increases. We also prohibit questions about prior salary in most hiring situations, annual pay increases. We also prohibit questions of bias in decisions about starting salaries and annual pay increases. We also prohibit questions about prior salary in most hiring situations, inform each team member of their pay range and regularly conduct pay audits.\n\nEmployee well-being\n\nWe offer our team members competitive benefits packages, whether they are in part-time, full-time or salaried positions. By 2023, Target aims to eliminate complexity and barriers to entry, by offering easily accessible benefits and resources to all team members. These will focus on learning and career advancement, physical and mental health, family support and financial well-being.\n\nAnd by 2025, we plan to increase access to quality, affordable healthcare for all team members and their families.\n\nPhysical health\n\nIn early 2022, we extended the availability of our medical plan to hourly store and distribution center team members who work a minimum average of 25 hours a week (down from 30 hours per week) and reduced the waiting period to become benefits eligible.\n\nWe provide access to 24/7 virtual healthcare visits for all U.S.-based team members via the CirrusMD app, and all team members can access Grokker, a free fitness and well-being platform. Team members receive an additional 20% wellness discount on fitness and wellness products at Target \u2014 such as fruits and vegetables, athletic apparel and tobacco-cessation products. A concierge service for team members enrolled in our nationwide medical plan explains care paths and treatment options, and provides links to support programs.\n\nWe offer all team members access to a free well-being platform, supporting their physical and mental health with fitness, nutrition, meditation courses and more.\n\n| Metric | FY2021 | FY2020 | FY2019 | Framework |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Starting hourly wage (USD) | $15.00 | $15.00 | $13.00 | SASB CG-MR-310a.1 |\n| Average hourly wage of store and supply chain facility team members (not including overtime) (USD) | $16.97 | $16.06 | $14.48 |\n| Percentage of store and supply chain facility team members earning locally applicable minimum wage | 2.2% | 5.6% | 13.9% |\nCompensation and benefits\n\nTarget in action\n\nDebt-free education assistance\n\nRecognizing that financing can be a significant barrier to further education, in September 2021, we launched Dream to Be, a debt-free education assistance program for our U.S.-based part-time and full-time team members through education platform Guild. Created to further the impact of our Target Forward equity ambition, the program will enable team members to pursue undergraduate and associate degrees, certificates and bootcamp programs free of charge. Within the first year of the benefit, the debt-free offering will include more than 250 business-aligned programs from more than 40 schools, colleges and universities. Target will also cover other expenses such as textbooks and course fees.\n\nOver the next four years, we will invest $200 million in helping eliminate student debt for team members who engage in the Dream to Be benefit.\n\nFinancial security\n\nWe offer DailyPay, a pay advance app that allows team members to request their earned but unpaid wages instantly or next day, while also providing tools to help with budgeting and savings. We continue to offer credit union membership, a 401(k) plan with matching contributions of up to 5% of eligible earnings, a 10% discount on merchandise, with an additional 20% discount on wellness items (on top of 5% for using a REDCard), and access to the Team Member Giving Fund.\n\nThroughout 2021, we recognized the outstanding efforts of our team, who served our guests and kept our stores open during a difficult time, with more than $75 million in bonuses. The most recent of these was a $200 recognition bonus in July 2021, given to all frontline hourly team members in stores, supply chain facilities and U.S.-based headquarters hourly team members.\n\nFamily\n\nOur paid family leave policy provides four weeks of paid, job-protected leave for eligible part-time, full-time and salaried team members. We reimburse team members up to $10,000 for adoption (per child) or surrogacy fees (per attempt). Our backup care benefit includes an industry-leading 20 days per dependent of in-center childcare or in-home child or elder care, and our response to COVID-19 has included expanding eligibility to all U.S. team members.\n\nTeam member experience\n\nOur multi-channel listening program enables Target to gain additional insight into our team member experience, what\u2019s driving the team\u2019s engagement and how our team is experiencing our culture. More specifically, this program includes an annual census survey (Team Voice Annual), an \u201calways on\u201d weekly survey, topical surveys to better understand key priorities (e.g., our hybrid working environment at headquarters) and experience measurement surveys to better understand the team member journey. Coupled with our Great Place to Work partnership, we put our Target team at the center as our most important asset.\n\nBenefits\n\n| Metric | FY2021 | FY2020 | FY2019 | Framework |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Number of team members eligible for a 401(k) | 270,453 | 258,983 | 228,375 | SASB 401-2 |\n| Number of team members participating in our 401(k) plan | 129,458 | 122,903 | 115,384 | |\n| Number of team members receiving full employer match in a 401(k) | 117,034 | 103,000 | 88,234 | |\n| Average team member percentage contribution to 401(k)s (for those who contribute, not including the 5% company match) | 7.5% | 6.1% | 5.9% | |\n| Number of team members receiving tuition reimbursement | 2,142 | 1,783 | 1,823 | |\n| Number of team members enrolled in debt-free education assistance | 2,611 | N/A | N/A | |\n| Number of people using Team Member Life Resources (TMLR) | 29,833 | N/A | N/A | |\n| Number of people using TMLR and Onsite Life Resources | N/A | 111,583 | 108,986 | |\n| Number of team members enrolled in Target Credit Union | 20,111 | 20,328 | 19,616 | |\n| Amount saved by team members using our wellness discount (USD) | $11.3 million | $11.5 million | $10.6 million | |\n\nTeam member experience\n\n| Metric | FY2021 | FY2020 | FY2019 | Framework |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Total Target Team engagement score | 77% | N/A | 76% | SASB CG-EC-330a.1 |\nWorkplace health and safety\n\nWe strive to maintain a safe, healthy and secure working environment.\n\nWe want our team members to follow laws, safety procedures and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards, as well as be advocates for the safety of all team members.\n\nOur work is guided by our Safety Policy, which sets out high-level guidance on our safety requirements, as well as our Team Member Illness Policy and Disability Accommodation Policy.\n\nSafety and training\n\nOur goal is to prevent guest and team member incidents, injuries and illnesses, and to comply with all relevant safety and health standards.\n\nIn both stores and our global logistics operations, we continue to prioritize safety in support of our commitment to being \u201cthe safest place to work and shop.\u201d We expect team members to follow our health and safety programs and procedures closely, continuing to invest in our safety team. In 2022, we will have a dedicated Safety Manager in each supply chain facility.\n\nWe require the use of PPE where applicable and the immediate reporting of incidents and near misses. We also encourage and empower team members to stop any unsafe action or condition that presents an imminent danger or risk, and assess and address that risk before resuming work.\n\nIn addition, we have made substantial improvements and investments \u2014 for example, by establishing a risk assessment process to better align equipment and procedures with safety requirements.\n\nTarget in action\n\nOur response to COVID-19\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we reinforced our well-established risk processes by setting up a Leadership Task Force. As part of our executive leadership team, this six-member group (including our CEO) oversees the way we handle crises, including scenario planning.\n\nTeam member health and safety\n\nThe health, safety and well-being of our team has always been a top priority, and this continues to be even more true as we manage the ongoing impact of COVID-19. Throughout the pandemic, we have focused on helping healthy team members get to work while taking care of those who were ill and unable to work.\n\nWe responded quickly by rolling out health, well-being and safety programs. In addition to implementing enhanced cleaning routines and social distancing protocols, we:\n\n- Waived our absenteeism policy.\n- Provided free backup care for both children and adults when regular access to care was unreliable.\n- Offered paid leave for quarantine and confirmed illness, and for vulnerable team members.\n- Made personal protective equipment (PPE), thermometers and at-home health checks available to all team members.\n- Provided access to free 24/7 virtual healthcare visits for all U.S.-based team members via the CirrusMD app, and continued to offer mental health counseling for all team members via Team Member Life Resources.\n\nAs vaccination programs were rolled out, we removed barriers to access by providing discounted Lyft rides to and from appointments where needed, and up to six hours paid time off for hourly team members to receive vaccines. We also currently offer paid time off for anyone suffering an adverse reaction after their vaccine.\n\nIndustry support\n\nAs an essential business, we have continued to operate across all states since the COVID-19 pandemic started. To support other businesses as they reopened, we developed the SAFE Retail toolkit. Available to any business adapting to new operating circumstances, the toolkit details the processes and tools Target adopted to sustain operations, while prioritizing the health and safety of our guests, team members and communities.\n\nIn addition to presenting our learnings to small businesses via various webinars, we have shared the SAFE Retail toolkit with governors\u2019 offices, business organizations and local- and county-level officials across the country, and made the full toolkit freely available online.\n\nCommunity response\n\nOver the past couple of years, Target and the Target Foundation have provided flexible and responsive funding to help community partners adapt to the changing landscape brought on by COVID-19. More than $10 million was invested to support community safety and recovery efforts.\n\nIn 2021, we made a $5 million incremental commitment to community-based NGOs working to advance vaccine equity among diverse populations.\n\nLearn more about our COVID-19 response on our website.\nTalent and development\n\nThrough personalized, curated, immersive and experience-based training, we help team members gain the skills and experiences they need to fulfill their career ambitions, while delivering sustainable growth, driving our culture and achieving our company purpose.\n\nCareer development resources\nWe tailor our career development resources for different stages of the career journey at Target.\n\nAvailable to all\n- A consistent approach to assessing, reviewing and rewarding talent through performance and career development conversations.\n- Experience-based learning through stretch assignments.\n- An internal careers site to help team members navigate their careers at Target.\n- On-demand, curated learning resources delivered via Workday Learning and the Skillssoft learning catalog.\n- Access to industry research, trade publications and magazines via EBSCO.\n\nAvailable to specific audiences\n- An internal talent marketplace for short-term assignments where team members can apply their expertise and learn new skills.\n- Debt-free, capped and tuition reimbursement programs for job-related courses at accredited tech schools, colleges and/or universities, as well as costs associated with Graduate Equivalency Degree (GED) leadership and executive development programs and other resources for leaders.\n- Experience-based learning through short-term assignments, pro bono opportunities, business councils, leadership labs and volunteer events.\n\nLeadership training\nWith the unprecedented challenges we have faced over the last two years, our leadership training has focused on building resilience, empathy, inclusion and agility. We quickly developed online learning content, resources and tools to equip senior leaders to drive business growth while acknowledging and supporting their teams through unique circumstances.\n\n- Our talent development team launched an Adaptive Leadership self-service website, containing curated content designed to help leaders navigate volatile and challenging environments.\n\nLearning and development\n\n| Metric | FY2021 | FY2020 | FY2019 | Framework |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Percentage of team members receiving training during the fiscal year | | | | |\n| Excluding onboarding and compliance | 90% | 98% | 65% | 404-2 |\n| Including onboarding and compliance | >99% | 99% | 97% | 404-2 |\n| Select training programs (hours) | | | | |\n| Onboarding (Target Welcome) | 9,570,598 | 6,789,932 | 1,688,352 | 404-2 |\n| Diversity, equity and inclusion | 253,264 | 67,500 | 350,426 | |\n| Leadership development | 56,257 | 27,332 | 74,148 | |\n| Annual performance reviews | | | | |\n| Percentage of eligible team members receiving reviews | 100% | 100% | 100% | 404-3 |\n| Number of team members receiving reviews | 351,400 | 301,000 | 316,000 | |\n\nAll team members are eligible for performance reviews except those on leave of absence for more than 305 days, those hired in Q4 and interns.\nWe embrace diversity, strive to offer everyone equitable opportunities and celebrate our team members\u2019 differences.\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) isn\u2019t just the responsibility of a single team at Target. Inclusivity is a core value for a reason. We all play a role in making our environment one where all can thrive and belong.\n\nHaving clear DE&I goals and targets helps us measure and accelerate our efforts. In 2021, we continued to make progress against our 2019\u20132021 goals, supported by our diversity action committees and employee resource groups. For example, we increased the promotion of women, including women of color, to senior leadership levels. To accelerate our progress and reinforce our commitment, we announced a new set of 2022\u20132024 DE&I goals in February 2022.\n\nOur Board of Directors has a long history of gender and racial/ethnic diversity. As of January 29, 2022, 38% of Board members were female, while 31% were racially or ethnically diverse.\n\nDE&I strategy\nFor over 16 years, our DE&I strategy has guided efforts in four areas:\n\n- Creating an inclusive work environment.\n- Delivering an inclusive guest experience.\n- Advancing workforce diversity.\n- Leveraging our influence to drive positive impact on society.\n\nToday, DE&I is integrated throughout the business, guided by a process of continuously listening to \u2014 and learning from \u2014 stakeholders and collaborating with leading DE&I groups.\n\nA dedicated DE&I team leverages our dimensions of difference as one of Target\u2019s greatest strengths, while diversity action committees embed our commitment in each business unit.\n\nNon-discrimination\nWe respect cultural and individual differences and do not tolerate discrimination based on protected status or personal characteristics, including but not limited to:\n\n- Race, national origin or ancestry.\n- Color.\n- Sex (including pregnancy, childbirth and lactation status).\n- Gender, gender identity or gender expression.\n- Religion or religious creed.\n- Age.\n- Medical condition or disability.\n- Sexual orientation.\n- Citizenship status.\n- Military or veteran status.\n- Genetic information or characteristics (or those of a family member).\n\nOur stance is detailed in our Employee Information Report EEO-1 and Harassment-Free Workplace Policy, as well as our Code of Ethics, while our DE&I strategy shapes how we put our position into action every day.\n\nWe monitor the representation of women and racially or ethnically diverse team members at different levels of the company, and disclose the composition of our team in our annual Workforce Diversity Report, which includes demographic information using the categories disclosed in our EEO-1 report.\n\nTarget in action\nHBCU Design Challenge\nTo foster inclusion and better serve our guests, Target teamed up with historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) for the inaugural HBCU Design Challenge in 2021. Students were invited to submit designs for potential inclusion in Target\u2019s Black History Month collection.\n\nAs well as having their designs featured in the 2022 collection, the three winners also had the opportunity to learn about different aspects of production, from textile selection to placing the new products in stores. Read more about our winners and their designs.\n\nThe Design Challenge is one of three HBCU competitions. Learn about the winners of our 2022 Technology and Future Leaders in Retail Challenges.\nWorkplace diversity\n\nIncreasing representation\n\nAs part of our Target Forward goals, Target aims to build a team that equitably reflects the communities we serve by 2030. We actively seek to recruit, retain and advance women and people of color, especially in leadership and technical roles where they are historically underrepresented. In particular, Target aims to increase representation of Black team members across the company by 20%. By 2023, Target aims to increase the promotional rate of people of color and women while reducing the rate of turnover.\n\nTo reach diverse talent pools, we have relationships with organizations including the African American Leadership Forum, the National Organization on Disability, the National Black MBA Association, Management Leadership for Tomorrow and others. We also work strategically with HBCUs to find meaningful ways to invest in students, such as our education assistance program, and actively recruit for roles at Target.\n\nWe also push for more diverse representation through inclusive capability-building opportunities:\n\n- **Target Elevate\u2019s 2021 virtual conference** featured breakfast sessions with 18 speakers, self-paced learning opportunities and masterclasses with live Q&As to help grow the number of women in technology.\n- **We participate in AnitaB.org\u2019s annual conference \u2014 the Grace Hopper Celebration** \u2014 to help more women in technical fields reach their full potential.\n\nWhile we still have more to do, we have increased representation for BIPOC in exempt roles by 30% and women of color in similar positions by 41% since 2019. By the end of 2021, we had achieved 56% female workforce representation and 45% female representation in senior leadership. In addition, there was a 16% increase in women promoted to senior leadership levels and a doubling of the promotion of women of color to senior leadership, while the promotion of people of color from the exempt entry level to midlevel rose by 62%.\n\n**DE&I training**\n\nTo encourage our team members and leaders to consider all dimensions of difference and identities, we have continued to offer unconscious bias training in addition to anti-racism training. We also offer a year-long training series for HR business partners that promotes racial equity.\n\nOur Disabilities Awareness training focuses specifically on working with team members with disabilities, while a comprehensive disability toolkit assists HR partners and leaders in ensuring those with disabilities feel supported and included. Our internal Disability Accommodation Policy, last updated in early 2022, includes our commitments to inclusion and examples of the types of accommodations we provide.\n\nTo enhance internal efforts, we collaborate with the National Organization on Disability and use its Disability Employment Tracker to benchmark our practices and policies.\n\n---\n\n**Target in action**\n\n**Advancing DE&I together**\n\nIn July 2021, we hosted the first \u201cGrowing the Circle: Championing a Diverse, Equitable & Inclusive Society, Together\u201d forum.\n\nDuring the event, 1,500 Target leaders and external partners discussed how we can collaborate to deliver on our four DE&I focus areas. Cross-industry experts joined Target leaders in exploring how to scale up impact through shared accountability, data transparency and business resources.\n\nContent developed for the forum was shared on a dedicated DE&I Forum webpage to help other organizations accelerate their own DE&I journey.\n\nAdditionally, in February 2021, we expanded our Ability Awareness Network to become the Disability & Mental Health Business Council. The cross-functional team fosters an inclusive culture around disability, mental health and neurodiversity through advocacy and education.\n\nFurthermore, Target held the first inaugural Twin Cities Asian Executive Leadership conference, which focused on investing in the development and community building of Asian talent, and we also established the Native American and Indigenous Network within our ERG community. This new group will focus on amplifying the voices and experience of our Native American and Indigenous team members.\nTarget in action\n\nRacial Equity Action and Change (REACH)\n\nWe have long worked to create an inclusive guest experience and work environment, by advancing workforce diversity, making our stores places of safety and inclusivity, and driving positive change in the communities we serve. But in 2020, when our hometown of Minneapolis was at the center of the racial justice protests that shook the United States and the world, we felt we had to elevate our approach further.\n\nThat summer, we established the Racial Equity Action and Change (REACH) committee. Composed of six senior leaders from across our company, the committee was formed to advance racial equity and create more equitable experiences for Black team members and guests across our business and the communities we serve.\n\nThe committee guided our REACH strategy, through which we committed to increase the representation of Black team members across the company by 20% by 2023, with a focus on advancement, retention and hiring in specific roles where we know we still have work to do. We have also pledged to invest $100 million through 2025 to fuel economic prosperity in Black communities across the country, and committed to spend more than $2 billion with Black-owned businesses by the end of 2025.\n\nREACH activities are focused across four pillars:\n\n- **Team**: Building an inclusive work environment for Black team members.\n- **Guests**: Creating an inclusive guest environment for Black Americans.\n- **Communities**: Supporting Black communities.\n- **Public Policy & Civic Engagement**: Convening partners to impact civic discussions.\n\nOur REACH strategy and goals were reinforced in 2021 as one aspect of our DE&I commitments, as well as being a key component in realizing our Target Forward vision to co-create an equitable and regenerative future.\n\nRead more about workplace diversity and the progress we are making across our areas of focus.\n## Workplace diversity\n\n### Diversity, equity and inclusion\n\n| Metric | FY2021 | FY2020 | FY2019 | Framework |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| **Percentage of women in our global workforce** | | | | |\n| Total workforce | 56% | 58% | 58% | CG-MR-330a.1 |\n| Managers | 57% | 56% | 53% | GRI 405-1 |\n| Non-managers | 56% | 58% | 59% | |\n| Officers | 44% | 41% | 40% | |\n| Leadership team | 46% | 50% | 42% | |\n| Board of Directors | 38% | 31% | 31% | |\n| **Percentage of people of color in our U.S. workforce** | | | | |\n| U.S. workforce | 53% | 50% | 49% | CG-MR-330a.1 |\n| Managers | 43% | 40% | 39% | GRI 405-1 |\n| Non-managers | 54% | 51% | 51% | |\n| Officers | 33% | 31% | 28% | |\n| Leadership team | 23% | 25% | 25% | |\n| Board of Directors | 31% | 46% | 46% | |\n| **Percentage American Indian/Alaska Native in our U.S. workforce** | | | | |\n| U.S. workforce | <1% | <1% | <1% | CG-MR-330a.1 |\n| Managers | <1% | <1% | <1% | GRI 405-1 |\n| Non-managers | <1% | <1% | <1% | |\n| Officers | 0% | 0% | 0% | |\n| Leadership team | 0% | 0% | 0% | |\n| Board of Directors | 0% | 0% | 0% | |\n| **Percentage Asian in our U.S. workforce** | | | | |\n| U.S. workforce | 5% | 5% | 5% | CG-MR-330a.1 |\n| Managers | 4% | 4% | 4% | GRI 405-1 |\n| Non-managers | 5% | 5% | 5% | |\n| Officers | 10% | 10% | 10% | |\n| Leadership team | 8% | 8% | 8% | |\n| Board of Directors | 0% | 0% | 0% | |\n| **Percentage Black/African American in our U.S. workforce** | | | | |\n| U.S. workforce | 16% | 15% | 15% | CG-MR-330a.1 |\n| Managers | 13% | 12% | 12% | GRI 405-1 |\n| Non-managers | 16% | 15% | 16% | |\n| Officers | 10% | 9% | 5% | |\n| Leadership team | 8% | 8% | 8% | |\n| Board of Directors | 15% | 23% | 15% | |\n| **Percentage Hispanic/Latino in our U.S. workforce** | | | | |\n| U.S. workforce | 28% | 26% | 25% | CG-MR-330a.1 |\n| Managers | 23% | 21% | 20% | GRI 405-1 |\n| Non-managers | 28% | 27% | 25% | |\n| Officers | 10% | 10% | 11% | |\n| Leadership team | 8% | 8% | 8% | |\n| Board of Directors | 15% | 23% | 31% | |\n| **Percentage Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander in our U.S. workforce** | | | | |\n| U.S. workforce | <1% | <1% | <1% | CG-MR-330a.1 |\n| Managers | <1% | <1% | <1% | GRI 405-1 |\n| Non-managers | <1% | <1% | <1% | |\n| Officers | <1% | 0% | 0% | |\n| Leadership team | 0% | 0% | 0% | |\n| Board of Directors | 0% | 0% | 0% | |\n| **Percentage two or more races in our U.S. workforce** | | | | |\n| U.S. workforce | 3% | 3% | 2% | CG-MR-330a.1 |\n| Managers | 3% | 2% | 3% | GRI 405-1 |\n| Non-managers | 3% | 3% | 3% | |\n| Officers | 2% | 2% | 1% | |\n| Leadership team | 0% | 0% | 0% | |\n| Board of Directors | 0% | 0% | 0% | |\nProduct quality and safety\n\nThe safety and quality of our products are the foundation of the trust our guests place in our business, and we are committed to offering brands meeting Target\u2019s quality and compliance expectations.\n\nBy 2025, we plan for 100% of our owned brands \u2014 in addition to our owned brand limited-edition and brand partnerships \u2014 to adhere to Target\u2019s already established sustainability standards. Key enablers for overall progress toward this goal include our food safety, quality and regulatory (FSQR) teams, which oversee food and essentials. All products must meet regulatory, safety and quality standards. Our product safety and quality assurance (PSQA) team manages non-food quality and safety, with a focus on regulatory compliance and performance requirements.\n\nAs a company, we are active members of the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA), the National Retail Federation (NRF), The Toy Association and other product-specific groups for non-food products, while food compliance team members have membership of the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA), the Food Industry Association (FMI), the Consumer Brands Association (CBA) and the International Association for Food Protection (IAFP).\n\nGeneral merchandise\n\nTarget\u2019s PSQA team helps protect our guests by requiring that our owned brand products meet mandatory safety standards, and we frequently require owned brand vendors to exceed regulatory requirements and support our responsible sourcing efforts by validating compliance to our Restricted Substances List. PSQA is also responsible for ensuring federal regulatory compliance of national brand products where Target is the importer of record.\n\nWe expect our vendors of owned and national brand products to comply with our manufacturing and quality processes. Our product safety and quality program is incorporated at every stage of the product life cycle of our owned brand products. These products must pass all testing before they are approved for shipment.\n\nFood\n\nWe monitor the safety and quality of our food products through holistic food safety and quality management, from auditing vendor factories and fields to inspecting our supply chain facilities and stores.\n\nProduct recalls\n\nWhen we learn about a concern with one of our products, we investigate and, when necessary, remove it from sale. If a product is recalled, our processes require the in-store and online product to be locked and not to be sold. Multiple communication methods are in place to directly contact consumers about a recall.\n\nRead more about food, safety, quality and compliance on our website.\n\n| Metric | FY2021 | FY2020 | FY2019 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of vendor factories (countries) producing owned brand foods | 980 (29) | 905 (27) | 821 (23) |\n| Number of Global Food Safety Initiative-certified food factories | 1,704 (30) | 1,601 (37) | 1,980 (35) |\n| Number of factories (countries) producing owned brand non-food products | 1,487 | 1,505 | 1,201 |\n| Number of factory evaluations Target conducted | 1,480 | 758 | 1,649 |\n| Number of product test reports for owned brand products conducted by independent third-party labs | 31,627 | 29,750 | 32,633 |\n| Number of product inspections of owned brand products conducted by Target team members and independent third parties | 33,527 | 40,093 | 43,899 |\nAccess to products and services\n\nGoing beyond the need for safe, high-quality products, we also want our guests to feel represented and reflected in all aspects of product, packaging, fit and accessibility. By 2030, Target aims to be the market leader for creating and curating inclusive, sustainable brands and experiences.\n\nTo help us, our Inclusive Design Council seeks to guide relevant owned brand teams in making our products even more inclusive from the design stage. In addition, our Inclusive Merchandising Council reviews products sold by Target to check they are inclusive and representative of our guests and team members.\n\nOur Director of Inclusive Products is responsible for advancing social sustainability within our owned brands, working with internal teams as well as brands, trade groups, certification bodies, diversity organizations, and medical and academic institutions, to map social strategies to business priorities.\n\nTarget in action\n\nAdvancing Design Diversity\n\nThe mission of our Advancing Design Diversity (ADD) initiative is to deliver long-term impact to American design diversity, with a focus on advancing Black talent.\n\nWe recognize the lack of exposure, access and preparation that Black communities, Indigenous communities and other communities of color (BIPOC) face in the design industry. Young aspiring designers are unaware of the range of possibilities open to them and there are many hurdles to pursuing design studies.\n\nTo help address this inequity, we are setting up mentorship relationships with students to increase exposure to opportunities, supporting aspiring design students on the path toward professional careers and/or post-secondary study and develop their skills outside of the traditional college structure. We are also building relationships with professional Black designers to accelerate Black talent.\n\nOur high school mentoring program launched in fall 2021, in partnership with local school districts and leading design schools in three cities: the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, Otis College of Art and Design in Los Angeles and the Savannah College of Art and Design. We funded workshops, events and scholarships for both school year and summer pre-college programming for participants and other BIPOC high school students, and plan to extend the ADD program into Minneapolis and Detroit in 2022.\n\nIn 2021, Target also became a founding supporter of the Pensole Lewis College of Business & Design (PLC), the first historically Black college in the U.S. to be focused on design.\nAccess to products and services\n\nInclusive experiences and responsible marketing\n\nWe sell thousands of curated items, including owned brand products, that give typically underserved guests the shopping experience they deserve. Our merchandising team works to reflect the diversity of our guests in the assortment we offer, including beauty and cosmetics, food, and dolls designed for diverse audiences.\n\nAs the conversation around social justice and racial equity grows, more guests are searching for Black-owned and Black-founded brands. To make it easier for guests to find such products, we have added new icons in the \u201cdetails\u201d section of our products pages to highlight not only Black-, but also Latino-, Asian- and woman-owned suppliers.\n\nPartnering with peers, nonprofits and vendors from the communities we are addressing, 87% of our Black History Month assortment for 2022 was designed with and by Black creators and brands, while 59% of our Pride assortment was designed with and by LGBTQIA+ creators and brands. We also ran team member training for Black History Month, providing background on the current assortment and the collection\u2019s history.\n\nWe launched our Racism Untaught training workshops, which assist in identifying and addressing racialized design approaches by reimagining products, systems and experiences that help avoid micro-aggressions, implicit bias and systemic forms of racism. The training covers 762 owned brand team members, and we are extending the training to our enterprise and vendor partners.\n\nOur Inclusive Marketing Council is a cross-functional group that serves as a crucial source of guidance, helping teams gain a diverse cultural perspective and advocating for cultural literacy so that all guests feel heard, accepted and celebrated. For example, when it comes to our advertising, our swimwear campaigns celebrate people of all sizes, body types, abilities and skin tones, free of airbrushing.\n\nTarget in action\n\nImproving the experience for guests with disabilities\n\nExemplifying our Design For All approach, our Cat & Jack, Pillowfort, Universal Thread, Hyde & EEK! and Goodfellow & Co owned brands offer a selection of stylish and affordable sensory-friendly pieces, as well as adaptive apparel made specially for adults and children living with disabilities. Our internal design team incorporated features like sensory-friendly fabrics (or huggable furniture) and flat seams to help minimize discomfort and help make getting dressed and everyday life moments easier for everyone.\n\nWe are also making guest-facing digital experiences fully accessible to all guests, including those who use assistive technology. Our digital accessibility team includes team members who represent both visible and invisible disabilities, and their perspectives and experiences are invaluable in informing the enhanced experiences we are developing.\n\nReflecting our commitment to accessibility for all, Target scored 100% in the Disability:IN Disability Equality Index survey, and we are a Strategic Nonvisual Accessibility Partner of the National Federation of the Blind.\nCommunity impact\n\nOur success is interdependent with that of the communities we serve. Through Target Forward, we are committed to engaging with communities to build and implement solutions that drive positive impact and accelerate progress toward achieving our sustainability commitments and goals.\n\nCorporate citizenship\n\nTarget strives to be a trusted partner and responsible corporate citizen. Our corporate citizenship work is rooted in reinforcing our company\u2019s purpose \u2014 to help all families discover the joy of everyday life \u2014 by supporting the communities we serve in a relevant, responsive and authentic way that builds brand love and enhances our license to operate.\n\nOur corporate citizenship team fulfills this role every day in how we show up for all families in times of crisis and moments of need, as we work to make meaningful, positive impact through philanthropic investments in our hometown and national communities. As a priority market, we proudly give back in the Twin Cities metro area by supporting civic, social and environmental concerns that align with our giving approach and that matter to the local community.\n\nIn times of crisis, we provide supplies, volunteers and distribution networks through relief organizations. With a global supply chain, we are well positioned to move quickly to support our stores and guests, as well as providing year-round donations and funding to relief partner organizations. Throughout 2021, we contributed more than $7 million in support for Afghan refugees and relief in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, storm Uri in Texas and other disasters across the U.S.\n\nIn 2021, we made a $5 million incremental commitment to community-based NGOs working to advance vaccine equity among diverse populations. For example, as COVID-19 cases soared across India, a $500,000 donation in April 2021 boosted countrywide access to oxygen treatment and more accurate testing. Additional donations were made to local nonprofits delivering vital aid across the country, including Minnesota Council on Foundations, the Minnesota Department of Health Equity Fund and Phyllis Wheatley Community Center Vaccine for Life program. We continued to support our team members in India with additional paid sick leave, time off and family care resources, and we limited local business hours so that people had the flexibility they needed to put their health, and that of their families, first.\n\nOur hometown work focused on rebuilding and equity in 2021. Our efforts to listen and convene community and local business partners together to support our community came to fruition through our participation in many collaborative programs. These included the Minneapolis Downtown Council\u2019s Small Business grant program that provided 102 awards for downtown small businesses through the pandemic; the Minneapolis Foundation\u2019s Restore, Rebuild and Reimagine Fund that helped more than 44 properties with small businesses on critical cultural and commercial corridors to build back stronger following the civil unrest of 2020; as well as public safety grants, product and food donations, and support of the newly formed George Floyd Memorial Foundation.\n\nTeam member giving\n\nWe empower our team members to extend a helping hand to each other. The Target Team Member Giving Fund was created to help colleagues who are facing financial hardship after a natural disaster or unforeseen personal events. The fund relies primarily on contributions from Target, with support from individual donations. Team members across the U.S. and India can apply for a grant up to $2,000 to help in times of hardship.\n\nDuring 2021, $1.2 million was contributed by team members, and nearly $3.1 million in direct support was granted to 3,920 team members.\n\nHoliday Great Gifting Together\n\nOur store and supply chain facilities built partnerships with local nonprofits to bring joy to nearly 3,500 families in need during the holiday season. The program was designed be national in scale but locally relevant. The Target team responded by volunteering their time to purchase, wrap and deliver gifts and essential items in over 1,700 communities nationwide.\n\nTarget Circle\n\nGuests in our Target Circle loyalty program can use the votes they gain with every purchase to direct our funding toward nonprofits, such as food banks, pet shelters and youth programs. In 2021, guests cast 167 million votes to help direct $7 million in grant funding, supporting national scholarship organizations such as the Thurgood Marshall College Fund as well as local community nonprofits.\n\nCommunity vitality\n\nWith stores, supply chain facilities and headquarters offices in over 2,000 communities across the country and world, Target\u2019s community vitality team is dedicated to enabling the vitality and resilience of those communities. By 2030, engage and elevate community voices as we seek to build and implement community-driven solutions.\n\nThe community vitality team works at the local level in three distinct ways: community-based philanthropy, team member engagement and collaboration across the enterprise.\nCommunity impact\n\nCommunity-based philanthropy\nWe provide access to philanthropic support to nonprofits across all communities where we have stores and supply chain facilities, and focus investment in key markets where the majority of our team members and guests live and work. For example, in California, we have partnered with the United Way of Greater Los Angeles (UWGLA) to support its cutting-edge, collaborative programs, impacting the lives of thousands of Angelenos experiencing homelessness each year by building faster and more cost-effectively. Through the Affordable Housing Initiative (AHI), the UWGLA aims to increase access to affordable rental units for those experiencing at risk of homelessness. All of the properties developed will have a service component to contribute almost 900,000 hours of in-person volunteering in 2021. Team members served as election judges, participated in our pop-up food and essential giveaway events in response to civil unrest and took part in a variety of virtual opportunities.\n\nOur team members are generous with their time throughout the year, but they make a particular difference at key awareness events such as Earth Month, National Volunteer Week, 9/11 Day of Service, our Annual Giving Campaign and Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service.\n\nTo empower team members to use their skills and talents to address unmet needs in the community \u2014 and help with rebuilding efforts following the murder of George Floyd \u2014 we launched a pro bono consulting service for BIPOC-owned small businesses in the Twin Cities. In less than one year, we delivered more than 10,000 hours of pro bono support, and in 2021, the program was extended to Atlanta, Chicago and the Bay Area. Looking ahead, we plan to deliver at least 10,000 hours of pro bono support every year.\n\nFinally, our headquarters-based legal team provides hundreds of hours of pro bono legal advice to individuals and organizations, offering guidance on housing law and immigration, and helping low-income individuals to start businesses. In 2021, at least half of our legal professionals participated in pro bono activities.\n\nCross-enterprise collaboration\nGoing beyond philanthropy and team member engagement, our community vitality team works closely with other teams across the enterprise \u2014 from real estate and assets protection to government affairs \u2014 to support community impact.\n\nFor example, when we open a new store, the team engages with local stakeholders to identify ways that we can support the neighborhood, such as local hiring events and celebrating what\u2019s unique in the community.\n\nTarget in action\nEngaging with and listening to Black communities\nWe\u2019ve long been proactive when it comes to engaging with Black communities across the country, but in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder, the corporate responsibility and guest insights teams sought additional feedback to identify what more we could do. In partnership with store team members of color in markets including Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, Oakland and Washington, D.C., we have:\n\n- Focused our work in predominantly Black communities that have not just been acutely impacted by recent traumas but by decades, even centuries, of social injustice.\n- Listened to more than 500 individuals in one-on-one meetings and small groups, and via feedback from surveys.\n- Built trust with stakeholders critical to our business success in these markets, including guests, team members, government officials, small businesses and community organizations working to undo systemic racism and its impacts on Black Americans.\n- Identified the needs of these communities, from meeting basic needs to supporting the vitality of small businesses to supporting the pipeline of Black team members.\n- Made investments and developed programs and partnerships based on our community engagement and understanding of what the community thinks Target\u2019s role at the local level should be.\n\nBy taking time to listen closely to these communities, we were able to identify trusted community partners to support philanthropically and drive team member engagement.\nTarget Foundation\n\nWe envision a world where all families and communities have the resources they need to determine and realize their own joy in life. Through the Target Foundation, we enable shared prosperity and opportunity by upholding equity and inclusion in our hometown, across the country and around the world. Guided by our commitment to community, we invest in leaders, organizations, coalitions and networks that expand economic opportunity equitably, enabling communities to determine their own futures.\n\nBy 2025, Target and Target Foundation plan to evolve our philanthropic practices and place-based solutions to invite participation from communities. The Target Foundation is leaning into trust-based philanthropy to drive systems change, with values rooted in advancing equity, shifting power and building mutually accountable relationships. The Foundation\u2019s capabilities allow it to work toward long-term solutions across complex and interconnected economic issues, grounded in the voices of BIPOC as well as Global South communities and organizations.\n\nThe Target Foundation also closed on its first-ever Program-Related Investment (PRI) to the Minnesota Inclusive Growth Fund (MIGF). MIGF launched late last year to serve as a recovery aid for small businesses in Minnesota that have experienced direct economic hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the civil unrest following the murder of George Floyd. The goal of MIGF is to connect small businesses to affordable, flexible working capital loans to rebuild and reinvest in their businesses.\n\nOur Target Foundation work supports three focus areas:\n\n| Focus area | Engagement highlights |\n|------------|-----------------------|\n| Hometown: Advancing racial equity and shared prosperity in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul | The Mni Sota Fund is an Urban Native Community Development Financial Institution that provides training and access to capital to promote homeownership, entrepreneurship and financial capabilities among American Indian men and women throughout Minnesota. Founded in 2012, the Mni Sota Fund was created in response to community conversations about key tools missing from the Native community development ecosystem in the Twin Cities. Target Foundation\u2019s grant helps the Fund in creating a thriving ecosystem of American Indian entrepreneurs throughout the Twin Cities with a vibrant Native-business district on the American Indian Cultural Corridor, as well as widespread American Indian homeownership and financial empowerment. |\n| National: Building financial stability and economic opportunity for working people and their families in a rapidly changing economy | We support the work of National Coalition for Asian Pacific American Community Development (National CAPACD), a group of local community organizations that advocate for low-income Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities and neighborhoods. The organization strengthens and mobilizes its members to build economic power and further its vision of economic and social justice for all. Target Foundation\u2019s funding supports National CAPACD in a number of areas, including building capacity; supporting local community-based organizations (CBOs) to foster financial stabilization and well-being for low- to moderate-income AAPIs; and building the capacity of CBOs to engage in broader systems change work. |\n| Global: Improving economic opportunities for families in emerging economies to sustain themselves and their communities for the long term | We\u2019re proud to support the work of Friendship Bridge, a nonprofit social enterprise creating opportunities that empower Guatemalan women to build a better life. Target Foundation\u2019s grant supports its Bridge to Success program, which delivers intensive business development training and specialized financial services to women entrepreneurs with the goals of increasing resilience, empowerment and community leadership, and accelerating economic opportunities for the participants and their communities. |\n\nPhoto credit: Friendship Bridge, Target Foundation partner\n## Volunteerism and philanthropy\n\n| Metric                                                                 | FY2021   | FY2020   | FY2019   | Scope                                                                 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Number of hours volunteered                                            | 870,064  | 496,260  | 1,064,215| Target team members (not necessarily during paid working hours)       |\n| Regular volunteer hours                                                | 853,950  | 494,098  | 1,064,215|                                                                        |\n| Pro bono hours                                                         | 16,114   | 2,162    | N/A      |                                                                        |\n| Amount donated through Target and Target Foundation (USD)              | $274 million | $245 million | $225 million |                                                                        |\n| Cash                                                                   | $80 million | $70 million | $68 million |                                                                        |\n| In kind                                                                | $194 million | $175 million | $157 million |                                                                        |\n| Amount donated through Target and Target Foundation (USD) to:          |          |          |          |                                                                        |\n| Organizations that support underrepresented communities in the U.S.    | $144 million | $124 million | $105 million | Target + Target Foundation                                           |\n| Local community programs and organizations                             | $257 million | $231 million | $199 million |                                                                        |\n| Disaster preparedness and response                                     | $8 million | $12 million | $1.3 million |                                                                        |\n| Amount of food donated\\(^{56}\\)                                        |          |          |          |                                                                        |\n| By weight (pounds)                                                     | 106.0 million | 94.5 million | 93.9 million | Target                                                               |\n| By number of meals                                                     | 88.3 million | 78.7 million | 78.2 million |                                                                        |\n| Guest-directed giving through Target Circle                            |          |          |          |                                                                        |\n| Number of guests engaged                                               | 5.0 million | 4.8 million | 2.3 million | Target                                                               |\n| Number of grants distributed                                           | 1,675    | 2,527    | 972      |                                                                        |\n| Value of grants distributed (USD)                                      | $7.0 million | $7.0 million | $2.4 million |                                                                        |\n| Team member giving                                                     |          |          |          |                                                                        |\n| Percentage of team members participating in the Team Member Giving Campaig\\(^{57}\\) | 92%      | 90%      | 94%      | Target team members                                                   |\n| Amount donated by team members through our annual giving campaign (USD) | $9.1 million | $9.6 million | $10.4 million |                                                                        |\n\n\\(^{56}\\) In 2020, we updated our meals calculation to mirror industry best practice, which we did by removing non-food donations and pet food from the meals calculation. The figures in the metrics reflect these changes.\n\n\\(^{57}\\) Overall engagement with the Team Member Giving Campaign, including cash donations.\nOur economic opportunity to serve communities\n\nTo drive economic mobility and inclusion in society, we seek to reduce barriers and enable people to gain skills, find and secure enhanced opportunities, and ultimately improve their economic well-being.\n\nTo create an equitable future for all, in October 2021, we committed to invest $100 million by 2025 to fuel economic prosperity in Black communities, as part of our REACH commitments. The funding will build on the $10 million we pledged to social justice causes in 2020, and complements our 2021 plan to significantly invest in Black-owned businesses.\n\nFunding will also go to helping Black-led nonprofits advancing racial equity and creating economic opportunity in Black communities. For example, the Minnesota Holistic Black-Led Movement Fund \u2014 part of the Philanthropic Collective to Combat Anti-Blackness & Realize Racial Justice \u2014 provides grants for transformative solutions that drive racial equity and justice.\n\nEducation\nOur approach encompasses financial assistance to help students continue their education, as well as scholarships, internships, mentoring and other support.\n\nTarget Scholars Program\nAs part of this investment, we introduced our Target Scholars Program in April 2021. In partnership with the United Negro College Fund (UNCF), the program provides 1,000 first-year students from HBCUs with $5,000 scholarships and access to mentoring, internship and networking opportunities. Target Scholars studying technology, design and leadership are supported with four years of college and career counseling, access to Target\u2019s HBCU design challenges and early exposure to explore internships.\n\nWe continue to listen and learn from the UNCF, HBCU alumni and Target Scholars so that we can best support scholars through their full college experience, and have announced plans for how we can maintain that support past their freshman year.\n\nPensole Lewis College\nIn 2021, Target became a founding supporter of the Pensole Lewis College of Business & Design (PLC), which is the first historically Black college in the U.S. to be reopened and the first to focus on design. Target will support Pensole\u2019s mission in providing free tuition for aspiring Black designers, engineers and business leaders.\n\nEmployment\nWe\u2019re proud to have launched and sustained millions of careers over our 100-year history. As we\u2019ve grown, we\u2019ve taken care to maintain high standards for rewarding employment to new members of the workforce.\n\nWe strive to build and retain a team that reflects the communities we serve. Target uses a variety of recruiting resources and partnerships through which we can source from diverse talent pools.\n\nWe have also made commitments with organizations such as OneTen, which is focused on hiring, promoting and advancing one million Black individuals without a four-year degree into family-sustaining careers over the next 10 years, to help close opportunity gaps across the U.S. We are proud to be a part of the coalition that plans to train, hire and advance one million Black Americans in the Twin Cities.\n\nLearn more about careers at Target online.\nElevating equity in supply chains and communities\n\nWe\u2019ve been building strong partnerships with diverse suppliers and underrepresented businesses for decades, leveraging our scale as a purchaser to support economic development and enhance our guests\u2019 shopping experiences.\n\nPropelled by our new Target Forward strategy, which focuses on creating an equitable and regenerative future, we\u2019re advancing equity beyond the Board and workplace to our supply chain, as well as the communities we serve. By 2025, we plan for 100% of our suppliers to have policies and programs to advance gender equity in supply chains, and for owned brand suppliers to pay workers digitally.\n\nOur commitment to supplier diversity\n\nEvery year, we work hard to find, attract and retain more diverse-owned suppliers. We are proud to work with an ever-growing roster of suppliers that are at least 51% owned, controlled and operated by women, BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, veterans or people with disabilities.\n\nIn April 2021, as part of our REACH commitments, we launched our plan to spend more than $2 billion with Black-owned businesses by the end of 2025. This commitment involves:\n\n- Increasing the number of products from Black-owned businesses to more than 500 across our stores and online.\n- Spending more with Black-owned companies, including marketing agencies, construction companies, facilities maintenance providers and others.\n- Establishing new resources to engage with early-stage historically under-resourced entrepreneurs to provide education on scaling for mass retail.\n\nTo that end, we build relationships with such suppliers through multiple national business groups, including the National Minority Supplier Development Council and National LGBT Chamber of Commerce. In addition, together with the Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC), we are a founding partner and premier sponsor of Women Owned in Retail, a program designed to help women-owned consumer goods businesses thrive in the retail space. We also host onsite and virtual summits to introduce Target merchants and others to potential new, diverse partners.\n\nGlobally, we are working to extend supplier diversity within our international supply chain. We have identified three priorities \u2014 women, people with disabilities and other underrepresented groups \u2014 and have connected with WeConnect (the global women\u2019s partner to WBENC, an entity with operations in the U.S. only) and Disability:IN to support this work.\n\nElevating worker well-being in the supply chain\n\nWe engage with strategic stakeholders to address issues that matter to supply chain workers. By the end of fiscal year 2021, our collaborative projects related to worker well-being impacted the lives of more than 3.7 million people.\n\nThroughout 2021, we pivoted our worker well-being approach toward our 2025 goals, which focus on gender equity and the digitization of wages for workers in our owned brand supply chain. We began working to align our strategies with external organizations that enable thought partnership and future progress. Below are examples of partnerships that exemplify this approach.\n\n- Better Than Cash Alliance (BTCA): We became a member of this UN-based alliance in 2022 to support our commitment that all owned brand suppliers pay workers digitally by 2025, following responsible practices.\n- CARE: Target continues to partner with CARE International, designing strategies to drive gender equity throughout our sourcing practices and extended supply chain.\n- BSR: Target supports BSR\u2019s HERproject to empower female supply chain workers through workplace-based health, financial inclusion and gender equality interventions.\n- International Center for Research on Women (ICRW): Through our partnership with the center\u2019s advisory arm, ICRW Advisors, Target is contributing to the further development of ICRW\u2019s Self-Diagnostic Tool. This industry-aligned resource helps factories assess their gender equity policies and processes and generates a customized scorecard on existing gender integration policies and practices to encourage continuous improvement.\n\n### Accelerators\n\n| Metric | FY2021 | FY2020 | FY2019 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of companies supported by Target Accelerators during the fiscal year | | | |\n| Target Takeoff | 31 | 25 | 17 |\n| Target Incubator | 0 | 8 | 8 |\n| Target Technology Accelerator | 0 | 10 | 9 |\n| Target Accelerator Program India | 5 | 10 | 10 |\n| Number of products on shelves in Target stores from graduates of Target Accelerators (SKUs) | 220 | 123 | 59 |\nElevating equity in supply chains and communities\n\nPrioritizing health and safety\nProviding a safe and healthy working environment for workers is a key expectation for our vendors. The Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability audit program focuses on health and safety violations to minimize safety risks. Target collaborates with industry-led initiatives like Nirapon and Life and Building Safety (LABS) to enhance worker safety and create a culture of minimizing occupational hazards in our supply chain.\n\nAs a founding member of LABS, a global collaborative initiative of apparel brands and retailers, Target is working to assess safety risks related to structure, electricity, fire safety and evacuation preparedness, and remediates them in line with global best practices in our apparel and footwear factories. Through Nirapon\u2019s Safety Management program, we are committed to driving safety requirements in Bangladesh factories, along with worker training and helpline support.\n\nProduct suppliers\nAccelerator programs\nOur portfolio of Target Accelerator programs offers investment, access, expertise and mentoring, equipping historically under-resourced founders and entrepreneurs to drive innovation, instigate change and build their businesses. In 2021, 45% of the applications we received came from Black-owned brands.\n\nOne of our accelerators, Target Takeoff, is a five-week program that supports startups. In 2021, we ran three Takeoff cohorts, covering Beauty, Food and Beverage, and Pets, and 30% of the cohort participants were Black-owned brands. Thirteen brands that have graduated from Takeoff in previous years launched at Target, and overall, 40% of Takeoff alumni have received a Target business award.\n\nTakeoff Beauty, our longest-running accelerator program, saw a 79% increase in applications from 2020 to 2021, and 52% of the applicants were from Black-owned beauty businesses. In 2020, Cora Miller, founder of the Black-owned Young King Haircare, participated in the program and her business has since launched in 365 Target stores. We aim to elevate more entrepreneurs like Cora, who is among a group of fewer than 100 Black female entrepreneurs to raise more than $1 million in venture funds.\n\nForward Founders\nBuilding off the success of our accelerator programs, we co-created Forward Founders with Black entrepreneurs from our Entrepreneurship Advisory Council. The Forward Founders program engages Black-owned retail businesses earlier in their startup journey, giving them access to subject matter experts and educational workshops. This program is designed to help them navigate the critical stages of ideation, product development and scaling up, and increase their potential for long-term success. The inaugural Forward Founders program received 3,100 applications, 73% of which came from Black-owned businesses.\n\nWe also launched a six-part Retail Knowledge Speaker Series for those Forward Founder applicants who were not chosen to participate in the program, giving them support on their entrepreneurial journey. The series had more than 1,900 attendees and received an average Net Promoter Score of 73.\n\nBet on Black\nAs part of our multimillion-dollar investment in the Black-owned multimedia platform REVOLT, we\u2019ve co-created a new project to help us more innovatively connect with Black guests. Bet on Black is a new pitch-style competition series highlighting 12 Black-owned startups \u2014 which continue to be underrepresented in venture funding \u2014 with innovative ideas for revolutionizing their industries. Target is providing $500,000 in funding for the startups without requiring any equity stake so each company can retain full ownership and control of their business.\n\nProperty suppliers\nIn addition to supporting growth in the diversity of our product suppliers, we\u2019re also actively engaging BIPOC-owned businesses to service our properties.\n\nIn 2019, Target Properties developed an internal mentor program to help BIPOC-owned businesses navigate the process of becoming active Target suppliers, and our first cohort of mentees started in 2020. We searched the country for potential suppliers to support our heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) business. Currently, there are seven Black-owned HVAC businesses that are learning how Target does business, to prepare them to participate in active projects. Through 2021 and beyond, we are seeking more mentor cohorts to cover more product categories.\n\nDiverse and local suppliers\n\n| Metric | FY2021 | FY2020 | FY2019 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of diverse suppliers | 1,279 | 702 | 442 |\n| New | 467 | 297 | 81 |\n| Amount of spending with diverse suppliers | | | |\n| Tier 1 (USD) | $2,483 million | $1,471 million | $1,043 million |\n| Tier 2 (USD) | $783 million | $764 million | $1,899 million |\n| Percentage change in Tier 1 spending with diverse suppliers year-over-year | 69% | 41% | -26% |\n| Percentage of diverse supplier bid inclusion | 52% | 52% | 46% |\n| Percentage of the procurement budget spent on suppliers local to Minnesota and three counties in Western Wisconsin (Polk, St. Croix and Pierce) | 2% | 4% | 5% |\nGovernance\nGovernance Overview\n\nBuilt on ethics\n\nWe are responsible for establishing and abiding by strong, ethical corporate governance practices and policies that reflect our core values. Our commitment requires that we hold ourselves accountable to setting and working toward measurable goals, and to regularly report on our performance across our ESG priority issues in a manner that informs, engages and is transparent to all stakeholders.\n\nOur work contributes to the following SDGs:\n\n- Patents awarded to our cybersecurity team to date: 20+\n- Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability training programs delivered: 17\n- Recognition for ESG performance:\n  - ISS: Maintained ESG Prime status\n  - CDP: Recognized on the CDP\u2019s Supplier Engagement Rating Leaderboard 2021\n- Internal team members and suppliers trained on Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability: 3,155\n- Total Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability training hours: 6,500+\n- We\u2019ve been sharing corporate responsibility efforts since Target first published a Community Involvement Report in 1969\n- Percentage of workforce eligible to receive paid time off to vote: 100%\n\nFrameworks reported on:\n\n- GRI\n- SASB\n- SDG\n- TCFD\n- UNGPF\nOperating Ethically\nFor our business to be successful while delivering social and environmental benefits, we must maintain a foundation of integrity, transparency and ethical practices.\n\nWe\u2019ve identified leads and teams in the areas necessary to effectively execute against these values, and distributed oversight responsibilities across our Board of Directors and its committees, while providing team members and suppliers with the resources needed for compliance. We employ industry-leading tools and partnerships to stay ahead \u2014 whether that be addressing cybersecurity threats or implementing new approaches to traceability. Measuring and reporting on our progress through best-in-class ESG frameworks guides our business and builds trust.\n\nOur practices reflect the rights, roles and responsibilities of our Board and management to effectively serve all our stakeholders, including team members, guests, shareholders, vendors and the communities in which we operate.\n\nPromoting and Protecting Human Rights\nTarget is committed to a sustainable and inclusive supply chain that is just and equitable for all workers.\n\nWe advocate for human rights to create safe, thriving communities through an approach aligned with leading international standards, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization Core Conventions and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\nWe also participate in Business for Social Responsibility (BSR)\u2019s Human Rights Working Group, which provides a platform where global companies across industries come together to share actionable guidance, challenges and lessons learned.\nManaging ESG issues\n\nAt the management level, our ESG-related activities are led and coordinated by our Senior Vice President, Corporate Responsibility, who regularly engages with our Board of Directors and its Governance & Sustainability Committee.\n\nThe Senior Vice President, Corporate Responsibility, is responsible for:\n\n- Conducting regular priority assessments to determine the topics of most significance to our stakeholders.\n- Collaborating with other members of management to instill ESG-related priorities into our business operations, including product design and development, sourcing and supply chain operations, human capital management and our new store development.\n- Developing ESG-related goals and managing our ESG data, measurement and reporting.\n\nIn September 2021, the Board revised its committee structure and charters to clarify and enhance its approach to oversight of risk and ESG matters by reallocating to its committees oversight responsibility for those topics that fall within their respective functions and related responsibilities. The revised structure and charters for the committees were guided by our prior Board and committee self-evaluations, the evolving needs of our business and consideration of external trends in corporate governance. In addition, we believe the changes appropriately reflect how companies are adjusting to current expectations of Board oversight of ESG matters.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to invest resources into growing our transparency and reporting around ESG matters through the creation of an ESG team within corporate responsibility.\n\nBoard composition and diversity\n\nThe criteria the Board follows in determining the composition of the Board are as follows:\n\n- Directors are to have broad perspective, experience, knowledge and independent judgment.\n- The Board as a whole should consist predominantly of persons with strong business backgrounds that span multiple industries.\n- The Board does not have a specific policy regarding consideration of gender, ethnic or other diversity criteria in identifying director candidates, but understands the value of diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) and has a strong history of gender and racial/ethnic diversity on the Board.\n\nAs of January 29, 2022, 38% of Board members were female, while 31% were racially or ethnically diverse.\n\nRead more about the gender and racial/ethnic diversity of our workforce, managers and Board of Directors online.\nEthical business decisions not only comply with laws, regulations and standards that govern our business but also uphold our values, strengthen our brand, build trust and maintain connections with our team members, guests and communities.\n\nOur compliance and ethics team oversees our Ethics program. Target team members are expected to do what\u2019s right for our business, their colleagues and our guests, modeling a strong ethical culture through their everyday decisions and actions.\n\n**Code of Ethics**\n\nTeam members are required to follow applicable laws, Target policies and our Code of Ethics. They are expected to report any actual or suspected violations, to which Target will respond promptly and appropriately. The Code of Ethics outlines team members\u2019 duty to also report any conflicts of interest immediately if they arise, and select team members must complete Target\u2019s Conflicts of Interest Statement annually.\n\nOur Board members have a separate Code of Ethics, contained within our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which is tailored to their unique role. New members participate in an orientation program that covers different business aspects, including ESG-related activities.\n\n**Business Partner Code of Conduct**\n\nBecause the actions of our suppliers and business partners reflect directly on Target, we expect them to share our commitment to the fundamental principles of respect for human rights and environmental stewardship. Our Business Partner Code of Conduct (formerly Vendor Code of Conduct) communicates this expectation and, in 2021, we updated it to include equity and inclusion initiatives. Suppliers must conduct their business with a high level of integrity and maintain transparent and accurate records. Violations of the Business Partner Code of Conduct could result in an end to the business relationship with Target.\n\n**Ethics and compliance training**\n\nWe provide team members with guidance on ethics and compliance responsibilities relevant to their roles. Mandatory training is delivered during onboarding and then annually to reinforce these responsibilities.\n\nWe offer trainings covering key topics like anti-bribery, conflicts of interest, government interactions, anti-competitive behavior, environment, food safety and privacy. We also hold trainings on employment compliance, tailored to specific operations and team functions.\n\n**Anti-hate, anti-violence and anti-racism**\n\nIn recent years, we have witnessed a rise in societal incidences of hate-based violence and racism against groups and communities, including women, people of particular faiths, people with disabilities and people in the BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ communities. We condemn all hate, racism and violence, and have introduced anti-racism experiences, immersions and trainings for all team members.\n\n**Anti-bribery and corruption**\n\nWe do not tolerate unethical or illegal business practices. Our Code of Ethics and Anti-Bribery Policy provide guidance that all team members must understand and follow. We strive to comply with all applicable anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and require similar compliance from vendors, suppliers, contractors, subcontractors and their agents. Team members who interact with government officials receive additional training to reinforce our anti-bribery policies and practices.\n\n**Anti-competitive behavior**\n\nWe believe that, by complying with competition and antitrust laws, we support free and fair competition between companies. Our Antitrust Policy requires team members to comply with applicable laws and prohibits them from making agreements that restrain competition.\n\n**Transparency and reporting**\n\nTo achieve transformative change, we believe Target must carefully manage and measure our performance against tangible goals and publicly report on our progress. Staying accountable for impacts and actions is how we maintain the trust of our suppliers, guests, team members, shareholders and partners. All Target stakeholders are engaged and involved in our ESG commitments and responsibilities.\n\nWe have been sharing our corporate responsibility efforts since 1969, when we published our first Community Involvement Report. Starting in 2010, we began publishing comprehensive corporate responsibility activities and information online.\n\nWe leverage several globally recognized ESG frameworks for monitoring, measuring and disclosing annual progress, including:\n\n- Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)\n- Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)\n- UN Sustainability Development Goals (UN SDGs)\n- Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n- UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework (UNGPRF)\nWe are committed to pursuing responsible purchasing practices that help us act as a fair business partner.\n\nWe have therefore set a goal to formally evaluate the way we do business with those who manufacture our products.\n\nThrough our partnership with Better Buying, a nonprofit organization focused on improving purchasing practices throughout the global supply chain, we annually assess the impact of our purchasing practices on supplier sustainability through a financial, environmental and social lens. We leverage this assessment to better understand how our day-to-day purchasing practices are affecting our suppliers, their workers and the environment.\n\nIn partnership with Better Buying, we rolled out a new educational training course to help commercial teams understand what purchasing practices are, why they are essential and how decisions can impact workers worldwide.\n\nIn the year ahead, we will continue to deepen our relationships with new and existing partners to achieve our ambitions. Learn more about our focus areas for this work at target.com/targetforward.\n\n**Traceability and sustainability**\n\nIn support of our Target Forward strategy, as well as advancing our material strategies, Target is implementing traceability programs.\n\nRead more about responsibly sourced commodities, environmental protection and social standards in our supply chain, and our work to limit the use of conflict minerals in our owned brand products.\n\n**Social responsibility in the supply chain**\n\nWe are dedicated to using our reach and influence to protect people and uphold social responsibility standards throughout our global supply chain.\n\nAll our vendor relationships are guided by the Business Partner Code of Conduct. This includes our Standards of Vendor Engagement (SOVE), which outlines our expectations for vendors and serves as the anchor for embedding human rights throughout our supply chain, alongside our labor and human rights policies.\n\nThese core documents define the scope of our vendors\u2019 ethical operations obligations.\n\nAdditionally, Applying Target\u2019s SOVE is a detailed guidebook on Target\u2019s expectations for supply chain human rights, as well as environmental standards we expect from suppliers, and has been made available to vendors in 10 different languages.\n\nWe expect all our domestic and international business partners to respect human rights, and to comply with Target\u2019s SOVE and all applicable laws pertaining to human rights, including, without limitation, all laws applicable to workplace health, safety, labor and employment.\n\n**Grievances**\n\nWe are committed to providing Target team members and workers in our supply chain with access to effective grievance mechanisms. We expect our business partners to share any concerns of potential misconduct so that we can investigate and address concerns promptly. In 2022, we partnered with human rights consultancy Article One to create an in-depth training experience for our sourcing team members worldwide. This is intended to deepen their understanding of human rights issues and to recognize the importance of having effective grievance mechanisms in place for all workers in our supply chain.\n\nOur ethics and responsible sourcing and sustainability teams conduct ethics training with business partners in many parts of the world. The training promotes the Target Integrity Hotline, a channel available to all team members and supplier workers for confidentially reporting issues related to our SOVE; the call is free and handled by an independent third party, and local language interpreters are available. We do not share or publish specific grievances or specific issues raised and do not tolerate any retaliation against any team member who reports in good faith.\n\nOur suppliers should also maintain effective grievance mechanisms for workers, aligned with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. During 2021, we distributed information on accessing and engaging with Target\u2019s Integrity Hotline to all factory and supplier locations. Target continues to explore opportunities to increase accessibility to reporting options and drive comfort in using the reporting options provided.\n\nIn the event that a grievance is raised, Target will thoroughly investigate all issues and manage them to closure through our Sensitive Case Program.\nIn the event that a grievance is considered to be founded, Target will engage with its business partners to aim to remediate adverse human rights impacts. In some cases, we will partner with globally recognized nonprofit organizations such as Verit\u00e9, Impactt and The Centre for Child Rights and Business to support capability building and remediation of complex workplace human rights issues, to be sure that we are providing the most effective solution.\n\nWe support suppliers in collecting data on grievance types, resolution and mechanism channels, and through third-party helplines associated with our audit program partners, enhancing effectiveness and worker engagement. Our Responsible Sourcing Advisory Program leverages tools from the Better Work Academy and advises suppliers on establishing and executing grievance mechanisms and monitoring performance.\n\n### Social responsibility in the supply chain\n\n| Metric | FY2021 | FY2020 | FY2019 | Framework |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Number of registered manufacturing facilities | 4,114 | 3,965 | 3,696 | GRI 102-9 |\n| China | 2,247 | 2,188 | 2,165 | SASB |\n| Southeast Asia | 444 | 398 | 322 | CG-HP-000.B |\n| The Americas | 1,064 | 1,084 | 970 | |\n| India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Egypt and Turkey | 222 | 178 | 159 | |\n| Other | 137 | 117 | 80 | |\n| Number of countries in which we have registered manufacturing facilities | 54 | 49 | 49 | GRI 102-9 |\n| Number of countries in which we conducted audits | 44 | 29 | 26 | |\n| Percentage of supplier facilities that were audited to a labor code of conduct | 70% | 39% | 49% | GRI 412-1 |\n| Tier 1 | 42% | 23% | 0% | SASB |\n| Tier 1 audit penetration rate | 70% | 42% | 41% | GRI 412-1 and 414-2 |\n| Percentage of total audits conducted by a third-party auditor | >99% | 89% | 0% | SASB |\n| Percentage of new suppliers screened using social criteria | 100% | 100% | 100% | |\n\n58 Primary Tier 1 factories.\n59 Travel and factory restrictions, as well as office closures related to COVID-19, decreased the ability for onsite audits to be conducted in certain areas.\n60 \u201cAcceptable\u201d is defined as the percentage of \u201cOutstanding\u201d and \u201cAcceptable\u201d audit results. This is not broken down by social and environmental categories, but is an overall rating that is inclusive of everything that makes up our SOVE.\nInformation security, cybersecurity and data privacy\n\nSecuring our systems, networks, information about our business and information we have about our guests, team members, vendors and other third parties is important to us.\n\nWhen handling personal information, we follow laws, policies and processes that help us collect, use and share the information appropriately while still allowing us to serve our guests and run our business operations.\n\nManagement and oversight\n\nWhile every Target team member plays a part in information security, cybersecurity and data privacy, oversight responsibility is shared by the Board of Directors, its committees and management.\n\nManagement provides regular updates to the Board and/or Audit & Risk Committee on these topics throughout the year. In addition, at least annually, the Chief Information Security Officer provides an information security program review and the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) provides a privacy program update to the Audit & Risk Committee.\n\n| Responsible party | Oversight area |\n|-------------------|----------------|\n| Board             | Oversight of information security, cybersecurity and data privacy within Target\u2019s overall risks. |\n| Audit & Risk Committee | Primary oversight responsibility for information security, cybersecurity and data privacy, including internal controls designed to mitigate risks related to these topics. |\n| Management        | Our Chief Information Officer, Chief Legal & Risk Officer, Chief Information Security Officer, CCO and senior members of our cybersecurity, compliance and ethics teams are responsible for identifying and managing risks related to these topics, and reporting to the Audit & Risk Committee and/or the full Board. |\n\nInformation security and cybersecurity\n\nOur cybersecurity team is responsible for designing and implementing Target\u2019s information security and cybersecurity program, including governance, policy, risk assessment, monitoring and training. We use a combination of industry-leading tools and in-house technologies to protect Target and our guests, operate a proactive threat intelligence program to identify and assess risk, and run a Cyber Fusion Center to investigate and respond to threats in real time.\n\nOur cyber threat intelligence team works to understand evolving threats and industry trends, and our vendor security team monitors and assesses risk with our suppliers. We also offer ongoing practice and education for team members to recognize and report suspicious activity.\n\nWe invest in building and developing cybersecurity talent and engineering expertise in-house, and offer educational courses through our Cyber Plus Institute, a security training curriculum leveraging internal expertise as well as curated resources. We also engage with leading security and technology vendors to evaluate our information security and cybersecurity program and test our technical capabilities.\n\nTo date, our team has more than 20 patents, with more pending, and we actively share, and contribute to, open source solutions. One solution, Merry Maker \u2014 designed to protect Target.com from \u201cdigital skimming\u201d \u2014 has been open sourced to help other cybersecurity teams develop their own defense systems.\n\nWe also seek to be a leader in cybersecurity and have been recognized for our commitment to cross-industry information sharing and collaboration with organizations. Target leaders serve on the boards of the Retail & Hospitality Information Sharing and Analysis Center, the Financial Services Information Sharing Analysis Center, the Aspin Cybersecurity Group and the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council Board of Advisors.\n\nTo complement our DE&I strategy, we partner with organizations \u2014 including the Executive Women\u2019s Forum, Women in CyberSecurity and Cyversity \u2014 to strengthen support networks for team members and build a more diverse talent pipeline.\n\nData privacy\n\nOur privacy compliance team is responsible for designing and implementing Target\u2019s privacy program, including governance, policy, risk assessment, monitoring and training. The team identifies and manages privacy risks, elevating them to our CCO and Chief Legal & Risk Officer. The team\u2019s work to design privacy controls into operations is supported with continual learning and professional certification opportunities, including Certified Information Privacy Professional designations.\n\nOur retail Privacy Policy details how we collect, use and share guest personal information. It also informs guests of their options for limiting marketing or other uses of their data. In addition, the policy expressly states that Target does not knowingly collect personal information online from children aged under 13. Everyone at Target who works with personal information must comply with our internal Privacy Compliance Policy.\n\nTeam members receive annual training to understand the requirements around collecting, using and sharing personal information. Third parties that handle personal information must also follow applicable laws, regulations and contractual obligations.\n\nWe conduct external cross-industry benchmarking to understand privacy best practices and industry trends and actively contribute to the Retail Industry Leaders Association\u2019s Privacy Leaders Council and the National Retail Federation\u2019s Privacy Working Group.\nGovernment advocacy\n\nAs one of the largest employers in the U.S., we believe we have a constructive role to play in discussions on relevant public policy issues.\n\nWe engage with elected officials of all major political parties at all levels of government to formulate equitable, effective public policies for our business and industry, our team members, guests and communities.\n\nThe Governance & Sustainability Committee of our Board is charged with overseeing our policies and practices regarding public policy advocacy and political activities. Read more on our website about the top issues, such as investing in our team and protecting privacy, that we explored last year.\n\nTeam members are guided by our Political Activities, Lobbying and Government Ethics Policy, and must comply with all campaign finance, lobbying and government ethics laws and regulations. In addition to our own policies and disclosure practices, we adhere to applicable laws that govern interactions with public officials.\n\nPromoting civic engagement\n\nWe proudly stand in support of democracy, providing meaningful opportunities for civic participation for our team members and guests, including supporting their right to vote.\n\nTeam members can join our Citizens@Target network, a resource for promoting informed civic engagement. The network hosts information sessions and provides nonpartisan information to help team members get involved in the community in ways that matter to them.\n\nWe have long offered paid time off to vote and, in 2020, expanded paid time off to work as an election judge. In 2021, we increased our support, providing additional nonpartisan tools and resources to encourage all team members to participate in state and local elections. We also offer team members a discounted trip to their polling place on Election Day through a partnership with Lyft.\n\nWe also remain committed to ensuring guests and communities can safely and freely cast their ballots, partnering with various national organizations to enhance access to voting. Most recently, we joined 250 businesses as members of the Business for Voting Rights coalition and called on Congress to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The coalition seeks to prohibit racial discrimination in voting laws, ensuring equal access to the democratic process. During 2021, we publicly shared our voting rights principles and advocated for federal legislation in alignment with those principles.\n\nTarget in action\n\nOur REACH aims for civic engagement and public policy\n\nAs part of our Racial Equity Action and Change (REACH) commitments, Target is committed to working with policymakers to address key issues such as advancing education and economic opportunities for Black Americans, reducing barriers to voting for Black Americans, safety and police reform.\n\nWe recognize that we\u2019re coming into this work without having all the answers. While our approach focuses on Black team members, guests and communities, we are committed to maintaining an open mind and collaborating with multiple community voices.\n\nRead more about our REACH commitments.\nOur political advocacy\n\nAs a retailer and employer of approximately 450,000 team members, we have a role to play in informing policymakers on legislative issues. Together with trade associations and policy-based organizations, we advocate at all levels of government to enhance understanding of the impact of legislative and regulatory issues on our business, industry, team members and communities. One way we connect with elected officials is through contributions from our TargetCitizens Political Action Committee (PAC). TargetCitizens PAC is funded by voluntary contributions from eligible team members and contributes in a bipartisan manner to federal candidates and organizations.\n\nPAC contributions are based on policy and business priorities. Given the diversity of interests, viewpoints and the broad membership represented by candidates and organizations, the positions they take do not always reflect Target\u2019s purpose and beliefs.\n\nTarget corporate political contributions\n\nJanuary 1 \u2013 December 31, 2021\n\nThe following is a list of contributions of general corporate funds in the amount of $5,000 or more to support or oppose the election of candidates for office or ballot initiatives.\n\n| Organization                                      | Contribution |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Illinois Merchants Political Action Committee Team| $22,000      |\n| Women in Power PAC                                 | $15,000      |\n| California Legislative Black Caucus                | $15,000      |\n| Florida Retail Federation PAC                       | $13,000      |\n| California Chamber of Commerce PAC                 | $7,200       |\n| California Retailers Association (CalRetailers)    | $7,200       |\n| New York Senate Republican Caucus                  | $5,000       |\n| New York Assembly Democratic Caucus                | $5,000       |\n| New York Senate Democratic Caucus                  | $5,000       |\n| New York Assembly Republican Caucus                | $5,000       |\n| New York Retailers for Effective Government         | $5,000       |\n| LGBT Caucus Leadership Fund                         | $5,000       |\n| California Business Properties Association         | $5,000       |\n\nTarget is also a member of national organizations. Our team members attend events hosted by these organizations to learn about elected officials\u2019 policy priorities and initiatives, and to share a retail perspective. Target expressly requires that our funds only support educational and association management activities and are not used as campaign contributions. Because these organizations also engage in political efforts, we disclose our memberships as political contributions.\n\n| Organization                                      | Contribution |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Congressional Black Caucus Foundation              | $100,000     |\n| National Governors Association                     | $60,000      |\n| Attorney General Alliance                          | $50,000      |\n| US Conference of Mayors                            | $50,000      |\n| National Conference of State Legislatures          | $27,500      |\n| Western Governors\u2019 Association                     | $15,000      |\n| National Black Caucus of State Legislators         | $15,000      |\n| National Hispanic Caucus of State Legislators      | $15,000      |\n\nApproximate number of full-time, part-time and seasonal team members employed as of January 29, 2022.\nWe use contracts, audits, policies, specialized programming and other measures to help us respect the rights of the people and communities who make our products.\n\nOur due diligence involves efforts to avoid adverse human rights impacts from our business activities and mitigate salient risks. It also includes our work to address any issues identified, as well as opportunities for making a positive impact that uplifts people and communities.\n\nWhile executive oversight sits with our Senior Vice President, Corporate Responsibility, daily efforts are led by multiple teams, with support from a cross-functional task force that reviews and addresses emerging issues. Read more about human rights oversight in our 2022 Proxy Statement and our Human Rights Statement.\n\nIdentifying human rights impacts\n\nIn 2022, Target partnered with Article One, an expert business and human rights consultancy, to conduct an updated human rights impact assessment (HRIA) for our operations, supply chain and business relationships. Initially performed in 2019 and informed by stakeholders, the HRIA uncovered key salient risk areas such as wages and working hours. In response, we expanded team member benefits, increased our starting wage rate and offered more flexible work options.\n\nOnce a refresh is complete, the HRIA will once again identify salient human rights risks relevant to Target, our team members, guests, supply chain workers and communities. Additionally, it will inform our human rights strategy moving forward, including the specific issues addressed in our Human Rights Statement.\n\nSalient human rights impact areas\n\n| Stakeholders          | Key salient risk aspects                                      |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Our team members      | \u2022 Safe working environments                                   |\n|                       | \u2022 Professional development                                     |\n|                       | \u2022 DE&I                                                          |\n| Our guests            | \u2022 Diverse and inclusive merchandise assortment and marketing promotions |\n| Workers in our supply chain | \u2022 No forced labor                                               |\n|                       | \u2022 Respecting human rights for all workers in our supply chain, specifically at-risk groups such as women, young workers and foreign contract workers |\n|                       | \u2022 Safe and healthy working environments, including access to clean water |\n| Our communities       | \u2022 Economic development                                          |\n|                       | \u2022 Diverse workforce and equitable hiring and development practices |\n\nCombating forced labor\n\nWe are committed to working with supply chain partners and industry experts to prevent, identify and eradicate forced labor in our global manufacturing supply chains.\n\nOur SOVE condemns and prohibits forced, trafficked or incarcerated labor in any supply chain activities.\n\nWe pay particular attention to, and perform additional due diligence around, indicators of forced labor in relation to higher-risk commodities (e.g., cotton and seafood) and higher-risk demographic groups such as foreign contract workers.\n\nPartnerships and collaborations\n\nAs well as identifying risks through our responsible sourcing audit process, we leverage partnerships with experts, including the following organizations:\n\n- **ELEVATE**: Supports sensitive case investigations and oversight within our Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability audit program.\n- **Impactt**: Aids ethical assessments, sensitive cases and issues related to our Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability audit program.\n- **Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment**: An Institute for Human Rights and Business initiative that supports the Employer Pays Principle. We have helped return significant sums to workers through our business partners by having them reimburse recruitment expenses, and continue to help workers avoid paying fees to secure jobs.\n- **The Responsible Labor Initiative**: A multi-stakeholder initiative that promotes the rights of workers vulnerable to forced labor.\n- **Stronger Together**: An organization committed to tackling modern slavery in supply chains.\n- **Verit\u00e9**: Our primary partner on in-depth foreign contract worker assessments at all factories that employ foreign contract workers.\n\nPreventing the use of underage labor\n\nOur SOVE explicitly details our zero tolerance policy for underage labor. Target is a member of The Centre for Child Rights and Business (CRIB) Working Group, which is advancing industry efforts to eliminate underage labor. We are working with CRIB on child labor prevention and remediation; when underage workers are identified, we collectively assess and address the noncompliance. We also provide long-term support to affected individuals to prevent a return to underage work.\n\nSince 2015, we have also worked with GoodWeave to combat underage labor in the Indian handwoven goods industry. GoodWeave-certified rugs are woven by adult artisans and help support education for thousands of at-risk children who might otherwise need to work. All owned brand rugs that are handwoven or tufted in India must be GoodWeave-certified.\nAbiding by conflict minerals rules\n\nOur conflict minerals compliance program is part of our overall effort to reduce the risk of human rights abuse in our supply chain. We encourage our vendors to use smelters and refiners that are certified as compliant with established conflict minerals standards.\n\nTarget supports the humanitarian goals of the conflict minerals rules, and annually conducts a country of origin inquiry covering all product categories for owned brands or exclusive brands that we believe could contain tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold (collectively known as \u201c3TG\u201d). In 2021, the product categories we surveyed included:\n\n- Apparel and Home Textiles.\n- Electronics, Lighting, Kitchenware and Small Appliances.\n- Home Improvement and Automotive.\n- Footwear and Luggage.\n- Accessories, Jewelry and Watches.\n- Furniture, Home D\u00e9cor, Bath and Seasonal Merchandise.\n- Lawn and Garden.\n- Health and Beauty Products.\n- Toys, Sporting Goods and Pet Supplies.\n- Paper, Office, Stationery and Scrapbooking.\n\nAs outlined in our Conflict Minerals Policy, Target will not knowingly purchase or sell any owned or exclusive brand product containing 3TG that finances armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and its adjoining regions. Our vendors must adopt a 3TG sourcing policy that is consistent with ours and with guidance from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). We also require that vendors report on the standard form developed by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI).\n\nTarget maintains the right to audit suppliers on responsible 3TG sourcing. In 2021, we surveyed 569 vendors of owned and exclusive brand products in categories that might contain 3TG, receiving responses from 100% of them. We encourage vendors to identify and source from smelters and refiners certified by the RMI as \u201cConformant.\u201d 215 of the 226 smelters and refiners identified by surveyed vendors that provided product-level information met this status.\n\nTarget could only determine the smelters and refiners that processed a portion of the 3TG contained in its potentially in-scope products. As such, while none of the necessary 3TG within in-scope products was determined to directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the DRC and its adjoining countries, we have not determined that any of our potentially in-scope products are \u201cDRC conflict free.\u201d\n\nAudits and continuous improvement\n\nBecause we believe in making a collective impact, we value common or shared audit programs, addressing issues that are too big for any one company to tackle alone through collaboration with others.\n\nOur Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability audit program covers all facilities that manufacture or convert raw materials into:\n\n- Target owned brand products and packaging.\n- Target exclusive products and packaging.\n- Target-distributed products and/or nationally branded products and packaging for which Target is the importer of record.\n\nOur risk-based audit program assesses facility conditions, worker treatment and compensation, hiring processes, environmental practices and compliance with applicable laws and Target\u2019s SOVE. All disclosed manufacturing locations must conduct regular audits and have them approved by our industry-aligned audit protocol. In 2020 and 2021, the coronavirus pandemic, travel and factory restrictions, and office closures related to COVID-19 decreased the ability for onsite audits to be conducted in many regions globally.\n\nReflective of the changing industry landscape, Target is further evolving its oversight approach to go beyond compliance, including implementing an industry-converged approach to assessment, and introducing more direct worker reporting channels and other real-time insights to understand emerging business and human rights risk. Target has also increased our disclosure requirements further back in the supply chain, including requirements about facility disclosure. Target maintains the right to conduct unannounced audits of any disclosed locations.\n\nIn 2021, our team delivered 17 training programs on this industry-converged approach to 3,155 internal team members and suppliers \u2014 more than 6,500 training hours in total. The feedback we received from suppliers is that, by accepting several audit programs, suppliers\u2019 facilities are more proactive in identifying root causes of issues and making improvements that benefit workers.\n\nLearn more about our auditing process and programs on our website.\n\nWe prioritize remediation and continuous improvement but, in some cases, noncompliant audits may result in the cancellation of purchase orders and the termination of business relationships. Target will not allow a vendor to use a previously noncompliant factory until the deactivation period has expired and the factory has demonstrated compliance with Target\u2019s SOVE and applicable laws.\n\nIn 2022, we rolled out our first human rights training to key business areas, including merchandising, owned brands, sourcing and corporate responsibility. The training covered an overview of business and human rights and Target\u2019s approach, including our human rights statement and business operations and supply chain due diligence efforts.\nIndexes and Glossary\nWe report on a range of environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics, in line with the criteria required by a number of leading international ESG reporting frameworks.\n\nThese standards inform our disclosures and reflect our commitment to giving investors and other stakeholders a detailed, transparent and holistic account of our approach, performance and progress. The responses in the following indexes include links to further information where relevant.\n\n**Scope**\n\nThis report \u2014 Target\u2019s 2022 ESG Report \u2014 was published in July 2022 and reflects activities and initiatives in our fiscal year (FY) 2021 (January 31, 2021 \u2013 January 29, 2022). It also covers certain subsequent events and initiatives that occurred after the end of FY2021 and prior to publication, which we have endeavored to note as such.\n\nAll quantitative goals and company data, unless otherwise stated, reflect FY2021. Unless noted, goals and other data in the report reflect our U.S. operations and/or owned brand portfolio, as relevant.\n\nOur last report, the 2021 Target Corporate Responsibility Report, was published in August 2021.\n\n**Report structure**\n\nHaving initially conducted an assessment in 2018\u20132019, we refreshed the analysis of our ESG priorities in 2021 to meet the expectations of our stakeholders, maintain business strategy, investments, internal and external engagements, and reporting centered around Target Forward and the most important ESG topics across our value chain. We worked with a third-party expert to examine a number of sources, including leading ESG frameworks, industry reports, peer benchmarking, and stakeholder data and insights. Some issues deemed priority for the purposes of this report are not considered material for U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting purposes.\n\nThis report has been written for a broad range of stakeholders, including but not limited to our team members, guests, suppliers, investors and nonprofits. To improve ease of use and comparability with peers, we index our reporting against frameworks from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework (UNGPRF), where applicable. Icons in relevant sections clearly indicate what reporting framework the content responds to.\n\nThroughout the report, policies that do not have links are references to Target\u2019s internal policies that are not publicly available.\n\n**Forward-looking statements**\n\nThis report contains forward-looking statements based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are typically accompanied by the words \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201cmight,\u201d \u201canticipates\u201d or similar words. The principal forward-looking statements in this report include:\n\n- Our sustainability goals, commitments and programs.\n- Our business plans, initiatives and objectives.\n- Our assumptions and expectations.\n- The scope and impact of ESG risks and opportunities.\n- Standards and expectations of third parties.\n\nAll such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be significantly different. The most important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth in our description of risk factors included in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2022, which should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nOur goals and commitments include specific achievements we seek to accomplish, and they have aspirational components that may take years or decades to achieve. Our goals and commitments may be based upon certain assumptions and circumstances that may shift or evolve over time, possibly affecting our achievements, goals and commitments.\n\nWe welcome your feedback on this report. For more information or to provide comments, please contact us at: CorporateResponsibility@Target.com.\nWe continue to report against the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, the most widely used framework for reporting on ESG issues. The report has been prepared with references to 2016 and 2018 GRI Standards.\n\n| GRI Standard | Disclosure Title | Disclosure Number | Target Response |\n|--------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| **General Disclosures** | | | |\n| **Organizational Profile** | | | |\n| GRI 102: General Disclosures 2016 | Name of the organization | 102-1 | Target Corporation 2021 Form 10-K: Cover |\n| | Activities, brands, products and services | 102-2 | 2021 Form 10-K: part I.

To meet this commitment, we have dedicated inclusivity training for all of our product designers, merchandising teams and marketing teams, in addition to processes for reviewing assortment decisions.\n\n**Our supply chain**\n\nWe are committed to respecting the human rights of workers within Target\u2019s supply chain, especially at-risk groups, including women, young workers and foreign contract workers. We expect all our domestic and international business partners to respect human rights, and to comply with Target\u2019s Standard of Vendor Engagement and all applicable laws pertaining to human rights including, without limitation, all laws applicable to workplace health, safety, labor and employment. Target\u2019s Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability audit program monitors worker safety and labor compliance in facilities that produce Target owned brand or exclusive products, as well as those that produce nationally branded products for which Target is the importer of record. We will do our part to validate that clean, drinkable water and sanitation are accessible for the workers in Target\u2019s supply chain. Target is a member of the ZDHC organization, and adopted its wastewater guidelines to help reduce unwanted chemicals in the manufacturing process for Target\u2019s products and to help prevent our suppliers from discharging hazardous wastewater into surrounding communities. We take a risk-based approach to supply chain management, and we continually assess and address the risks that emerge and evolve over time.\n\n**Our communities**\n\nWe believe in being good neighbors wherever we operate, focusing on creating opportunities for our teams, in addition to accelerating economic development and vitality, and helping power the prosperity and well-being of our communities. We are focused on nurturing a diverse workforce in the communities where we do business, with equitable access to hiring, development and advancement.\n\nOne of our greatest opportunities to foster communities is through our philanthropic efforts, as we give 5% of our profits back to the communities we call home, as we have since 1946.\n\n### Embedding respect\n\n| A2 | How does the company demonstrate the importance it attaches to the implementation of its human rights commitment? |\n|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|    | Promoting and protecting human rights p. 63-64 |\n|    | Human Rights Statement |\n|    | Supply Chain Labor & Human Rights Policies |\n|    | Code of Ethics |\n\nWe are conducting ongoing due diligence, as well as engaging with our stakeholders to better understand our salient human rights issues.

The murals draw inspiration from a poem by Target Associate Creative Director Shelby Lewis:\n\nWe will root our stories deeply.\nAs seeds of courage and change.\nWe will keep each other grounded.\nWith hope, resilience and strength.\nThere is healing here to grow from.\nOur renewal to stand as one.\nCommunity means everything.\nTogether is where we belong.\n\nI came to the U.S. from Guadalajara, Mexico, in the mid-2000s. The first store I stepped into in the U.S. was the Lake Street Target store to buy necessities. I even bought my first toy in the U.S. there. Years later, I came to Target to work as an art director, and creating a permanent mural for the exterior of this particular store is a full-circle moment for me.\n\nMy mural is inspired by the word \u201ctogether\u201d in Shelby\u2019s poem, and a lot of the visual representation is connected to my personal work and heritage as a Mexican. The butterflies represent all the immigrant communities that grew and established along the Lake Street corridor.\n\nThe biggest inspiration for the middle piece was seeing how neighbors showed up for each other after the Minneapolis protests.\n\nThere\u2019s so much value in showing up for others, especially in these hard times. And this community is filled with so much resilience. Over the years, I\u2019ve seen empty storefronts turn into thriving new businesses, and even as they navigate daily struggles, this community still sticks together.\u201d\n\nRead more about Target\u2019s Lake Street Minneapolis store and the local artist murals.", "source": "target_2021", "added": "2025-04-27", "created": "2025-04-27", "metadata": {"Source-File": "climate_reports/tp_reports/target_2021.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.1.59", "pdf-total-pages": 108, "total-input-tokens": 313534, "total-output-tokens": 85616, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 1180, 2], [1180, 5948, 3], [5948, 10563, 4], [10563, 14126, 5], [14126, 17380, 6], [17380, 21817, 7], [21817, 23960, 8], [23960, 29292, 9], [29292, 32697, 10], [32697, 35222, 11], [35222, 35331, 12], [35331, 37365, 13], [37365, 40492, 14], [40492, 44198, 15], [44198, 46903, 16], [46903, 52071, 17], [52071, 54514, 18], [54514, 56135, 19], [56135, 60168, 20], [60168, 64901, 21], [64901, 70338, 22], [70338, 75013, 23], [75013, 77738, 24], [77738, 82248, 25], [82248, 84388, 26], [84388, 88650, 27], [88650, 94173, 28], [94173, 98252, 29], [98252, 102616, 30], [102616, 102802, 31], [102802, 104481, 32], [104481, 107069, 33], [107069, 108479, 34], [108479, 112516, 35], [112516, 116702, 36], [116702, 121107, 37], [121107, 124065, 38], [124065, 127476, 39], [127476, 131615, 40], [131615, 133531, 41], [133531, 136167, 42], [136167, 139535, 43], [139535, 142092, 44], [142092, 145198, 45], [145198, 150299, 46], [150299, 154412, 47], [154412, 158516, 48], [158516, 162978, 49], [162978, 166109, 50], [166109, 170670, 51], [170670, 175819, 52], [175819, 175830, 53], [175830, 177013, 54], [177013, 178671, 55], [178671, 181129, 56], [181129, 185825, 57], [185825, 190166, 58], [190166, 192496, 59], [192496, 197847, 60], [197847, 200960, 61], [200960, 204495, 62], [204495, 209807, 63], [209807, 215041, 64], [215041, 215062, 65], [215062, 219554, 66], [219554, 222289, 67], [222289, 224750, 68], [224750, 227763, 69], [227763, 230198, 70], [230198, 232770, 71], [232770, 233936, 72], [233936, 236208, 73], [236208, 238414, 74], [238414, 241239, 75], [241239, 242659, 76], [242659, 244992, 77], [244992, 247125, 78], [247125, 249160, 79], [249160, 251763, 80], [251763, 253678, 81], [253678, 256470, 82], [256470, 258846, 83], [258846, 262103, 84], [262103, 264540, 85], [264540, 273544, 86], [273544, 276438, 87], [276438, 280073, 88], [280073, 286605, 89], [286605, 291269, 90], [291269, 295437, 91], [295437, 300227, 92], [300227, 304337, 93], [304337, 308778, 94], [308778, 313295, 95], [313295, 316015, 96], [316015, 318638, 97], [318638, 320342, 98], [320342, 322433, 99], [322433, 328173, 100], [328173, 331861, 101], [331861, 336454, 102], [336454, 339079, 103], [339079, 341579, 104], [341579, 349348, 105], [349348, 357181, 106], [357181, 360922, 107], [360922, 362646, 108]]}}
