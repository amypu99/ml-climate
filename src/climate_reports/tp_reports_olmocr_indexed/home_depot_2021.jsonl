Prior to becoming CEO, I had the privilege to work in multiple departments across the organization. One thing that has always been clear to me is that our values-driven culture and passion for our customers has been instrumental to our success.\n\nBuilt around our core values, our approach to ESG centers around three key pillars \u2013 Focus on Our People, Operate Sustainably, and Strengthen Our Communities. By identifying these three pillars, we can concentrate on the areas where we can have the greatest impact. Our 2022 ESG Report details the daily work we do to support these three pillars, as well as the progress we made in 2021 thanks to the dedication and ingenuity of our associates and suppliers.\n\nOur focus on people centers around continuously striving to create a work environment that is inclusive, engaging, and rewarding to associates. Our associates\u2019 outstanding performance in 2021 enabled 100% of our stores to qualify for Success Sharing bonus payments to non-management associates. We also offer training and development that transforms jobs into careers, which is reflected in the fact that approximately 90% of our U.S. store leaders began as hourly associates.\n\nOur U.S. workforce is more ethnically diverse than the U.S. working population. In addition, we increased the representation of female and underrepresented minority groups across our managers and above cohort in the U.S. during 2021.\n\nWe believe our associates should reflect the customers and communities we serve. In 2021, approximately 36% of our U.S. new hires were women, while more than 57% of U.S. new hires were from an underrepresented minority group.\n\nOur commitment to diversity also extends to our supplier relationships. In 2021, we increased our spend with diverse suppliers to $3.3 billion and have announced a goal to achieve $5 billion in direct annual spend with diverse suppliers by 2025. We also completed our goal to launch a Tier II supplier diversity program to encourage our suppliers to spend with diverse businesses. We will continue to push forward in this area by partnering with organizations like the Billion Dollar Roundtable, an association geared at celebrating corporations that spend at least $1 billion per year with minority- and woman-owned suppliers, to further amplify our supplier diversity efforts.\n\nOur efforts to operate sustainably begin with our understanding that our biggest impact on the environment comes from the products we sell. Our partnership with suppliers allows us to give our customers access to hundreds of products that are good for their homes, good for the environment, and good for their wallets. In 2021, we estimate our customers\u2019 purchases of Energy Star products helped reduce annual electricity use by 7 billion kilowatt hours, saving $950 million on energy costs, and lowering carbon emissions by 4.9 million metric tons. Our water-saving products allowed customers to reduce consumption by over 66 billion gallons.\n\n\u201cBuilt around our core values, our approach to ESG centers around three key pillars \u2013 Focus on Our People, Operate Sustainably, and Strengthen Our Communities. By identifying these three pillars, we can concentrate on the areas where we can have the greatest impact.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Ted Decker, CEO and president of The Home Depot\n\nContinues on next page\nWe also made progress in 2021 by operating more sustainably in our own business, reducing electricity consumption in our U.S. stores by approximately 11% year-over-year. We cut U.S. store electricity usage a remarkable 50% since 2010. A hallmark of progress in this area has been the transition to LED overhead lighting in our U.S. stores, which join our Canada and Mexico stores in having nearly all of interior lighting powered by LED bulbs. While we remain focused on reducing our energy consumption, we are also making progress towards our goal of producing or procuring 100% renewable electricity equivalent to the electricity needs for all Home Depot facilities worldwide by 2030.\n\nWe focus on strengthening our communities by giving back financially and through our associates\u2019 time and efforts dedicated to Team Depot volunteer activities \u2013 a hallmark of who we are. In 2021, approximately 14,000 associates volunteered in communities across 150 cities nationwide. Our Team Depot volunteers helped our communities prepare and respond to natural disasters like tornados, hurricanes, and wildfires, while also achieving more than 1.25 million hours of service to veterans since 2011.\n\nWe also value our nonprofit partners that enable The Home Depot Foundation to improve the homes and lives of U.S. veterans, train skilled tradespeople to fill the labor gap, and support communities affected by natural disasters.\n\nIn 2021, the Foundation achieved a milestone of ten years and over $400 million invested in support of veteran causes, on track to contribute half of a billion dollars to veteran causes by 2025.\n\nWhile we have made significant progress, there is more work to do. On Pages 9 and 10 of this report, you will see the goals we\u2019ve set as we strive to build a better and more sustainable business.\n\n\u201cWe know that when we invest in running a responsible, sustainable company, we make our business stronger, more agile, and more resilient.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Ted Decker, CEO and president of The Home Depot\nENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS & SETTING PRIORITIES\n\nWe value seeing ESG impact and opportunities through our operational lens and also through the lenses of our stakeholders.\n\nAs the largest home improvement retailer in the world, we have the unique opportunity to create positive impacts across a broad number of stakeholders. We have also been reminded over the last two years how quickly our world can change, which is why we continue our practice of proactive engagement and provide numerous channels for feedback, so we can remain attentive to the concerns and needs of our stakeholders.\n\nWe have learned over the years that one of the best ways for us to make sure we understand the relevant environmental, social and governance (ESG) impacts of our business and the current areas of focus of our many stakeholders is to engage with our stakeholders. This engagement comes through multiple channels.\n\nWe receive constant feedback from our customers through the more than a billion and a half transactions across our stores and digital channels annually.\n\nWe survey our approximately 500,000 associates to measure how emotionally connected they are to their work. We collaborate with our vendors and suppliers in an effort to lessen the environmental impact of the products we sell. Individuals and organizations from around the globe reach out to us with questions or concerns about our operations or products. We meet with shareholders and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) interested in our business practices. We take part in industry efforts to raise awareness about the ESG responsibilities we all share.\n\nOur ongoing interactions may be formal or informal, as detailed in our ESG Priority Assessment Framework on Page 7. These interactions help validate our own priority assessment; they also help us gauge the impact of our business, refine ESG priorities, measure our progress and design ways to improve.\n\nBy better understanding our impact and collaborating with stakeholders, we position our company to set objectives that allow us to contribute to building a better business, workplace and world.\n\nOur Sustainability Council, composed of representatives from different areas of the business, oversees our approach to sustainability. Members of the Council share stakeholder feedback from their functional areas. The Council focuses on several key areas, as shown below.\n\nThe Council meets twice a year, and its chair presents our sustainability strategy and activities to the Board of Directors annually. We also provide quarterly updates to our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regarding our ESG engagement. Our ESG priorities and plans are communicated internally and externally via various channels, including in this annual report.\nStakeholders share their perspectives on our ESG practices. Their input helps shape our strategy.\n\n**Associates**\n\u201cEmpower us to be contributing team members of a values-based organization.\u201d\n\n**Customers**\n\u201cBe a global-impact conscious company, and provide products that help me reduce my home\u2019s environmental impact.\u201d\n\n**Academia**\n\u201cGive us insight into customer trends and habits to aid our

Here he offers insights into our progress.\n\nWho drives ESG at The Home Depot?\n\nMany associates and business leaders throughout our enterprise! They take pride in improving their departments and businesses in multiple ESG aspects. Our leadership understands that an effective environmental, social and governance strategy cannot happen in isolation. It is not the sole responsibility of a corporate ESG team. Rather, our ESG strategy must reflect The Home Depot\u2019s core values, and it must be embedded in all aspects of how we run our business. Everybody owns it.\n\nHow have associates helped drive ESG progress at The Home Depot?\n\nOne of our eight core values is Do The Right Thing, which drives our associates to find new ways that our organization can reduce its environmental impact.\n\nThis can be seen through our packaging team who looks for ways to reduce the package footprints and ways to use more sustainable materials for our private-label products (see Page 55).\n\nAnother example are our associates who work to find ways to upcycle the packaging waste in our stores and supply chain into new products like Trex composite decking.\n\nHow is The Home Depot helping customers increase the sustainability of their homes and businesses?\n\nOur Eco Actions program, which builds on our original Eco Options program that we launched in 2007, helps our customers take on more sustainable DIY projects and choose greener products that can save water, conserve energy or are formulated to reduce certain chemicals. Products can only qualify for this distinction if manufacturers provide third-party verification of environmental claims that meet our program\u2019s requirements. This program also offers customers green project ideas and tips, for example, how to grow an organic garden (see Page 50).\n\nIn addition, we encourage our customers to drop off used compact fluorescent light bulbs and rechargeable batteries for recycling. In 2021, we collected 1,162,800 pounds of recycled batteries, a 24% increase since 2014 (see Page 54).\n\nWe also help our customers go greener in ways that may be less apparent to them. For example, we offer circularity-centered products like our Home Depot-branded moving boxes, made from 100% post-consumer recycled paper fiber (see Page 45), as well as composite deck boards made from recycled plastic waste from our stores. We continue to make progress on our goal to exclude expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) film from our private-brand product packaging by the end of 2023. When customers rent tools from us, they help avoid the environmental impact of new product manufacturing. Another example: Our stores have cut electricity consumption 50% since 2010, providing our customers a lower energy intensive shopping environment.\n\nIs sustainability a competitive advantage for The Home Depot?\n\nOverall, we believe good business decisions drive sustainability. Examples of this can be seen through the investments we\u2019ve made to create the most efficient supply chain in home improvement. These investments have helped us reduce the number of trucks needed and distance traveled to get our products from our supplier to our customers, while also reducing fuel emissions. Another example of this is our store investments, part of which included transitioning stores to LED lighting, which helped us reduce operating costs and electricity consumption.\n\nWe also believe that by working with our suppliers to bring innovative and sustainable products to market, we help our customers create more sustainable homes and workplaces. Our efforts to drive innovation can be seen in every aisle of the store, and we believe this is a key differentiator in the market.\n\nWe also want to see sustainability be the norm for our entire industry. We are encouraged when we see other retailers take big swings and do innovative things that push all of us to do a better job of protecting the planet, and we hope the innovation that we bring through our operations and products motivates others to do the same.\n\n- Ron Jarvis\nChief Sustainability Officer\n2021 HIGHLIGHTS\n\nOur core values guide how we focus on our people, operate sustainably and strengthen our communities and provide a benchmark for measuring progress.

We believe our approximately 500,000 associates are our greatest asset, and they differentiate us in the marketplace.\n\nInvest more than 1 million hours per year through 2022 in training and development to help our front-line associates grow their careers.\n\nCreate enhanced career opportunities for 50,000 front-line associates over a five-year period ending in 2023.\n\nBy the end of 2021, expand associate resource groups to include more associates and increase engagement and participation.\nDIVERSITY, EQUITY & INCLUSION\n\nWe strive to create an environment centered around our eight core values, where diversity, equity and inclusion fuel opportunities for our associates, communities, and suppliers.\n\nWhile our office of Diversity & Inclusion has existed within the company for more than a decade to help diversify our workforce and support change in our communities, we expanded in 2020 and renamed it to fit an enhanced mission: Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI). Adding equity to our focus reflects our desire to promote fairness, remove bias and ensure all of our associates and business partners have access to the resources they need to succeed at work.\n\nIn 2021, we met our goal to expand our associate resource groups (ARGs) beyond our Store Support Center (corporate facility) to include more associates and increase engagement and participation. Through our new associate engagement platform, Yammer, all our U.S. associates are now able to access our ARGs. We also leveraged Yammer to reach more associates with C.A.R.E. talks, a series of diversity discussions that Champion Awareness, Respect, and Equity for all associates. Learn more here: Page 26.\n\nWe were also able to meet our goal to launch a Tier II supplier diversity program in 2021. Beyond the $3.3 billion we spent with diverse Tier I (direct) suppliers last year, our new program will help us measure and encourage our Tier I suppliers to spend more with diverse businesses. Find out more about our supplier diversity efforts on Page 60.\n\nAt The Home Depot, we define diversity, equity and inclusion as:\n\nDiversity: Composition of people, such as their similarities and differences (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation)\n\nEquity: Norms, practices and policies in place that ensure just and fair opportunities and outcomes, allowing individuals to reach their full potential\n\nInclusion: How we embrace and enable our associates to feel safe, respected, engaged, motivated and valued for who they are and their contributions\n\nLearn more about how we work with our community partners across the nation and how spending with diverse suppliers benefits our company and our communities on Pages 58-61.\n\nKEY AREAS OF FOCUS\n\nAt The Home Depot, we focus on three key areas to create meaningful change through thoughtful actions that align with all eight of our core values.\n\nASSOCIATE ENGAGEMENT\n\n\u2022 Increasing diverse representation throughout our organization\n\u2022 Creating an environment where every associate feels included and valued for who they are\n\u2022 Promoting equal opportunity in recruitment, hiring, training, development and advancement\n\nCOMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS\n\n\u2022 Striving to close the wealth gap\n\u2022 Advancing education for all\n\nSUPPLIER DIVERSITY\n\n\u2022 Increasing our penetration and spend with diverse suppliers\n\u2022 Developing diverse suppliers by providing mentorship and shared resources\n\nWe have many initiatives currently in the works, including an expansion of our existing Retool Your School program to further strengthen our commitment to historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). This expansion, set to launch in 2023, will include more programming and a broader reach (See Page 62).\n\nIn addition, we are working to enlarge our network of external partner organizations to enhance the career development of our female, minority, LGBTQ+ and veteran associates.\n\nCHECK IT OUT\n\nWhen Khareem Mitchell started with The Home Depot in 2018, he discovered a workplace where his personal principles aligned with company values. His Afro-Hispanic roots play a big role in how he conducts his life \u2014 both inside and outside of work.\nDOING THE RIGHT THING\n\nDerek Bottoms, chief diversity officer and vice president of associate relations, explains how diversity, equity and inclusion align with our company values.\n\nWhat does diversity, equity and inclusion mean at The Home Depot?\n\nAt The Home Depot, our values guide us on everything we do. They serve as our foundation, and they are embedded in our culture. Our expanded focus on diversity, equity and inclusion supports all eight of our core values, including respect for all people, giving back and building strong relationships with other associates and our customers. We strive to build a workplace and retail space that reflect the communities we serve. A diverse and inclusive workplace also creates shareholder value by providing different perspectives and fresh ideas that spark innovation.\n\nWhat are some ways The Home Depot is driving progress for its stakeholders?\n\nWe recently expanded our associate resource groups (ARGs) to all associates companywide, including in stores and distribution centers. Previously, these groups were only available to our Store Support Center (SSC) associates. (Go to Page 26 to learn more.) In an aligned effort, we are identifying tools and platforms to directly engage with our hourly front-line associates to share DEI-related information and resources.\n\nWe also are raising awareness of DEI and its importance by modernizing our learning materials; holding listening sessions where executives hear from associates across the organization; and focusing on recruiting and talent-planning strategies that emphasize diversity and inclusion.\n\nOn the community side, we are continuing to partner with local and national organizations focused on closing the wealth gap and advancing education for all. We continue to amplify our supplier diversity efforts to drive innovation, economic opportunities and shareholder value by directing more of our dollars, directly and indirectly, toward diverse businesses. We look to partner with organizations like the Billion Dollar Roundtable whose mission aligns with our focus areas. To further our commitment to supplier diversity, we are also seeking to achieve $5 billion in direct annual spend with diverse suppliers by 2025. See Page 60 to learn more about our supplier diversity efforts.\n\nWhat project excites you?\n\nI\u2019m excited about our plans to expand Our Retool Your School program in 2023, which has provided campus beautification funding to historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) since 2009. By expanding the reach of this program, we can further strengthen our commitment to HBCUs and their students, including through career development opportunities. (Learn more on Page 62).\n\nMission Statement\n\nThe Home Depot ignites the doer in all of us to build a culture of understanding, acceptance and appreciation.\n\nVision Statement\n\nThe Home Depot is building a more diverse, equitable and inclusive organization, within our enterprise and the communities we are proud to serve. Grounded in our core values, we have the conviction, capabilities and tools to make a difference for our associates, community partners and suppliers.\nBUILDING A DIVERSE WORKFORCE\n\nOur diverse workforce strengthens our competitive advantages and reflects the customers and communities we serve. A comparison against U.S. Department of Labor data shows that our U.S. workforce is more ethnically diverse than the nation\u2019s working population. In 2021, we also expanded the number and percentage of women and minorities at the manager level and above. These charts reflect the demographics of The Home Depot\u2019s U.S. workforce from fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2021. Certain percentages may not sum to 100% due to rounding or, in 2020 and 2021, some associates choosing not to self-identify by race/ethnicity or gender. 2019 percentages included these non-disclosing associates in the white or male categories, as applicable.\n\nU.S. WORKING POPULATION\n\n| Year | White | Underrepresented Minority Groups |\n|------|-------|----------------------------------|\n| 2021 | 63%   | 37%                              |\n| 2020 | 64%   | 36%                              |\n| 2019 | 61%   | 39%                              |\n\nTHD U.S. WORKFORCE*\n\n| Year | White | Underrepresented Minority Groups |\n|------|-------|----------------------------------|\n| 2021 | 50%   | 48%                              |\n| 2020 | 52%   | 47%                              |\n| 2019 | 54%   | 46%                              |\n\n| Year | Male | Female |\n|------|------|--------|\n| 2021 | 53%  | 47%    |\n| 2020 | 53%  | 47%    |\n| 2019 | 53%  | 47%    |\n\nSource: Latest available data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics; 2021 data is estimated\n\nTHD U.S. WORKFORCE BY RACE/ETHNICITY\n\n2021\n\n- 50.0% White\n- 22.3% Hispanic\n- 17.9% Black\n- 3.1% Asian\n- 4.9% Other\n- 1.7% Undisclosed\n\n2020\n\n- 51.5% White\n- 21.8% Hispanic\n- 17.0% Black\n- 2.9% Asian\n- 5.0% Other\n- 1.7% Undisclosed\n\n2019\n\n- 53.7% White\n- 20.0% Hispanic\n- 16.5% Black\n- 2.9% Asian\n- 4.9% Other\n- 2.0% Undisclosed\n\n*The 2020 and 2021 results include data for HD Supply Holdings Inc.\nU.S. MANAGERS AND ABOVE* (EXCLUDES OFFICER LEVEL)\n\n| Year | Male | Female |\n|------|------|--------|\n| 2021 | 65%  | 34%    |\n| 2020 | 68%  | 32%    |\n| 2019 | 68%  | 32%    |\n\nTotal Number of U.S. Managers and Above:\n- 2021: 24,600\n- 2020: 19,100\n- 2019: 18,100\n\nU.S. MANAGERS AND ABOVE* BY RACE/ETHNICITY\n\n- **2021**\n  - 61.7% White\n  - 15.3% Hispanic\n  - 13.9% Black\n  - 3.7% Asian\n  - 4.6% Other\n  - 0.8% Undisclosed\n\n- **2020**\n  - 63.7% White\n  - 13.5% Hispanic\n  - 12.9% Black\n  - 4.8% Asian\n  - 4.2% Other\n  - 0.9% Undisclosed\n\n- **2019**\n  - 64.8% White\n  - 13.3% Hispanic\n  - 12.4% Black\n  - 4.5% Asian\n  - 4.2% Other\n  - 0.9% Undisclosed\n\n*Includes manager-level positions and above at stores, distribution centers and other field locations, as well as at our Store Support Center; excludes officers.

It is vital to The Home Depot\u2019s culture and success.\n\nVoice of the Associate Survey\nHighly engaged associates care about their work and the performance of The Home Depot. Our passion is to create an engaging and inclusive workplace; we do so by proactively engaging with our associates, while also listening and responding to their feedback.\n\nIn 2021, we introduced an additional Voice of the Associate survey to all our associates. Our two Voice of the Associate surveys \u2013 Census and Pulse \u2013 provided us the opportunity to hear from our associates at least twice in 2021. Our Census survey is an annual in-depth look at our associate\u2019s engagement and satisfaction with their job and with the Home Depot, while our Pulse survey is typically shorter and seeks feedback on specific topics. Based on the Voice of the Associate 2021 Census survey, we saw the highest engagement numbers across the enterprise that we have seen in the past few years.\n\nIn addition, we also added two additional surveys \u2013 Onboarding and Exit, into our \u201cLifecycle Listening\u201d toolbelt. These additional surveys allow us to intentionally connect with associates at specific moments within their career at The Home Depot.\n\nEngagement Platform\nIn 2021, our new associate engagement platform - Yammer, which was launched at the end of fiscal 2020 - helped create new collaboration spaces and opportunities for reaching associates across the business.\n\nWhether through on-site desktops or on-the-go mobile devices, more than 450,000 associates across the U.S. and Canada have access to Yammer. With more than 650 active communities in the network, the digital hub links associates to both their local co-workers and corporate support across North America. It serves as a central hub to recognize associates for living our values, promote company news, cultivate connections between front-line and corporate associates and fuel the orange-blooded entrepreneurial spirit that\u2019s part of what drives our business every day.\n\nSuccess Sharing and Compensation Enhancements\nOur philosophy of taking care of our people and motivating them to deliver a superior customer experience shapes our profit-sharing program for hourly associates. Success Sharing provides semi-annual cash awards for performance against our business plan, including sales and productivity goals. The program has granted awards totaling more than $1 billion to associates over the last two years.\n\nThe outstanding performance of our associates in fiscal 2021 enabled 100% of stores to qualify for Success Sharing in both the first and second half of the year. This resulted in record award payments to our non-management associates of approximately $739 million.\n\nWe also continue to make investments in our associates \u2013 recent actions include our decision at the end of 2020 to transition our COVID-related enhanced associate pay and benefits to permanent compensation enhancements for front-line, hourly associates. In addition, we continued matching contributions under our FutureBuilder 401(k) Plan, and merit-based salary increases.\n\nOur People: Pay Equity\nThe Home Depot\u2019s commitment to doing the right thing and taking care of our people extends to our pay practices. To ensure that we are paying our associates fairly, we conduct an annual analysis of our pay and compensation practices for our U.S. associates (who comprise approximately 89% of our workforce), in consultation with expert third-party firms following industry-leading standards. Our review of our U.S. associates\u2019 total W-2 compensation for calendar year 2021, including base pay, cash bonuses, and stock, showed that, adjusting for relevant factors such as tenure, position, location and hours worked, associates who identified as female earned approximately 101% of what male associates earned, and associates who identified as members of a racial or ethnic minority earned approximately 99% of what non-minority associates earned. Not adjusting for those factors, our analysis showed that the median annualized W-2 pay for U.S. associates who identified as female was 98% of the median for men, and that the median pay for racial/ethnic minority associates in the U.S. was 94% of the median for non-minority associates. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which is tasked with providing oversight of our human capital management strategy and our diversity and inclusion efforts, receives regular updates on these findings. We will continue to strive to ensure equal pay across our organization.\n\nDID YOU KNOW\nIn 2021, Home Depot\u2019s Yammer network was recognized as the #1 Yammer network among large organizations in the Americas by SWOOP Analytics.\nASSOCIATE RESOURCE GROUPS\n\nOur associate resource groups promote inclusion and support diversity.\n\nOur associate resource groups (ARGs) are led by associates and sponsored by executive leaders. They drive associate engagement and promote inclusion across our company through fostering professional development, raising cultural awareness, celebrating diversity, and community outreach.\n\nWe have seven U.S. ARGs, each supporting the company\u2019s business objectives and policies, particularly those related to developing our associates, creating diversity awareness and engaging diverse community partners.\n\nIn 2021, we revised our ARG structure to further support the career development of associates who voluntarily lead these groups. We also achieved our goal of expanding associate resource groups to include more of our people. We hosted more than 70 ARG events virtually in 2021 to celebrate diversity, raise cultural awareness and foster professional development. We continue to expand outreach to associates to encourage their engagement in our ARGs.\n\nDID YOU KNOW\nThe Home Depot was named to Forbes\u2019 list of Best Employers for Diversity in 2019, 2021 and 2022.\n\nSPOTLIGHT: C.A.R.E. TALKS\n\nWe launched Caring Conversations in 2020 in response to the unrest in our community. The virtual events for all associates included panel discussions where senior company leaders shared candid stories about race and ethnicity, and experts from outside our company educated associates about civil rights, laws, voting and more. In 2021, Caring Conversations evolved into C.A.R.E. Talks, a series of diversity discussions that Champion Awareness, Respect, and Equity for all associates. These discussions include external speaker series, panel discussions, and small group listening sessions, and we occasionally partnered with our Associate Resource Groups on elevating keynote speakers in this format. At the enterprise level, we hosted 13 C.A.R.E. Talks in 2021. These diversity discussions will be expanded to include additional formats in 2022.\n\nComments from Associate Feedback Survey:\n\nSupplier Diversity Panel: \u201cThe impact HD and many of its suppliers have on making their associates have better lives is inspiring and heartfelt. Love working for and with folks that care. Pun intended.\u201d\n\nHBCU Panel: \u201cThe alignment between THD\u2019s values and the values instilled in students attending HBCUs resonated with me. As an HBCU alum, my experience was similar to the panelists\u2019 experiences, i.e. earning a values-based education in addition to the academics.\u201d\n\nKen\u2019s Krew Program: \u201cThe sheer pride that poured out of that young man and his mother literally made my day. We take for granted sometimes the roles we have and this was a nice reminder.\u201d (Learn more on Page 59)\nLEARNING & DEVELOPMENT\n\nOur learning and development programs expand skills and capabilities so associates can master their current roles and prepare for future ones.\n\nThe Home Depot strives to build a learning-rich workplace where associates and leaders are prepared to succeed, motivated to serve our customers well and given opportunities to grow.

Supporting them is the right thing to do for our communities and our company.\n\nHonoring those who serve or who have served us is fundamental to our ESG pillar of Strengthening our Communities. Our focus on the military community and their families includes the tens of thousands of veterans and military spouses in our workforce. Through our recently expanded Military Relations department, we look for ways to make The Home Depot an employer of choice for military members, veterans and their families.\n\nOne of those veterans is Pete Capel, who has created a 30+ year career with The Home Depot. Like his father who served in the Navy during WWII, Pete joined the Marine Corps in 1983. During his 7-year military career maintaining radar systems, he was promoted to the rank of sergeant and was awarded the Navy Achievement Medal twice, an award that recognizes outstanding achievement or meritorious service and is recognized across all military branches.\n\nAfter Pete left the Marine Corps in 1990, he began to think about what was next in his life. That\u2019s when his story with The Home Depot started in the most unlikely of ways.\n\nPete was getting his hair cut when Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank, Home Depot co-founders, appeared on TV. As they were talking about how the company got started, Pete looked up and saw that there was a Home Depot store across the street. After his appointment ended, Pete walked over and immediately applied for a job.\n\nPete was originally employed as a store sales associate in the electrical department. Since then, he\u2019s held positions of increasing responsibility over his 30-year career. Today, he\u2019s the vice president of field merchandising for the northern, southern, and western divisions.\n\nJust as Pete did more than 30 years ago, Richard Cranford and Aminah Meho recently left careers in the Army and Air Force, respectively, and found new opportunities with The Home Depot. Through programs like Hiring our Heroes, The Home Depot partners with organizations that support military members who are transitioning into a second career and can help veterans find a role they enjoy.\n\nMade-to-Fit Benefits\n\nThe Home Depot offers specialized benefits for veterans, military service members and military spouses who are Home Depot associates:\n\n- Military leave of absence for reservists, National Guard, and active-duty associates\n- Differential pay when activated or deployed\n- Fellowships for transitioning service members\n- Military family international leave of absence\n- Military Spouse Relocation program for hourly associates\n- Over 5,000 remote eligible jobs that can be relocated with military moves\n- Support resources, such as counselors, financial advisers and childcare assistance directories\n\nCHECK IT OUT\n\nThe Home Depot supports associates who are spouses of military members with flexible hours to help address the unique challenges the military might bring. Hear from military spouse and 6-year associate Alexis (Lexi) Strom on how The Home Depot\u2019s flexible hours helped her balance family responsibilities during the pandemic.\n\nDID YOU KNOW\n\nThe Home Depot recently enhanced its military discount benefit to include all U.S. veterans, active service members and military spouses every day, reaffirming the company\u2019s commitment to serving the U.S. military community nationwide.

Every dollar our people donate helps a co-worker in need.\n\nThe Homer Fund provides financial assistance to associates facing unexpected hardships, helps associates\u2019 children pay for college and supports our people with financial information to help them prepare for emergencies.\n\nGrant Programs\n\n- **Direct Grants** help associates facing emergencies and tragic events, such as the death of a parent or child, natural disaster, illness or injury, a spouse\u2019s layoff and more, up to $10,000.\n\n- **Matching Grants** are a unique way The Homer Fund recognizes the generosity of associates toward one another. When associates collect donations for a co-worker in need, their money is matched by The Homer Fund \u2014 $2 for every $1 associates collect, up to $5,000 or the associate\u2019s actual need. Matching Grants may be used for qualifying expenses that are ineligible for Direct Grants. They also may be used to complement Direct Grants, providing additional support to associates in need.\n\nScholarships for Associates\u2019 Children\n\nThe Homer Fund\u2019s Orange Scholars program offers scholarships to qualified children or dependents of hourly associates based on financial need, academic performance, community involvement and leadership. Financial need is the highest consideration. Since the Orange Scholars launch in 2006, the program has awarded scholarships to more than 15,000 recipients, totaling $36 million.\n\nFinancial Preparation\n\nIn addition to our grant and scholarship programs, we provide associates with access to a range of Homer Fund-backed resources to support their financial well-being and decision making, including how to save for emergencies and protect themselves against fraud.\n\nHighlights\n\nIn 2021, The Homer Fund continued to support our people in times of need:\n\n- Nearly $18.8 million was awarded through Homer Fund grants\n- 12 consecutive months of grant distributions related to natural disasters helped associates cope with a variety of challenges\n- 8,800+ associates received financial assistance linked to the pandemic, hurricanes, wildfires and more\n- Associate financial assistance included 358 grants totaling $1.2 million related to COVID-19 hardships, and 2,920 grants totaling $2.7 million for disaster recovery\n\nSince 1999, The Homer Fund grants totaling approximately $230 million have assisted approximately 164,000 associates facing unexpected hardships.\nASSOCIATE SAFETY\n\nOur people are our most important assets. By focusing on workplace safety training and risk reduction, we help keep our associates and customers injury-free.\n\nThe Home Depot strives to provide the safest working and shopping environment for our associates and customers. A major component in the strategy is raising awareness of risks among both frontline associates and leaders. When our people are trained to recognize and correct hazards, our workplace is primed for continual improvement.\n\nSafety Takes EveryONE\n\nIn 2021 we launched an awareness campaign called Safety Takes EveryONE. This message exemplifies that everyone, at all levels of the organization, must contribute to the safety of our associates and customers.\n\nAt the individual level of the campaign, each associate is provided tools to avoid risk, with every decision made, resulting in everyday safety. Safety Takes EveryONE is our rally cry to remind associates that safety is their most important responsibility and allows us to send everyone home safely.\n\nThe leader approach to Safety Takes EveryONE utilizes the acronym ONE. This second arm of the campaign focuses on our leaders\u2019 efforts to increase awareness of the higher-risk injury categories.\n\nThe N is for New Hire\n\nOur focus is to ensure our newest associates are set up for safety success. Starting with their initial onboarding, we have simplified and prioritized safety training earlier in an associate\u2019s experience to raise awareness around the riskiest tasks. We reinforce our onboarding program with monthly awareness topics and leader-driven engagements during the first six months of employment to allow associates to ask questions and provide feedback to improve safety. Safety Takes EveryONE requires leaders to engage with their associates early in their career to establish a positive safety culture.\n\nThe E is for Equipment\n\nEquipment is essential to all areas of our business and it is paramount that it is operated in a safe manner. Safety Takes EveryONE requires leaders to interact with associates through safety engagements focusing on the safe operations of both the driver and the associates working around the equipment. The results of these engagements are reviewed and shared with leaders to create a continuous improvement model. This heightened awareness drives innovation that will remove risk from our business and improve the safety within our stores and facilities.\n\nSafety is not one person\u2019s responsibility, Safety Takes EveryONE to create an environment that fosters feedback, empowers our associates and leaders to make the safest decision, and allows every associate and customer to go home safely to their loved ones every day.\n\nRECORDABLE INCIDENT RATE\n(per 200,000 hours)*\n\n| Year | Rate |\n|------|------|\n| 2019 | 4.89 |\n| 2020 | 4.03 |\n| 2021 | 4.25 |\n\nLOST TIME INCIDENT RATE\n(per 200,000 hours)*\n\n| Year | Rate |\n|------|------|\n| 2019 | 1.21 |\n| 2020 | 1.07 |\n| 2021 | 1.23 |\n\nDID YOU KNOW\n\nThe Home Depot\u2019s lost time incident rate was lower than industry averages for our retail class, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n*Recordable and lost time incident rates for U.S. store associates.\nOPERATE SUSTAINABLY\n\nRESOURCES\n\n- Greenhouse Gas Protocol\n- Responsible Sourcing\n- Wood Purchasing Policy\n- Forest Stewardship Council\n- U.N.

We partner with suppliers focused on social and environmental responsibility, and we help our customers reduce their environmental impact by offering products and packaging created with sustainability in mind.\n\n- Procure/produce 100% renewable electricity equivalent to the needs for all Home Depot facilities worldwide by 2030\n- Procure/produce 335 megawatts of renewable or alternative energy by 2025\n- Science-based target to reduce Scope 1 & 2 emissions 40% by 2030, 50% by 2035\n- Eliminate EPS foam & PVC film from our private-brand packaging by 2023\nPROTECTING THE CLIMATE\n\nCARBON FOOTPRINT\n\nBy driving efficiencies and investing in green energy, we reduced our absolute combined Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by approximately 172,000 metric tons in 2021.\n\nThe Home Depot uses the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, which has been adopted by numerous companies worldwide to calculate metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions and efforts to reduce them. We continually review and refine our emissions measurements to reflect changes to our business and improvements in data collection and reporting.\n\nWe participate in the CDP\u00ae reporting process. CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project, is an independent, international, nonprofit organization that provides a global system for companies and cities to measure, disclose, manage and share environmental information.\n\nOur latest score of A- from CDP reflects our leadership and high level of action on climate change mitigation, adaptation and transparency.\n\nUnder our science-based target goal linked to our annual CDP reporting, we have committed to reducing our Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon dioxide emissions 2.1% per year to achieve a 40% reduction by 2030 and a 50% reduction by 2035.\n\nNew this year, our annual GHG emissions and carbon intensities correspond to our fiscal year results, which will also be disclosed in our response to the annual CDP Climate Change questionnaire. Our results include data for HD Supply Holdings Inc., which we acquired on December 24, 2020.\n\nIn 2021, we decreased our Scope 1 and 2 carbon intensity. Our investments in efficiency helped us achieve a 21% reduction in the carbon dioxide emitted for each dollar of revenue we earned, compared to 2020.\n\n2021 RESULTS\n\nScope 1:\nDirect emissions from combustible sources and refrigerants totaled approximately 642,000 metric tons.\n\nScope 2:\nIndirect emissions from purchasing electricity totaled approximately 1,007,000 metric tons.\n\nScope 3:\nWe are currently assessing our Scope 3 emissions.\n\nCHECK IT OUT\nThe Home Depot joined RE100 with our goal to produce or procure 100% renewable electricity equivalent to the electricity needs for all Home Depot facilities by 2030. This action helps us move towards the company\u2019s emission reduction targets.\nPROTECTING THE CLIMATE\n\nSTORE OPERATIONS\n\nBy conserving resources we reduce business costs and our company\u2019s impact on the environment.\n\nRunning our stores more efficiently furthers both our business and sustainability goals. In 2021, we hit key milestones, including a 50% decrease in U.S. store electricity use since 2010.\n\nWhen we launched our store electricity conservation efforts a few years ago, we anticipated reducing U.S. store electricity use 20% over a decade. But by tapping into technologies and closely tracking and analyzing use, we were able to save more electricity than we originally imagined. (See chart.) In 2021 alone, we reduced year-over-year U.S. store electricity use approximately 11%.\n\nWe learned a great deal from the progress we made reducing electricity use in our stores, and now we are applying our experience and proven strategies to conserving resources in other areas of our business, including electricity use in our supply chain and water use in store irrigation.\n\nOur successful energy conservation efforts have helped us move closer to our goal of producing or procuring 100% renewable electricity equivalent to the electricity needs for all Home Depot facilities worldwide by 2030.\n\nLEDs Help Reduce Store Electricity Usage\n\nIn 2021, we completed our multi-year project to upgrade U.S. stores to overhead LED lighting, retrofitting 383 stores in 2021 alone. Now LEDs light up nearly all our store aisles across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. In the U.S., we have invested approximately $230 million in total capital expenditures on LED upgrades since 2018. Our U.S. stores with LEDs consume about 30% less electricity than similar stores with conventional lighting.\n\nCapitalizing on Solar\u2019s Evolution\n\nHarnessing power from the sun is essential to our renewable electricity aims, and we\u2019re making progress by buying electricity from large-scale commercial solar farms. In 2021, Enel Green Power\u2019s Azure Sky began operating in Haskell County, Texas, west of Dallas, providing us with 75 megawatts of renewable electricity. We have agreed to purchase another 150 megawatts from companies building solar farms elsewhere in Texas. Once operating, we expect these commercial solar farms, in addition to our wind farm projects, to provide us with enough electricity to power the equivalent of more than 500 Home Depot stores.\n\nDID YOU KNOW\n\nEnel Green Power\u2019s Azure Sky solar and storage plant in Texas began operating in 2021 and provides 75 megawatts of solar power to Home Depot stores.\n\nMaking Every kWh Count\n\nThe Home Depot reduced U.S. store electricity consumption 50% since 2010 through a multifaceted effort to find energy savings in every corner of the store. See our annual year-over-year progress below:\n\n| Year | Annual reduction in millions of kilowatt hours (kWh) |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| 2021 | 500                                                 |\n| 2020 | 450                                                 |\n| 2019 | 400                                                 |\n| 2018 | 350                                                 |\n| 2017 | 300                                                 |\n| 2016 | 250                                                 |\n| 2015 | 200                                                 |\n| 2014 | 150                                                 |\n| 2013 | 100                                                 |\n| 2012 | 50                                                  |\n| 2011 | 0                                                   |\n\nContinues on next page\nRooftop Solar Harvests Renewable Energy\n\nSeeing the potential to use soccer-field-size space atop our stores to harvest the sun\u2019s power, we installed our first rooftop solar farm in 2014. By the end of 2021, solar farms operated on 76 Home Depot stores and one distribution center in the U.S. In 2022, we\u2019re increasing our emphasis on rooftop solar by:\n\n- Increasing the amount of roof space allocated to solar panels at our stores\n- Exploring possibilities for adding solar panels atop more distribution facilities\n\nWater Use Drops with Smart Irrigation\n\nA pilot program launched in 2019 showed us the potential of using smart irrigation systems to save water at our stores. We rolled out the technology to 164 additional stores in 2021; 503 U.S. stores were using smart irrigation systems by the end of the year. On average, there is a 29% reduction in water used to irrigate landscaping, compared to stores with traditional timer-based irrigation systems.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: In-ground sensors, real-time weather data and other data sources guide when sprinklers come on and how long they operate. So, a store\u2019s landscaped areas are watered according to plants\u2019 needs, rather than the clock.\n\nCHECK IT OUT\n\nWe also help our customers harness the power of the sun. In partnership with Sunrun, we help our customers create clean and sustainable electricity.\nPROTECTING THE CLIMATE\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN\n\nBy making our supply chain more efficient, we reduce business costs and the impact that our product distribution has on the environment.\n\nWe continue to make progress on our multi-year supply chain initiative to create the fastest, most efficient and reliable delivery network for home improvement products.\n\nWhen we announced our approximately $1.2 billion supply chain initiative in 2017, we could have never envisioned the disruption to the global supply chain because of the pandemic. Due to our supply chain investments, however, we have demonstrated our ability to navigate any environment.\n\nIn addition, our supply chain investments have helped us move record amounts of product more efficiently. Despite seeing another year of record product volume move through our business, our new supply chain facilities helped us reduce the miles driven to get products from our vendors to our customers.\n\nEven as supply chain volume increased, the efficiencies we gained in our operations and our investments in green energy helped us reduce our carbon intensity. Learn more on Page 34.\n\n3 ECO-FRIENDLY SUPPLY CHAIN INNOVATIONS\n\n1. Added over 30 distribution centers - increasing speed and efficiency.\n\n2. Moved approximately 6.9 billion cubic feet of products through our supply chain - a company record.\n\n3. Reduced supply chain miles driven - despite moving record volume through our supply chain.\n\nWAYS WE'RE DRIVING SUPPLY CHAIN IMPROVEMENTS\n\nIn 2021, we installed hydrogen fuel cells at three U.S. supply chain facilities, giving us 15 locations with emissions-free fuel for forklifts. We estimate these fuel cells helped us reduce electricity consumption by about 21 million kilowatt hours in 2021.\n\nBy partnering with suppliers to forgo pallets, we can stack products to the top of trailers, resulting in a reduction in the number of truckloads needed to transport some goods.\n\nWe sell available space on our trucks and buy space from other companies, ensuring fewer underloaded trailers hit the road. That space sharing saves about 2 million driven miles a year.\n\nWe do a technology-assisted assessment of scheduled pickups and deliveries, then recommend optimized routes to reduce miles traveled, fuel consumed and trucks on the road.\n\nAs we roll out our new distribution facilities, we\u2019ve partnered with Plug Power to fuel some of our new facility\u2019s material handling fleets, like forklifts, with zero-emission hydrogen fuel. This is another way we are reducing our environmental impact while building a best-in-class supply chain.\n\nOptimization technology guides how we pack trucks or ocean-bound containers. We maximize the product load, reducing the number of truckloads and containers \u2014 and overall emissions.\n\nDID YOU KNOW\n\nWe participate in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s SmartWay\u00ae program to collect and report greenhouse gas emissions data from corporate supply chains. The Home Depot is a seven-time recipient of the SmartWay Excellence Award.\nSOURCING RESPONSIBLY\n\nETHICAL SOURCING\n\nWe support suppliers that take action toward maintaining our collective commitment to human rights and safety in our supply chain.\n\nWe owe it to our customers, associates and communities to further the collective commitment to human rights, safety and environmentally sound practices through ethical sourcing. We engage our suppliers in this commitment by requiring them to produce products in factories that adhere to responsible sourcing standards. We report on our progress in an annual Responsible Sourcing Report.\n\nOur Responsible Sourcing Standards mandate that suppliers and factories abide by all applicable international and local laws, rules and regulations in the manufacturing and distribution of merchandise or services provided to us. We conduct audits of factories around the world to ensure compliance with our responsible sourcing standards.\n\nSuppliers must maintain on-site documentation that demonstrates compliance with our responsible sourcing standards. They also must allow Home Depot associates and/or representatives full access to production facilities, worker records, production records and workers for confidential interviews in connection with monitoring visits. We expect our suppliers to promptly correct any noncompliance, starting with timely preparation and presentation of a corrective and preventative action plan. We also re-audit supplier facilities, with the frequency depending on their performance in prior audits.\n\nIf suppliers fail to improve, we may terminate our business relationships with them. Equally important, we support factories that take action to create lasting social and environmental compliance programs. We encourage suppliers and factory programs to communicate concerns via processes outlined in our corporate Code of Conduct.\n\nOur responsible sourcing audits are designed to assess compliance in these areas:\n\n- Laws and regulations\n- Child labor\n- Forced labor\n- Harassment and abuse\n- Compensation\n- Hours of work\n- Non-discrimination\n- Freedom of association and collective bargaining\n- Health and safety\n- Environment\n- Subcontracting\n- Communication\n- Business ethics\n- Monitoring and compliance\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\n1,487 factory audits\nand 1,632 follow-up visits conducted in 39 countries under our responsible sourcing policy in 2021\n\n232 factories audited for compliance at peak production\n\n83 subcontractors audited in 2021\n\nResponsible Sourcing Starts at the Top\n\nBoard of Directors and/or Audit Committee of the Board provides general oversight; receives annual progress report on and reviews results of the annual internal audit of the responsible sourcing program\n\nExecutive Leadership Team sets the tone for our ethical standards and provides oversight and guidance, as needed\n\nManagement responsible for owning and managing risks and implementing actions to ensure responsible sourcing objectives\n\nInternal Audit associates conduct annual audits to ensure our responsible sourcing program is effective and operating as expected\n\nThird-Party Auditors conduct our responsible sourcing compliance audits\n\nTHD\u2019s Responsible Sourcing Team dedicated associates focused on ensuring factories adhere to our standards\n\nHome Depot Global Sourcing Offices work with our supply chain to ensure compliance with our standards\nSOURCING RESPONSIBLY\n\nCONFLICT MINERALS\n\nWe work with our suppliers to ensure they implement responsible sourcing and encourage their smelters to obtain \u201cconflict-free\u201d designations.\n\nOur company expects all suppliers that manufacture our products to provide appropriate information and conduct due diligence to enable our compliance with conflict minerals laws. We also expect these manufacturers to obtain products and materials from suppliers that are not involved in funding conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining covered countries. We partner with our private brands and proprietary product suppliers whose products contain tin, tungsten, tantalum or gold (referred to as 3TG) to identify the source of any of these minerals in the supply chain.\n\nThrough our due diligence process, which aligns with guidance from the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, we received 100% participation from our in-scope private brands and proprietary-product Tier 1 suppliers.\n\nSixty-two percent of our in-scope Tier 1 suppliers indicated that one or more conflict minerals were necessary to the functionality or production of covered products, up from 32% in 2020. Of the smelters or refiners reported by these suppliers, only 48 out of a total of 311 uniquely identified smelters or refiners sourced conflict minerals from covered countries. Forty-three of these smelters or refiners were certified as DRC conflict-free by the Responsible Minerals Initiative, the London Bullion Market Association and/or the Responsible Jewellery Council.\n\nWe continue to work closely with our suppliers to ensure they implement responsible sourcing; obtain current, accurate and complete information about the supply chain; and encourage their smelters to obtain a \u201cconflict-free\u201d designation from an independent third-party auditor.\n\n2021 Progress\n\nAs detailed in The Home Depot\u2019s Conflict Minerals Report for the year ended Dec. 31, 2021, our efforts focused on collecting and disseminating information about the sourcing practices of our suppliers. We cataloged that information in a database using the conflict minerals reporting template developed by the Responsible Minerals Initiative\u00ae. We report this data for the calendar year, rather than our fiscal year, in line with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules.\n\nOur in-scope Tier 1 suppliers decreased to 21 in 2021 from 91 in 2020 and from 71 in 2019. In 2021, as part of our annual assessment of products in scope, we continued to exclude any supplier of products where the supplier merely affixed company brands, trademarks, logos or labels to generic products manufactured by a third party, as permitted by SEC guidance.\n\n100% of our in-scope private brands and proprietary-product Tier 1 suppliers participated over the last three years in our efforts to collect conflict minerals information.\nSOURCING RESPONSIBLY\n\nSUSTAINABLE FORESTRY\n\nWe strive to create transparency in how global forest resources are used in our products.\n\nThe Home Depot\u2019s focus on selling products made from sustainable sources of wood dates to 1994, when certified-sustainable wood shelving first arrived in our aisles. We recognize the environmental impact our company can have on the world\u2019s woodlands by working with suppliers that adhere to set standards of forest management and tree species selection. To help protect endangered forests and support efforts to preserve timber for future generations, we first issued our Wood Purchasing Policy in 1999. Since then, we have continued to update this policy, and have worked to lead our suppliers to understanding and practicing sustainable forestry throughout the world.\n\nWe know that responsible forest management is essential to protecting the health of our ecosystems, critical biodiversity and the more than one billion people who depend on forests for their livelihoods. The goal of our sustainable forestry efforts is to ensure timber and healthy forests remain available for future generations. We are proud of our ability to create positive change by encouraging sustainable forestry practices. We strive to better understand the social and economic effects that wood purchases have around the world, especially in regions with endangered forests.\n\nOver the years, we have focused our efforts to ensure the protection of forests at highest risk. While we sell less than 2% of the roundwood cut worldwide, we believe our efforts have had an outsized impact on the industry. We source approximately 86% from North America, approximately 8% from South America, approximately 3% from Asia, and less than 1% from each of Europe, Africa, and Oceania.\n\nWe believe that through our ongoing work with suppliers to sustainably manage forests and the commitments listed in our Wood Purchasing Policy, we have helped to expand forest land coverage in North America. Through the sharing of best practices with suppliers and ongoing engagement with stakeholders, we seek to build upon the progress we\u2019ve made to protect the world\u2019s forests.\n\nThe positive impact of our work with suppliers can be seen in our results. We also source lumber from a number of the largest forestry companies in North America, which work with sustainable forest management organizations like Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), Sustainable Forest Initiative (SFI), Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), and American Tree Farm to ensure their trees are being sourced sustainably.\n\nSuppliers of ours like Mendocino Redwood Company (MRC\u00ae) and Humboldt Redwood Company (HRC\u2122) seek to be examples of forest restoration and show how private forest management can protect and restore the ecological attributes of the forest, and whose forestlands are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council\u00ae (FSC) as being well-managed forests.\n\nWhile we are proud of the progress we have made to promote sustainable forestry, we continue to assess opportunities to drive progress in this area.\n\nWe continually work with stakeholders to promote sustainable forestry around the globe. Some of our current and future focus areas include:\n\n- Continuing to avoid areas of deforestation and conversion of natural ecosystems in our supply chain.\n- Engaging in a multiple stakeholder dialogue to develop a Canadian forest procurement framework.\n- Supporting the continual dialogue around the development of jurisdictional landscape. We believe that this approach, although complex, could contain the core foundation to aligning multiple stakeholders with community interests, like responsible commodity production, improved economic growth, and human wellbeing opportunities. Development of this approach has the potential to promote sustained community growth while protecting a region\u2019s natural resource base.\n\nCHECK IT OUT\n\nTo further our commitment to sustainable forestry and increased transparency, we recently committed to participating in the CDP forests questionnaire.\n\nContinues on next page\nData-Driven Sourcing\n\nUnderstanding the world\u2019s forest coverage by country helps guide our supply chain decisions. The vast majority of our wood product purchases originate from North America.\n\nSeventeen percent of the world\u2019s forests are in Canada and the United States, according to research by the United Nations Food & Agriculture Organization. The U.N.\u2019s 2020 *State of the World\u2019s Forests* report shows that more than half of the world\u2019s forest coverage is in five countries: Russia (20%), Brazil (12%), Canada (9%), the U.S. (8%) and China (5%).\n\nThe Home Depot\u2019s Wood Purchasing Policy outlines our commitment to:\n\n- Give preference to the purchase of wood and wood products originating from certified, well-managed forests wherever feasible.\n- Eliminate the purchase of wood and wood products from forest regions identified as endangered.\n- Practice and promote the efficient and responsible use of wood and wood products.\n- Promote and support the development and use of alternative environmental products.\n- Not accept wood products from the Amazon or Congo Basin areas, Papua New Guinea or the Solomon Islands, unless they\u2019re Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified.\n- Demand that our vendors and their suppliers of wood and wood products maintain compliance with laws and regulations pertaining to their operations and the products they manufacture.\n\nCHECK IT OUT\n\nVisit the Sustainable Forestry page of our Eco Actions website to learn more about our initiatives to protect the world\u2019s forests and how we work with suppliers to create high standards for forest management.\nREDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT\n\nGREENER PRODUCTS\n\nOur greatest environmental impact comes from the products we sell, and our biggest opportunity to create change is helping customers live more sustainably.\n\nEco Options\n\nThe Home Depot\u2019s Eco Options program continues to help our customers identify products that have less of an impact on the environment and encourages our suppliers to provide more sustainable offerings.\n\nWe launched Eco Options in 2007 in partnership with SCS Global Services, a leading, independent, third-party certification body that validates environmental claims.\n\nFor a product to receive Eco Options classification, the supplier must document attributes that prove it has less of an impact on the environment than comparable products in the same category. Until all industries create and abide by a reporting formula that measures product attributes according to a common sustainability standard, we will continue to use our Eco Options program to help customers sort through green product claims.\n\nEco Actions\n\nWe continue to look for ways to help our customers reduce their environmental impact through the projects they take on. Building on the progress we\u2019ve made with our Eco Options program, in April 2021 we launched our new Eco Actions program, which provides our customers with the resources they need to take individual action on environmental issues.\n\nOur Eco Actions website provides customers with new content, insights and ideas from innovative partners to inspire sustainable action. Eco Action\u2019s growing library of sustainable-DIY content includes:\n\n- Reducing emissions with battery-powered outdoor equipment\n- Installing a water-conserving shower faucet\n- Reducing waste through our tool repair services\n- Highlighting responsibly sourced wood products\n- Benefits of organic gardening\n\nEco Actions is just another way we\u2019re helping our customers make sustainable changes for the better by helping them create greener homes.\n\nFocus on Forestry and Responsible Chemistry\n\nIn addition to our Eco Options and Eco Actions programs, we focus our sustainable product efforts in two key areas relevant to our business: forestry and indoor air quality.\n\nIn 1999, we established a Wood Purchasing Policy to help avoid wood products coming from forestland with a high conservation value. Since then, we have continued to update this policy, and have worked to lead our suppliers to understanding and practicing sustainable forestry throughout the world.\n\nAnd in 2017, we published our Chemical Strategy (see Page 46) to encourage the exclusion of certain chemicals from paint, flooring, insulation, household cleaning and paint removers. Our chemical strategy is an important part of our commitment to offer greener products.\n\nDID YOU KNOW\n\nThe Home Depot was honored with four Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Awards in 2021.

We encourage supplier innovation in product and packaging design, material selection and manufacturing, as well as striving to produce products that have positive environmental impact during use.\n\nSince we introduced Circularity as one of our Eco Options\u2019 pillars in 2019, our focus has been to prevent products and packaging from becoming waste throughout the product lifecycle. The foundation of Circularity comes from nature: nothing is wasted, and everything is regenerative.\n\nWe strive to offer products with a positive environmental impact, and we encourage suppliers to innovate in how they produce and package products for reuse and longevity. We carry millions of products, and many have the potential to move our economy toward circularity.\n\nWe also look for opportunities within Home Depot operations to reduce, repair, reuse and recycle. The goal is to extend our planet\u2019s natural resources and protect land and water from the impact of material disposal.\n\nAlong with our suppliers and vendors, we are developing our thinking and capabilities in an effort to:\n\n- Design with the environment in mind\n- Eliminate excess material\n- Eliminate materials that are not readily reusable or recyclable\n- Minimize mixed materials to enable simpler disassembly and recycling\n- Utilize materials that are biodegradable or readily recyclable\n- Utilize recycled content, when possible, without compromising product efficacy\n- Facilitate the reuse of material indefinitely\n- Promote minimization of environmental impact in manufacturing and consumer use\n\n3 WAYS THE HOME DEPOT SUPPORTS CIRCULARITY\n\n1. **RECYCLE** by separating and collecting raw materials from our own waste streams, and working with our suppliers to turn them into new products.\n\n2. **REPAIR** items in our stores and for our customers to extend the life of products and avoid the energy emissions from manufacturing replacements.\n\n3. **REUSE** materials so less waste goes into landfills.\n\n### PROGRESS IN 2021\n\n| RECYCLE | REPAIR | REUSE |\n|---------|--------|-------|\n| 18.3 million pounds of plastic (LDPE) | 233,900 tools repaired by The Home Depot | 114,900 tons of returns salvaged |\n| 272,900 tons of cardboard (OCC) | 10,700 tool repairs referred to third-party service providers | 2.2 million pounds of returns donated |\n| 2,358,000 pounds of EPS foam | 61,200 large equipment repairs for Tool Rental | 8.7 million tool rental transactions |\n| 138,700 tons of metal | 62,200 repairs of store equipment | |\n| 204,300 lead-acid battery cores | | |\n| 514,200 pounds of CFL bulbs | | |\n| 1.2 million pounds of rechargeable batteries | | |\n| 2.8 million pounds of obsolete technology assets | | |\n\nCHECK IT OUT\n\nSee how The Home Depot partners with Nike to move towards a circular future in which the very concept of waste doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nNike Grind diverts shoes and material waste away from landfills and transforms them into a variety of new products, including carpet cushions and gym flooring tiles sold at The Home Depot.\nCIRCULARITY: THE BOX GOES ON\n\nSee how we\u2019re recycling would-be waste into useful products over and over again. Supplier Pratt Industries produces all Home Depot moving boxes, made from 100% recycled material.\n\n1. We collect used cardboard, paper and other recyclable fibers and send them to Pratt.\n\n2. Pratt separates and compresses the fibers at a materials recovery facility.\n\n3. The next stop is a paper mill, where fibers are cleaned and pressed into strong, flexible paper.\n\n4. At a corrugating plant, layers of paper are crimped and glued together to create sheets of cardboard.\n\n5. At a Pratt converting facility, cardboard sheets are cut into boxes printed with our logo.\n\n6. Boxes are distributed through our supply chain to stock stores and fulfill online orders.\n\n7. Customers purchase millions of our THD-branded moving boxes every year.\n\n8. Our operations and our customers provide used boxes for recycling, and the process begins again.\nREDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT\n\nRESPONSIBLE CHEMISTRY\n\nWe\u2019re addressing chemicals of concerns in our products and providing transparency into our approach in our regularly updated Chemical Strategy.\n\nAt The Home Depot, we recognize the opportunity we have for the environmental impact of our organization, and that our biggest impact is the products we sell. In partnership with stakeholders throughout the supply chain, we are committed to offering products that are safer for the environment and our customers.\n\nWith our encouragement, our suppliers have been investing in developing environmentally innovative products. The Home Depot supports the work of the Green Chemistry & Commerce Council (GC3) through annual membership and participation in the Retail Leadership Council of the GC3, and we participated in developing the GC3\u2019s Joint Statement on using Green Chemistry and Safer Alternatives to Advance Sustainable Products.\n\nWe and many of our suppliers also partner with respected third-party certification organizations and environmental non-profits that guide the home improvement industry toward safer chemical ingredient use. The Home Depot is committed to continuing the drive toward minimizing the environmental impact of the products we sell.\n\nOUR COMMITMENT\n\n- The Home Depot is committed to increasing our assortment of products that maintain third-party certifications of their chemical ingredients, and that meet high environmental standards.\n- The Home Depot works with many suppliers in efforts to improve chemicals in categories with the greatest potential impact on indoor air quality.\n- We encourage our suppliers to continually review key categories to track progress on environmental innovations in green chemistry.\n- The Home Depot will evaluate this strategy annually to ensure our approach, goals and disclosure are appropriate and meet the needs of our stakeholders.\n\nVinyl\n\nThe Home Depot vinyl flooring suppliers are setting the pace for change in this category with efforts to continually improve the chemical profile of their products. As of January 2016, no ortho-phthalates are permitted as added plasticizers in vinyl flooring sold in Home Depot stores in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nFLOORING\n\nCarpet\n\nThe Home Depot\u2019s carpet suppliers have been at the forefront of the industry-wide removal of chemicals of concern and the exploration of safer alternatives. All indoor wall-to-wall carpet sold through The Home Depot U.S. and Canada has a third-party verification of transparency through DECLARE\u00ae Label or Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), or certification of material health through Cradle to Cradle\u2122 Products Innovation Institute or CRI Green Label Plus\u00ae. The following chemicals of concern are excluded from indoor wall-to-wall carpet in our U.S. and Canada stores:\n\n- Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) or perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)\n- Triclosan\n- Organotins\n- Ortho-phthalates\n- Vinyl chloride\n- Nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs)\n- Coal fly ash\n- Formaldehyde\n- Added heavy metals\n- Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAs)\n\nLaminate Flooring\n\nLaminate flooring in Home Depot stores is verified by either GREENGUARD Gold or FloorScore\u00ae certification to contain 0.0073 ppm or less of formaldehyde, which is a stricter standard than CARB 2 of 0.05 ppm.\n\nContinues on next page\nRESIDENTIAL HOUSEHOLD CLEANING CHEMICALS\n\nThe Home Depot continues to work with suppliers to improve products that impact indoor air quality. As a result, we are asking our suppliers to exclude the following chemicals from the manufacturing of all residential household cleaning chemical products sold in Home Depot stores by the end of 2022:\n\n- Propyl-paraben\n- Butyl-paraben\n- Diethyl phthalates\n- Dibutyl phthalates\n- Formaldehyde (Added)\n- Nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs)\n- Triclosan\n- Toluene\n- Trichloroethylene (TCE)\n\nIn addition, our Eco Options program identifies environmentally preferred products, including cleaners that have obtained certifications from independent third-party testers such as EPA\u2019s Safer Choice and Cradle to Cradle.\n\nINSULATION\n\nOur fiberglass insulation suppliers have persistently challenged themselves to remove certain chemicals of concern from their products over the last decade. As a result, 100% of our fiberglass insulation products in the U.S. and Canada are GREENGUARD Gold certified and do not contain the following chemicals of concern:\n\n- Brominated flame retardants\n- Halogenated flame retardants\n- Antimony trioxide\n- Formaldehyde\n- Added heavy metals\n\nGARDENING\n\nOrganic gardening has grown from niche to mainstream, and The Home Depot has expanded its organic gardening products to offer multiple brands of soils, fertilizers, and weed and pest control products to meet our customers\u2019 changing needs. In 2016 we launched local, organic vegetables and herbs. We expanded the program in 2017 to half our U.S. stores and have committed to continue to expand our organics assortment.\n\nWe also committed at the end of 2018 to no longer treat plants in our garden centers with neonicotinoids, except where mandated by state law.\n\nPAINTING PRODUCTS\n\nPaints\n\nOur paint suppliers have taken efforts over the last ten years to evolve their paints and offer products that help maintain air quality.

Methylene chloride has historically been the most effective product option in this category.\n\nThe Home Depot is committed to working with suppliers and the EPA to identify alternatives with comparable efficacy. The Home Depot phased out methylene chloride and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) from paint removal products at the end of 2018.\n\nOur current U.S. and Canada zero- and low-VOC paints are outlined here:\n\n| VOC VALUE <5g/L = zero VOC |\n|---------------------------|\n| BEHRPro i300 Interior     |\n| Glidden Diamond Interior  |\n| Glidden Premium Interior  |\n| PPG Speedhide Pro EV Zero |\n\n| VOC VALUE <50g/L = low VOC |\n|---------------------------|\n| BEHR MARQUEE Ceiling Paint|\n| BEHR MARQUEE Exterior     |\n| BEHR Premium Plus Ceiling Paint|\n| BEHR Premium Plus Exterior|\n| BEHR Premium Plus Interior|\n| BEHR Premium Plus Ultra Ceiling paint|\n| BEHR Premium Plus Ultra Exterior|\n| BEHR Premium Plus Ultra Interior|\n| BEHRPro i100 Interior     |\n| Glidden Ceiling Paint     |\n| Glidden Essentials Exterior|\n| Glidden Essentials Interior|\n| Glidden Premium Exterior  |\n| PPG Breakthrough          |\n| PPG Multi-Pro             |\n| PPG Speedhide             |\n| Glidden Speed Pro (CANADA)|\n| Glidden Ultra Hide (CANADA)|\n\nNote: Colorants added to base paints may increase VOC level, depending on color choice.\nThe Home Depot encourages suppliers to make the products we sell more energy efficient, and our partnership with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Energy Star\u00ae program supports those efforts, too.\n\nIn 2021, we helped our customers save $1.5 billion on utility bills through the purchase and proper use of energy-efficient products. Energy Star-labeled products were key to that progress. In 2021, we offered over 22,000 energy-saving products in stores and online, including more than 15,000 Energy Star products. We sold more than 200 million units of Energy Star products.\n\nWe estimate our customers\u2019 purchases of Energy Star products in 2021 helped reduce annual electricity use by 7 billion kilowatt hours, saving $950 million on energy costs and lowering carbon emissions by 4.9 million metric tons.\n\nDID YOU KNOW\nThe Home Depot U.S. is a 12-time Energy Star award winner and our Canadian stores were recognized for the eighth year in a row as the ENERGY STAR Canada Retailer of the Year in 2021. See how our Canadian division is improving sustainability on Page 71.\n\nGOING GREEN, SAVING GREEN\n\nEnergy Star-labeled clothes dryers use 20% less electricity. If all clothes dryers sold in the U.S. were Energy Star certified, Americans could collectively save more than $1.5 billion each year in utility costs and prevent greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to those from more than 2 million vehicles.\n\nClothes washers use about 25% less energy and 33% less water when they\u2019re Energy Star-certified.\n\nSource: EPA\nREDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT\n\nWATER-SAVING PRODUCTS\n\nThe Home Depot helps protect water resources nationwide by selling products designed to conserve.\n\nIn alignment with the U.N. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, we work with suppliers to encourage the production of water-conserving products, which we, in turn, offer to our customers. Our greatest opportunity to effect environmental change for the better is by selling eco-friendly products that help drive efficient use of resources in communities we serve.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to help our customers conserve water in their homes and businesses. Across our stores and online, we offered more than 8,000 water-saving products, including more than 5,000 products bearing the EPA\u2019s WaterSense label, and we sold nearly 21 million units of those WaterSense products.\n\nWe estimate our customers\u2019 purchases of WaterSense products in 2021 helped reduce annual water consumption by over 66 billion gallons, which would collectively mean savings of more than $873 million on water bills.\n\nThe EPA estimates that household leaks can add up to nearly 1 trillion gallons of water lost every year. Fixing these leaks conserves water and can also reduce utility bills by about 10%. We provide project guides on our Eco Actions website to help educate customers on fixing or replacing leaky faucets.\n\nDID YOU KNOW\n\nOur company has been a WaterSense Partner of the Year eight times since 2011, receiving the Sustained Excellence awards in three of those years.\n\nGOING GREEN, SAVING GREEN\n\nThe average family in the U.S. could save 2,700 gallons of water per year by installing WaterSense-labeled showerheads.\n\nReplacing old, inefficient faucets and aerators with WaterSense-labeled models can save the average family 700 gallons of water per year, equal to the amount of water needed to take 45 showers.\n\nToilets account for nearly 30% of an average home\u2019s water use. Replacing old toilets with WaterSense models can save nearly 13,000 gallons a year.\n\nSource: EPA\nREDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT\n\nGARDENING\n\nOur partnerships with local growers enable us to offer healthy, environmentally beneficial plants, reduce emissions and support businesses in the communities we serve.\n\nThe Home Depot partners with our growers and suppliers in advance of each growing season to offer healthy trees, blooms and edible plants that support local environments and pollinators. Our gardening product offerings are informed by our understanding that backyards, balconies and patios are well-being retreats for our customers and mini-ecosystems that have an impact on their surroundings.\n\nGrowing Organic\n\nWe offer more than 40 varieties of organic, non-GMO vegetable and herb plants grown according to methods approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Organic Program. Only products that have been certified as meeting the USDA\u2019s organic production and handling standards may carry the USDA Organic seal.\n\nNative Plants\n\nOur growers work closely with U.S. states\u2019 departments of agriculture to identify invasive plants that may threaten local native plants.\n\nSupporting Local Growers\n\nWe are proud to partner with more than 135 plant growers who balance the impact of their production with local environmental issues and growing conditions in their regions.\n\nCHECK IT OUT\n\nSee our assortment of organic soils, seeds, plants and more at HomeDepot.com.

We partner with vendors to keep improving how we and our customers reduce, reuse and recycle.\n\nHazardous Materials Disposal & Handling\nWe seek sustainable methods of disposal, and, in 2021, our company recycled or reused for energy 30% of the hazardous waste generated from our operations and customer returns. We properly disposed of the remaining waste.\n\nAssociate Training & Resources\nAssociates receive training on recognizing hazardous materials. Associates responsible for managing storage and cleanup of hazardous materials complete additional in-depth environmental compliance training.\n\nInformation about and guidance for the cleanup, classification, labeling and storage of hazardous waste is available to associates through company-issued handheld devices and our associate intranet site.\n\nPreventative Actions\nWe take specific steps to avoid spills and contamination across the store with particular focus on these areas:\n\nGarden center\u2014Proper handling of fertilizer and pesticides bags, including checking for and properly repairing damaged bags\n\nReceiving and central storage\u2014Appropriate procedures for handling, accumulating, storing, labeling and inventorying hazardous waste and separating potentially incompatible materials\n\nInspections of key areas\u2014Routine inspections of garden areas, parking lots and store entrances identify potential problems; scheduled sweeps of fertilizer aisles and parking lots help protect against hazardous materials entering the environment\n\nResponsive Actions\nIf a spill does occur, we have the following resources in place to properly address it:\n\nSpill kits and containers\u2014Located throughout each store for prompt and effective cleanup and disposal of hazardous materials such as paint, solvents, aerosols, oil, fuel, pesticides and fertilizers\n\nEmergency response\u2014A third-party consultant provides an emergency response team available 24/7 to assist with hazardous materials cleanup and, if necessary, provide remediation services\n\nSUSTAINABLE SHREDDING\nIn the U.S., The Home Depot provided over 5.4 million pounds of shredded paper for recycling in 2021.

That\u2019s good for the planet and our business.\n\nThe Home Depot\u2019s packaging team works with our private-label product suppliers to apply science to creating better packaging. Our goal is to reduce package footprints and use more sustainable materials to secure and protect the private-label products we sell. From 2017 through 2021, our packaging innovations allowed us to redesign 652 packages to reduce size and materials.\n\nIn 2021, our packaging team continued to innovate as they undertook a large project aimed at reducing packaging across our Crown Bolt products, Home Depot\u2019s private brand of fasteners and building hardware. This project touched over 16 million packaging units, across nearly 300 SKUs.\n\nUsing Less EPS & PVC\n\nIn 2021, our packaging team continued to find substitutes for expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) film in our private-label products. EPS foam is good at protecting products from damage, but it contains beads of chemicals and oil that are often difficult to recycle and can take more than a century to biodegrade. We continue to look across our private-label products to find even the smallest amounts of EPS and replace it with easier-to-recycle materials like molded pulp and paper.\n\nPVC film is a thin, rigid synthetic plastic polymer that\u2019s molded around products to secure and protect them. But, like EPS, it is tough to recycle and takes a long time to break down naturally, and we\u2019re working hard to use less of it.\n\nIn 2020, we committed to eliminating EPS foam and PVC film from our private-label packages by 2023, prompting us to dig even deeper for results.\n\n2021 BY THE NUMBERS\n\n286 packages were redesigned to reduce size and materials\n\n274,600 cubic feet of EPS foam was removed from our private-label packaging \u2014 enough to fill 138 school buses\n\n1,119,700 square feet of PVC film was eliminated \u2014 enough to cover 19 football fields\n\nCHECK IT OUT\n\nWe\u2019re compressing EPS waste from our operations into foam blocks that can be repurposed into new products, such as insulation \u2014 keeping the material out of landfills. Meet the entrepreneurial associate who launched this initiative.\n\n...\nSUSTAINABLE PACKAGING\n\nOur practice of engaging with our stakeholders on ESG topics helped us design a more sustainable packaging solution for some of our LED lightbulbs. In response to customer feedback, we have sought to remove the excess plastic from our ECOSMART\u00ae LED bulb packaging. In this regard, our packaging team went to work looking for a new way to package the bulbs without the need for plastic. The redesign that our packaging team came up with helped eliminate the need for plastic in the packaging, while also reducing the size of the box.\n\nRedesigned packaging helped remove more than 133,000 pounds of plastic.\n\nPaper packaging protects as well as molded plastic but is recyclable and requires less space.\n\nThe new design also reduced the packaging size by more than 20% decreasing shipping space required, and lowering transportation emissions.\nSTRENGTHEN OUR COMMUNITIES\n\nRESOURCES\n\n> Supplier Diversity\n> Diversity Partnerships\n> Retool Your School\n> The Home Depot Foundation\n> Team Depot\n> Disaster Response\n> U.N.

Our Supplier Diversity program was established in 2003, with the goal of increasing shareholder value, driving innovation and creating positive impact in the communities we serve. We celebrate and invest in minority entrepreneurs because we understand their critical role in driving innovation, creating jobs and meaningful solutions in our communities. In 2021, we spent $3.3 billion with diverse suppliers, compared to $3.2 billion the previous year.\n\nDiverse businesses are identified as U.S.-based, for-profit and 51% or more owned, controlled and operated by U.S. citizens or people with U.S. permanent resident alien status that fall under one of the following categories: woman, ethnic minority, veteran, LGBTQ, individuals with a disability.\n\nIn 2021, we launched a Tier II supplier diversity program designed to drive more spending from our direct Tier I suppliers to diverse businesses. We\u2019re working to better ensure that a portion of the money we spend on products and services, even with suppliers that are not identified as diverse, makes its way to diverse enterprises. The Home Depot provides supplier development programs and mentoring to assist diverse suppliers with business growth, and we partner with organizations that provide certification, education and opportunities for capital and networking.\n\nSUPPLIER DIVERSITY VISION STATEMENT\n\nThe Home Depot is building inclusive and sustainable business opportunities for women, minority, veteran, disability and LGBTQ owned companies.

These kits provided essential supplies to communities as they experienced the third most active hurricane season on record.\n\nFollowing Hurricane Ida, the second-most damaging hurricane ever to make landfall in Louisiana, The Home Depot Foundation and Team Depot volunteers stepped into action. The Home Depot Foundation committed up to $1 million to support immediate disaster relief in the communities that were impacted. Team Depot volunteers from Courthouse, Ohio, gathered supplies and loaded materials including generators, box fans, and more, to be shipped nearly 900 miles away to the Children\u2019s Hospital New Orleans. Volunteers in Texas, Georgia and Alabama also worked to assemble thousands of disaster relief kits, which included items like cleaning supplies, N95 masks, hand sanitizer and other recovery essentials (Learn more here).\n\nIn the days following the devastating Marshall Fire in Boulder, Colorado, the most destructive fire in the state\u2019s history, Team Depot built and distributed over 600 sifters and donated personal protective equipment (PPE) to assist families who lost their homes.

Our Lead Director is annually elected by the independent members of the Board. For the past several years, having a combined chairman and CEO, an independent Lead Director, and Board committees composed entirely of independent directors, together with other robust corporate governance practices, has provided strong independent oversight of management while ensuring clear strategic alignment throughout the company.\n\nIn early 2022, in connection with our CEO succession process, the Board split the CEO and Chair roles to support the leadership transition. Our former CEO, Craig Menear, remained as Board Chair following the appointment of Ted Decker as CEO and President. The independent members of the Board will continue to assess the Board leadership structure over time and determine what best supports the company\u2019s needs.\n\nOur corporate governance policies reflect best practices:\n\nShareholder Protections\n\n- Annual election of directors with majority voting standard in uncontested director elections\n- Shareholder ability to call special meetings and act by written consent\n- A market standard shareholder right of proxy access\n- Independent Lead Director\n- Approximately 86% of directors and all Board committee members are independent\n- Director mandatory retirement age (age 72)\n- No shareholder rights plan, also referred to as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d\n\nBoard Engagement and Oversight\n\n- Annual Board strategy session and review of the company\u2019s strategic plan\n- Director overboarding policy\n- Store-walk policy for directors\n- Board education and orientation program\n- Annual Board and committee self-evaluations, including individual director interviews\n- Management succession policy set forth in Corporate Governance Guidelines\n- Independent directors meet without management\n\nOur proxy statement offers more details about corporate governance and risk management. Go to our Corporate Governance Overview for additional information on our corporate governance practices.\nBoard Committees\n\nOur Board of Directors has established four standing committees, each comprised solely of independent directors and governed by a written charter that sets forth its purpose, composition, powers, duties and responsibilities.\n\nBoard Oversight of Risk\n\nThe company has a robust framework designed to identify and ensure proper management of risk, including risk related to our ability to operate responsibly and sustainably. The framework that we use to identify and manage risk considers a number of enterprise-level issues, including competitive environment, brand and reputation, regulatory and compliance, and security, as well as external and internal factors that could distract the Company from our business or derail our strategic objectives. The Board oversees risk through this framework, with oversight accomplished by identifying key risks and mapping them to the appropriate Board Committee or to the full Board.\n\nOur Board reviews these key risks and the related framework annually, and the full Board or appropriate Board committees discuss selected risks in more detail throughout the year, including the COVID-19 pandemic, its related risks and its impact on our enterprise risk framework. The table below identifies key risk areas overseen by the Board and its committees.\n\n| BOARD OF DIRECTORS |\n|---------------------|\n| AUDIT COMMITTEE     |\n| FINANCE COMMITTEE   |\n| LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT & COMPENSATION (LDC) COMMITTEE |\n| NOMINATING & CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (NCG) COMMITTEE |\n\n| FULL BOARD |\n|------------|\n| \u2022 Has primary responsibility for risk oversight, including approval of strategic objectives and defining risk appetite |\n| \u2022 Delegates oversight of management of certain risks to Board committees |\n| \u2022 Receives regular reports from the committees regarding risk-related matters |\n\n| AUDIT | FINANCE | LDC COMMITTEE | NCG COMMITTEE |\n|-------|---------|---------------|---------------|\n| \u2022 Overall risk assessment and management |\n| \u2022 Financial exposures, statements, controls, systems and reporting |\n| \u2022 Regulatory and compliance, including FCPA/anti-bribery and our whistleblower program |\n| \u2022 Data protection and cybersecurity |\n| \u2022 Internal audit and related investigatory matters |\n| \u2022 Quality, safety and responsible sourcing |\n| \u2022 Long-range strategic planning |\n| \u2022 Long-range financial outlook and finance-related risks |\n| \u2022 Capital structure, including investments and shareholder return principles |\n| \u2022 Annual capital plan and key capital investments |\n| \u2022 Merger and acquisition strategy |\n| \u2022 Senior executive compensation |\n| \u2022 Senior executive succession planning |\n| \u2022 Overall risk related to the company\u2019s compensation policies and practices |\n| \u2022 Human capital management |\n| \u2022 Non-employee director compensation |\n| \u2022 Diversity, equity and inclusion, including pay equity |\n| \u2022 Corporate governance |\n| \u2022 Director succession planning and board composition |\n| \u2022 Policies on political activity, including political spending and payments to trade associations |\n| \u2022 Related-person transactions |\n| \u2022 Corporate social responsibility and environmental efforts, risks and opportunities |\nGOVERNMENT RELATIONS\n\nThe Home Depot recognizes that laws at the federal, state and local level impact our business.\n\nWe actively participate, and encourage our associates to participate, in the political process. Our Political Activity and Government Relations Policy provides the framework for our political activity. We engage in three key ways:\n\n\u2022 Our Government Relations department protects and expands our company\u2019s ability to take care of our associates, customers and shareholders through effective regulatory and legislative action. Our Government Relations team works to optimize the government\u2019s impact on the business through effective lobbying, relationship building and political engagement.\n\n\u2022 We have a political action committee (PAC) that connects our salaried associates to the political process and pools their personal contributions to financially support pro-business candidates who understand issues of importance to The Home Depot and our associates. As a long-standing practice, we do not contribute to presidential campaigns or endorse presidential candidates.\n\n\u2022 The Home Depot supports trade associations that advocate on behalf of the business community and retail sector and reports annually the aggregate dues paid to those associations that engage in lobbying activities.\n\nIn deciding where we want to focus our advocacy, these are some of our top priorities:\n\n\u2022 Driving sales by ensuring online-only marketplaces follow the same rules on accountability and transparency as interconnected retailers\n\n\u2022 Supporting our Supply Chain initiative by advocating for funding for roads, ports and bridges and for laws that allow safer, heavier trucks to reduce loads and our environmental footprint\n\n\u2022 Growing margin dollars by working to get laws passed that target sophisticated, organized retail crime rings to reduce theft and support free trade\n\n\u2022 Taking care of our people by making sure we have a say in laws that could affect associate flexibility and career growth\n\nCHECK IT OUT\n\nFor the first time, The Home Depot has created an Economic Impact interactive map that highlights the importance of its business in communities around the country. The Economic Impact map, which was created in collaboration between our Government Relations, Tax and Strategic Business Development teams, along with PwC, includes information about employment numbers, taxes, community involvement, and donations of critical COVID-19 supplies. The map gives a state-by-state breakdown so customers and associates can easily see the impact in their communities.\nOversight of Our Political Activity\n\nOur Government Relations department, led by a vice president who reports to our general counsel, manages our political activity. The team carefully analyzes our engagement activities, trade association partnerships, and political contributions for alignment with our key priorities, guided by our Core Values. All of The Home Depot\u2019s political contributions are made to promote the interests of the company and without regard for the private political preferences of executives or directors. The Government Relations team is responsible for ensuring all PAC and corporate political contributions are made in accordance with the law and company policies. The team participates in regular trainings and performs routine reviews to monitor compliance.\n\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors provides additional oversight, conducting an annual review of our Political Activity and Government Relations Policy, the company\u2019s political contributions and payments to trade associations that engage in lobbying activities.\n\nThe Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee must approve in advance any public advertisement directly or indirectly paid for by the Company that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a candidate in which Home Depot is identified specifically as an advocate of such election or defeat. To date, the company has not made any expenditure for such electioneering communications, and has no present plans to make any such expenditures.\n\nThe Home Depot PAC\u2019s finances, governance and communications are governed by a PAC Board. The PAC Board is chaired by the vice president of Government Relations and is made up of representatives from each functional area of the business and each field division to ensure a wide range of experiences and perspectives.\n\nWe provide transparency in our actions by publishing an annual report of the company\u2019s political contributions and the aggregate dues paid to trade associations that engage in lobbying activities, and any independent political expenditures by the Company supporting or opposing ballot initiatives and contributions to ballot measures committees. We list trade associations to which our company makes yearly payments of $5,000 or more, and our PAC contributions are publicly available on the Federal Election Commission website.\n\nPATH OF THE PAC DOLLAR\n\nOur political action committee connects salaried associates to the political process and pools their personal contributions to financially support pro-business candidates who understand issues of importance to The Home Depot and our associates.\n\n1. PREPARE\n   Eligible associates voluntarily choose to join The Home Depot PAC.\n\n2. PACKAGE\n   All participating associate contributions are pooled.\n   $2,447,000 contributed to candidates and their leadership PACs in FY 2021\n   13,000+ individual contributors in that election cycle\n\n3. QUALITY ASSURANCE\n   Our Core Values drive all strategic decisions inside our company, and we build relationships with elected officials who help enable our ability to implement those strategies to the benefit of our associates, customers, shareholders and communities. Here are the primary, business-focused criteria the PAC considers when deciding which candidates to support:\n   \u2022 Service on key committees important to The Home Depot\n   \u2022 Favorable position on one or more legislative issues that align with The Home Depot\u2019s business objectives\n   \u2022 Service in a current or potential leadership position\n   \u2022 Location of a Home Depot facility in the candidate\u2019s district\n   \u2022 Industry support from business and retail organizations\n\n4. DISTRIBUTE\n   PAC funds are distributed to candidates and their leadership PACs.\n\n5. CONNECT\n   We work to build relationships with lawmakers who are well positioned to legislate on issues important to THD and our associates.\n\n6. ASSESS\n   Legislators make informed decisions on issues affecting our company.\nCORPORATE TAXES\n\nWe do the right thing for our associates, shareholders and communities by ensuring we pay our fair share of taxes and manage them transparently.\n\nTaxes are a significant component of The Home Depot\u2019s economic contribution to the countries, states and local communities in which we operate. Our commitment to our core values informs how we approach taxes. Responsible management of The Home Depot\u2019s taxes includes:\n\n- Seeking reasonable interpretations of laws where there may be ambiguity\n- Engaging proactively and transparently with tax authorities, when appropriate, to seek clarity, guidance or agreement on tax positions\n\nAccountability & Governance\nTax governance is overseen by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. At least once a year, company leaders report to the Audit Committee regarding our approach to managing taxes. Learn more about our Corporate Governance structure on Page 76.\n\nRisk Management\nWe identify and manage risks associated with taxes, including:\n- Legislative uncertainty\n- Reputational risk, including that a tax position taken by the company may not be consistent with our guiding principles or may expose the company to negative publicity\n- Scarcity of talented tax professionals to recruit and hire as associates\n\nCompliance\nWe comply with tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including reporting and paying our taxes in a timely manner by:\n- Employing appropriate resources and controls to ensure that our tax reporting is accurate and complete\n- Supporting audits of our tax reporting and control environment by our internal control team and independent, third-party auditors, as required for publicly traded companies\n\nAlignment with Our Business\nOur corporate entity structure reflects the alignment with our commercial activities to ensure that we pay our fair share of tax commensurate with our business\u2019 geographical footprint and operations within a jurisdiction. Additionally, we seek and claim tax incentives that:\n- Align with our business\n- Are consistent with the statutory or regulatory framework\n- Drive economic development and job creation in the communities in which we operate\n\nStakeholder Engagement\nWe actively engage with federal, state and local governments; tax authorities; trade associations; and other business groups to advocate for policies that align with our approach to tax management, including the ways we:\n- Support tax policies that drive a vibrant, competitive and growing economy\n- Staff our stores based upon revenue generated within the stores; thus, a strong economy that includes balanced taxation policy drives revenue that supports employment\n\nTHE HOME DEPOT\u2019S 2021 TAX PAYMENTS\n\n| Tax Type                        | Amount       |\n|---------------------------------|--------------|\n| Federal Income Tax              | $4.045 billion |\n| State Income Tax                | $933 million  |\n| Foreign & Territorial Income Tax| $526 million  |\n| Other Income & Business Taxes   | $1.095 billion |\n| Property Taxes                  | $655 million  |\n| Sales Taxes                     | $9.576 billion |\n| Payroll Taxes                   | $4.588 billion |\n| **Total**                       | **$21.418 billion** |\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\nThe Home Depot paid approximately 1% of the total net corporate income taxes collected by the U.S. government in 2021\n\nOur company files 10,000+ sales tax returns every year\n\nWe own, lease and pay property taxes on 3,000+ buildings worldwide, including stores, distribution centers and offices\n\n1) These amounts reflect actual cash taxes paid which do not include deferred taxes, but do include foreign withholding taxes.\n2) State income taxes and franchise taxes based on income.\n3) Income taxes paid in Canada, Mexico, China, Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n4) Taxes paid for franchise taxes not based on income in U.S. states and India; Licenses & Permits paid to U.S. states and territories; and duties paid to the U.S., Canada and Mexico on imported products.\n5) Includes all sales taxes and use taxes.\n6) Unemployment taxes; Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) contributions; and federal and state income taxes withheld on behalf of THD associates.\nDATA SECURITY & PRIVACY\n\nWe value and respect the privacy of our customers, associates, service providers and business partners.

As cybersecurity attackers become increasingly more sophisticated, our program prioritizes threat mitigation, while focusing on maintaining the integrity and resiliency of our systems.

Our approach enables us to drive a collectively secure culture.\n\nGovernance, Risk & Compliance\n\n- The Home Depot has a Data Security and Privacy Governance Committee, composed of a cross-functional group of senior leadership, that oversees the strategy and approach in place to manage the security and privacy of customer, associate and business data.\n\n- Information security and privacy policies are in place and are informed by regulatory requirements.
