Visit our [website](https://sustainability.lockheedmartin.com) to learn more.\nAdvancing Resource Stewardship\n\nOur commitment to sustainability includes a responsibility to operate our facilities efficiently and to manage our business and our supply chain effectively to reduce carbon emissions, mitigate risk and safeguard valuable resources.\n\n| Counterfeit Parts Prevention | 9 |\n| Energy Management            | 10 |\n| Hazardous Chemicals/Materials| 14 |\n| Resource and Substance Supply Vulnerability | 15 |\n| Total Cost of Ownership      | 16 |\nCounterfeit Parts Prevention\n\nMission success depends on providing products and services that have trusted reliability, performance and safety. Preventing counterfeit parts from entering Lockheed Martin\u2019s supply chain is one way we uphold this commitment to our customers. To learn more, visit our website.\n\nEducating Our Suppliers on Counterfeit Parts\n\nPersistent challenges to the supply chain have increased the risk of counterfeiting. When shortages or a lack of predictability in parts makes it necessary to buy from others outside of the Original Component Manufacturer (OCM) and/or their authorized distributors, the risk of introducing counterfeits increases dramatically. This year Lockheed Martin\u2019s Global Supply Chain Operations team engaged in communications with all suppliers globally to build awareness and provide guidance on how to minimize the risk.\nEnergy Management\n\nEmissions Reduction\n\nOur Go Green program drives operational improvements by reducing carbon emissions through energy efficiency and use of renewable energy. Investing in capital and operational projects that improve resource efficiency is key to reducing emissions. To learn more, visit our website.\n\nAward-Winning Energy Efficiency Projects\n\nIn 2022, our teams completed 78 energy efficiency projects that resulted in annual savings of 26 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity and 28,000 million British thermal units (MMBtu) of natural gas, and avoided $3.1 million in utility and maintenance costs. Examples of projects completed across our business include LED lighting upgrades, continued steam decentralization and building management system upgrades that enable more efficient operations and maintenance.\n\nThanks to these energy efficiency projects, we earned ENERGY STAR\u00ae certification for six buildings in 2022, making us an official member of Certification Nation, a one-time recognition to celebrate ENERGY STAR\u2019s 30th anniversary. To earn the ENERGY STAR certification, buildings must be independently verified to operate more efficiently than 75% of similar properties nationwide. ENERGY STAR certified buildings use an average of 35% less energy and are responsible for 35% less carbon dioxide emissions than typical buildings. Lockheed Martin was also awarded ENERGY STAR Top Project for an occupancy sensor project at our Grand Prairie, TX, facility that will avoid approximately $193,000 in electricity costs annually and reduce electricity usage by 3.2 million kWh, enough electricity to power approximately 440 homes for one year, according to the ENERGY STAR equivalency calculator.\n\nThis award-winning project is just one example of the dozens of energy efficiency projects completed in 2022.\n\n---\n\n2 We set our ambitious carbon emission reduction target using a methodology established by the Center for Sustainable Organizations to exceed science-based target requirements. The Paris Agreement\u2019s goal is to limit global warming by the end of the century to well below 2\u00b0C of pre-industrial levels and preferably to 1.5\u00b0C. Our carbon emissions target is expected to outperform the Center for Sustainable Organizations model criteria for aligning with a 1.5\u00b0C outcome in the long term.\n\n3 This goal was retired at the end of 2022 and a new goal was released. Visit our website to learn more.\nRenewable Energy\n\nRenewable energy strengthens the resiliency of our facilities, our relationship with our customers and our engagement with employees. Renewable energy is a key facet of our Go Green program, which drives operational improvements by reducing carbon emissions. To learn more, visit our [website](https://sustainability.lockheedmartin.com).\n\nRenewable Energy in Our Global Operations\n\nSince 2008, Lockheed Martin has installed 15 on-site solar systems, for a total of 31.5 megawatts (MW) of capacity. Examples include the 90 kilowatt (kW) and 751 kW solar photovoltaic systems at our Nowra, Australia, and Mielec, Poland, facilities, respectively. The Nowra system provides 30% of the facility\u2019s energy requirements and the Mielec system results in a utility cost savings of $210,000 per year and reduces carbon emissions by 461 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e).\n\n---\n\n4 Via a combination of on-site or off-site generation, and excluding large hydropower in alignment with the Green-e Renewable Energy Standard for Canada and the United States.\n\n5 This goal was retired at the end of 2022, and a new goal was released. Visit our [website](https://sustainability.lockheedmartin.com) to learn more.\nGreen Buildings\n\nGreen buildings reduce our impact on the natural environment, lower life-cycle operating costs and enhance occupant well-being. Lockheed Martin\u2019s corporate policy on green buildings requires the United States Green Building Council\u2019s LEED\u00ae Silver certification as the minimum standard for new construction and major renovations. For existing buildings, we seek ENERGY STAR certification to demonstrate operational energy efficiency. To learn more, visit our website.\n\nFirst LEED Certification for Our Camden, AR, Facility\n\nIn 2022, our Camden, AR, facility received LEED Silver certification for a newly constructed 18,000-square-foot office building. Construction included ENERGY STAR rated equipment, LED lighting, materials with high sustainability ratings, low-emitting materials and environmentally safe construction practices. The design maximizes the use of natural light and air flow, and employs occupancy monitoring to increase the overall efficiency of the building.\nAddressing Climate Risk\n\nLockheed Martin has a multipronged approach to addressing climate risk. We have accelerated our greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction and renewable energy targets, and we continue to pursue innovative carbon removal opportunities. To learn more, visit our website.\n\nUpdated Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures Report\n\nClimate-related risk and opportunity drivers are key considerations for our long-term success and resiliency as a leader in global security and aerospace. We believe it is our responsibility to understand and actively address how those drivers will affect our business. Our Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)-aligned Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities report summarizes Lockheed Martin\u2019s latest climate risk analysis, assessing operational and financial risks to our operations and supply chain.\n\nPartnering with The Nature Conservancy to Support Coastal Resilience\n\nIn 2021, Lockheed Martin committed $2 million to a three-year partnership with The Nature Conservancy in support of a project that will protect 4,000 acres of land along Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore. The project is part of the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration Challenge, which aims to strengthen the resiliency of the DOD\u2019s vital U.S. infrastructure. In 2022, Lockheed Martin\u2019s funding supported The Nature Conservancy\u2019s coastal resiliency efforts and helped establish a pilot Coastal Resilience Easement program. These easements aid in the healthy landward migration of tidal marshes to protect coastal areas while simultaneously preserving landowner cultural and financial interests.\n\nExamples include afforestation, reforestation, direct air capture and habitat restoration.\nHazardous Chemicals/Materials\n\nReducing hazardous chemicals in our products helps Lockheed Martin stay ahead of increasing global chemical regulations and restrictions. Through proactive management of hazardous chemicals in our products and manufacturing processes, we are reducing regulatory risks and protecting our employees, customers and the environment. We are also upholding commitments to our customers and maintaining a competitive position for new business opportunities. To learn more, visit our website.\n\nDesign for Sustainability - Restricted Chemicals Avoidance Tool\n\nOur Design for Sustainability working group, led by employees from Engineering & Technology, collaborates across business areas and functions to develop capabilities that inform product design engineers about restricted chemicals during the product design phase. The working group developed a prototype restricted-chemicals-avoidance tool that will interface with product design tools to help reduce the use of hazardous chemicals by building early awareness into Lockheed Martin\u2019s product design processes. In 2022, this tool was tested and refined through a pilot program with Rotary and Mission Systems and will soon be expanded to other business areas. This tool will help us meet regulatory and customer requirements, reduce risk and costs associated with redesign and increase the sustainability of our products.\n\nIndustry Collaboration\n\nIn 2022, Lockheed Martin continued our active engagement with the International Aerospace Environmental Group (IAEG) in the area of hazardous chemicals and materials. We took on a leadership role in IAEG Work Group 2 - Replacement Technologies, which aims to bring aerospace and defense companies together to reduce the cost and risk of investigation of alternatives to hazardous chemicals and materials. Additionally, Lockheed Martin engineers actively participated on the project teams to provide input into advancing the replacement project efforts for non-chromated alternatives. These actions support both our own efforts and industry-wide efforts across the value chain to deliver more sustainable products.\n\nIndustry Collaboration\n\nAnnually reduce the amount of Lockheed Martin Priority Chemicals used per unit sold of Lockheed Martin\u2019s top five (by sales) programs through 2025.7\n\n2022 PROGRESS\n\nIn 2022, we stood up the Product Chemical Composition Module, which enhances product-level chemical tracking and reporting, in two business areas: Rotary and Mission Systems and Aeronautics. We also increased our participation in industry collaboration efforts to advance available alternatives across the value chain.\n\n7 Lockheed Martin Priority Chemicals are defined as chemical substances that are prohibited from use in Lockheed Martin\u2019s products and processes or cannot be used in new applications or programs and are referenced in our internal corporate policy, Restrictions on the Use of Chemical Substances in Products and Processes. Updates to these lists of chemicals are completed annually. A waiver process is included in the procedure for cases where the Lockheed Martin Priority Chemical cannot be substituted.\nResource and Substance Supply Vulnerability\n\nThe objective of sustainable supply chain management at Lockheed Martin is to ensure the alignment of our supplier\u2019s social, ethical, environmental, safety and health responsibilities with our own sustainability commitments. As a downstream user of critical mineral resources, it is challenging to trace the upstream origins of all of our product components. When we know the origin of the raw materials we depend on, we can make active purchasing decisions to reduce environmental and social risks in our value chain. To learn more, visit our website.\nTotal Cost of Ownership\n\nMaintaining product and service affordability for our customers is crucial to the longevity of our programs. With approximately 60% of product cost coming from our supply chain, the tracking and improvement of savings by our supply chain team contributes to competitive positioning for Lockheed Martin\u2019s future procurement efforts. To learn more, visit our website.\n\nSikorsky CH-53K\u00ae Affordability Efforts\n\nThis year, the Sikorsky supply chain team successfully controlled cost growth on the CH-53K heavy lift helicopter. The team developed new, affordable sources for major components and, at the same time, increased the amount of material bundled across contracts. These efforts mitigated the impact of macroeconomic market conditions while yielding significant savings that will benefit both domestic and international customers for years to come.\nElevating Digital Responsibility\n\nBuilding a reputation for trust and integrity includes a strong commitment to digital responsibility. In an increasingly connected world, we remain committed to safeguarding data and setting standards for the use of artificial intelligence. We provide ongoing training and resources for our employees to support this commitment.\n\n| Artificial Intelligence | 18 |\n|-------------------------|----|\n| Data Privacy and Protection | 19 |\n| Intellectual Property Rights | 22 |\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nLockheed Martin is committed to driving the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in an equitable and transparent way. We are ensuring that our actions have the appropriate defined ethical boundaries at the start to deliver aligned capabilities, meet customer requirements, protect the safety of stakeholders and avoid reputational risk. To learn more, visit our website.\n\nPartnership with Carnegie Mellon University\n\nLockheed Martin continues to partner with Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), a leader in AI and robotics and a partner to both the Pentagon\u2019s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center and the Department of Defense\u2019s Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office. Therefore, CMU was an ideal partner to act as third-party reviewer for our AI ethical principles training materials. CMU provided feedback and validated our proposed training content, ensuring that Lockheed Martin remains at the forefront of ethical AI. Based on CMU\u2019s feedback, we modified our language to create more consumable content for our engineering talent and published enhanced policy language in 2022. Lockheed Martin also partnered with the CMU Software Engineering Institute to update our policy on Ethical Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence to better reflect our position as both consumers and exporters of AI technology.\n\nIndustry Collaboration for Ethical AI\n\nLockheed Martin expanded our engagement with the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 2022 by participating in the Virtuous AI workshop created in partnership with the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA). This workshop meets monthly and includes participants from nine aerospace and defense industry leaders. Lockheed Martin has taken a leadership position in organizing and shaping this community of practice, which encourages collaboration and sharing of best practices. Some key topics covered include assurance cases demonstrating responsible use of AI and AI governance best practices. One outcome of Lockheed Martin\u2019s participation has been the identification of a need for an AI ethics proving ground, where algorithms can be tested and evaluated objectively and compared to other capabilities. DARPA and IDA are now working to make this idea a reality.\nData Privacy and Protection\n\nLockheed Martin empowers employees to take a proactive role in protecting data. From documented privacy policies to annual internal assessments that are supported by a formal network of privacy leaders throughout the enterprise, our corporate privacy program continues to evolve to meet new challenges and address the changing regulatory landscape. For example, new hires complete privacy awareness training as part of the onboarding process, and all employees complete sensitive-information-protection training each year as part of their compliance training plan. In support of this commitment to the protection of data, Lockheed Martin is also focused on expanding data literacy and digital responsibility. To learn more, visit our website.\n\nData Literacy and Data-Centric Practices\n\nIn an increasingly data-driven world, we help Lockheed Martin employees understand their part in protecting, working with, analyzing and communicating with data. We continue to expand data literacy and data-centric practices to empower an interconnected and intelligent data-informed enterprise. We provide the skills employees need to make our business faster and more efficient and to protect the value proposition of our initiatives to increase our competitive advantage. We also leverage data as a strategic asset to communicate more effectively, drive innovation and continue to deliver on our customers\u2019 missions.\nEnvironment, Safety and Health Cohort Learning\n\nIn 2022, our Chief Data & Analytics Office collaborated with the Environment, Safety and Health (ESH) team to create a tailored, 16-week cohort learning experience focused on data literacy, ESH use cases and ESH common systems. Participants used our existing online data learning platform to complete self-paced training and were asked to apply their learnings in their job function each week. This was complemented by weekly live office hours where employees could ask questions and dive deeper into concepts applicable to their roles. These office hours were also used to showcase ESH data-driven efforts within each business area, which stimulated cross-functional collaboration. Examples include best practice sharing on data-driven solutions to injury prevention efforts, such as slip-and-fall hazard mitigation, and cumulative ergonomic risks in multiple work processes.\n\nIntegration of Our Online Data Learning Platform\n\nLockheed Martin\u2019s Enterprise Learning & Development team procured an online learning platform that focuses on data analytics, data science and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) for all skill levels and roles. In 2022, we continued to integrate the new platform into our existing enterprise Atlas Learning platform. This integration allows employees to search for data courses within Atlas Learning and get credit for their training to promote data literacy learning. As of 2022, over 13,000 employees have joined the platform, with active users logging over 30,000 hours of learning this year.\n\nArtificial Intelligence/Machine Learning with Real World Applications\n\nIn 2022 we updated our AI/ML training program, making it more agile. We did this by dividing the program into two parts. The first part of the training is focused on teaching employees about AI/ML to provide a baseline level of knowledge and hands-on capability with theoretical data sets. The second part of the training consists of a capstone project in which employees take a real data problem from their work area and explore potential AI/ML solutions using the knowledge they gained during part one, while being supported by a mentor. The goal of this approach is to bridge the gap between foundational machine learning knowledge and real-world application and encourage the use of AI outside of typical domains of application.\nTier 1 Data\n\nLockheed Martin regards data as a strategic asset and is committed to its responsible governance and management. We are optimizing how we extract value from data by improving interoperability and data quality, while minimizing data sensitivity risk.\n\nTier 1 Data, a set of common and agreed-upon definitions for terms and their data equivalents, is a key aspect supporting our transition to a model-based enterprise. Examples of such defined terms for Lockheed Martin include program, employee, customer and supplier. When we establish common governing definitions for terms, it enables any employee creating data in an information technology system to align to the common definition. Once every system has adopted the definition, we can allow data to move through those systems while experiencing minimal translation issues. Additionally, Tier 1 Data is a significant enabler of digital responsibility because it improves our ability to identify, locate, govern, manage and protect sensitive data.\n\nIn 2022, we identified and finalized a list of Tier 1 Data elements and established preliminary definitions. We then assigned data stewards to each element and kicked off a working group to formalize definitions for all Tier 1 Data identified and set business requirements for these enterprisewide elements. Looking ahead, we have started to explore our data strategy for Tier 2 Data, data governed at the business area level, to facilitate greater cross-functional collaboration.\n\n---\n\n8 As stated in our enterprise reference architecture, a model-based enterprise is an organizational approach that connects and consumes product data seamlessly, eliminating functional and system silos and limiting the usage of transactional systems by leveraging data-rich models.\nIntellectual Property Rights\n\nOur intellectual property Sustainability Management Plan goal is focused on defining and implementing heightened categories of protection for critical types of Lockheed Martin Proprietary Information, which includes the new designations of Restricted Use Only and Restricted Internal Use Only. This increases our ability to protect intellectual property as a business asset and maximize our competitive position. To learn more, visit our website.\n\nThe intellectual property protection processes and policies deployed to support this goal are now used to support corporate engineering functions. They are also accessible to any entity across the enterprise to identify data or information that requires additional safeguards.\n\nOur achievement of this goal enhances data security, reduces the possibility of inadvertent or intentional disclosure and enables the balance of Lockheed Martin interests to protect our critical technology while delivering needed information to our customers.\n\nWe conduct periodic internal reviews to revisit designated categories across all programs to assess whether the information still qualifies for its specific designation or if updates are required. We continuously evaluate and update our processes and policies as the enterprise evolves and remain committed to safeguarding data in all forms.\nFostering Workplace Resiliency\n\nOur people are our greatest asset, and we strive to build a dynamic, engaging, safe and welcoming workplace that drives innovation, embraces diverse perspectives and encourages collaboration. We invest in our employees and cultivate an environment of belonging where people can bring their authentic selves to work every day and have an opportunity to thrive in their roles and beyond.\nHarassment-Free Workplace\n\nLockheed Martin takes pride in our core values to Do What\u2019s Right, Respect Others and Perform with Excellence. These core values are underpinned by our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and corporate policies on Harassment-Free Workplace and Nondiscrimination and Equal Employment Opportunity. We require all employees to complete annual harassment-free workplace training. Additional related training is required for specific employees based on function and level. To learn more, visit our website.\n\nInstructor-Led Trainings\n\nNot only can employees now take the self-paced Upstander Campaign training in Atlas Learning, but their leaders can request instructor-led bystander intervention training for their teams. This training provides a more in-depth education on how to stop or respond to harassment, discrimination, retaliation or other inappropriate conduct. Our goal is to empower our employees to be upstanders in these situations. In 2022, the commitment of our leaders to a harassment-free workplace was demonstrated by the leaders\u2019 requests for instructor-led training, resulting in almost 3,300 employees being trained.\nInclusion and Equity\n\nOur diversity and inclusion strategy is built into the fabric of our core values and is imperative to our success. We know that Lockheed Martin\u2019s diverse and inclusive workforce enhances our collective power and our ability to recognize, value and draw upon unique perspectives and experiences to drive innovation and address our customers\u2019 toughest challenges. Our strategy is underpinned by strong policies, which protect employees and exemplify the inclusive culture we strive to foster. To learn more, visit our website.\n\nInclusive Leadership\n\nOur focus on inclusion training for our leaders began over a decade ago when feedback from employees indicated the opportunity for improvement. We believe inclusive teams produce the best work and are a key building block to a company culture where all employees feel a sense of belonging. Through our robust inclusive learning strategy, we seek to develop key inclusive behaviors in employees and leaders and address employee needs at every level of the organization. As a result, we developed a full suite of trainings and tools to educate our leaders on inclusivity so they can empower employees to reach their full potential, give them the tools they need, create an inclusive culture and reinforce its importance.\n\nINCLUDE Diversity and Inclusion Training\n\nAs part of our four-pronged approach, which aims to build diversity and inclusion capabilities in individuals, teams, leaders and executives, in 2022, we rolled out a new flagship training for U.S.-based people leaders. This new offering complements our existing inclusive training portfolio and offers applied neuroscience concepts as the foundation to develop and promote inclusive behaviors. While some existing trainings, such as Leading Diverse Teams, provide real-world case studies for practicing inclusive behaviors when managing teams, this latest addition to the portfolio offers the scientific theoretical frame for understanding and activating a culture where everybody belongs. This new training has been integrated into our core enterprisewide initiatives, which foster a growth mindset and flexibility to manage hybrid teams and enable Lockheed Martin to become more resilient, innovative and agile.\nWorkforce Diversity\n\nWe actively pursue increasing the number of employees from underrepresented groups in our workforce. While we have made progress, we know that we still have work to do. Representation is one measurement of our progress toward a more diverse and inclusive workforce.

Ms. Lee raised awareness for, and mobilized Lockheed Martin\u2019s commitment to, deepening a culture of inclusion by reminding employees of the history of the emancipation of enslaved people in Texas and the unifying effect of understanding that, \u201cnone of us are free until we are all free.\u201d Ms. Lee recounted the symbolic walking campaign she led at the age of 90 to Washington, D.C., to make Juneteenth a federal holiday.\n\nWorkplace Reasonable Accommodation Process Tool\n\nIn 2022, Lockheed Martin launched the Workplace Reasonable Accommodations Process (WRAP) tool to track and streamline accommodation requests from the initial inquiry to disposition and notification to the employee. WRAP simplifies administration and case management and improves the process for requesting reasonable accommodations. It automates the processes for submitting and reviewing medical and religious accommodation requests and standardizes the accommodation management process. It also helps ensure compliance with Lockheed Martin\u2019s accommodation policies and applicable laws. The WRAP tool helps facilitate the accommodation process consistently across the enterprise and improves the work experience for employees.\n\nInternational Employee Resource Groups\n\nIn 2022, we saw tremendous growth in our international Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). These groups are the international counterparts of our existing U.S.-based Business Resource Groups (BRGs). This year, 11 new ERGs were created in countries such as Colombia, Poland and Canada. We saw particular growth in ERGs focused on our female employees. In Poland, the Women\u2019s Impact Network facilitated its first-ever event titled, \u201cFireside Chat on the Impacts of the War in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nSupporting Veterans\n\nIn 2022, Lockheed Martin\u2019s Military Relations team attended over 100 virtual and in-person military job fairs and networking events across the country, connecting with more than 5,900 job seekers. The Military Relations team continued to expand our veteran recruiting partnerships investing over $120,000 in groups that help veterans with job placement, including Hiring Our Heroes, Student Veterans of America, Service Academy Career Conferences, Corporate Gray and Recruit Military. Additionally, our Social Impact team donated $250,000 to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation\u2019s Hiring Our Heroes for its Corporate Fellowship and Military Spouse Fellowship programs. Our BRG for veterans, Military Veteran, held its 11th annual Leadership Forum which focused on such topics as mentoring veterans and mental health.\nWorkplace Safety\n\nThe Lockheed Martin Safety and Health program goes beyond compliance to optimize Lockheed Martin operations through targeted safety, health and wellness opportunities designed to ensure safe work conditions, a healthy work environment, promote workforce resiliency and enhance business value. We make a difference, together with our stakeholders to integrate, enable and instill core safety and health competencies for workplace design, work practices and for workers to ensure successful implementation of the corporation\u2019s mission. To learn more, visit our website.\n\nTarget Zero Leader Program\n\nOur Target Zero (TZ) Leader program continues to inspire leaders to engage with employees on the important topics of safety and employee well-being as high leader engagement has been shown to generate safer and more resilient employees, resulting in better business outcomes. In 2022, to assist in promoting leader engagement, we rolled out an initiative to encourage leaders to hold a safety moment at the beginning of each meeting. These \u201cMeeting Safety Moments\u201d are housed within a repository of health and safety messages created for leaders to focus purposeful, tailorable discussions with their teams. Leaders then log their efforts in the TZ Leader mobile or desktop application and receive recognition for their milestone achievements based on the number of activities they complete. To encourage participation in this program, all leaders are sent a weekly reminder email and receive a monthly safety moment achievement summary. Leaders can also use the app to reward employees for their Target Zero efforts.\n\nCelebrating 10 Years of Ergo Cup\n\nWe held our 10th annual Lockheed Martin Ergo Cup competition in 2022. This competition fosters innovation of new ergonomic practices and processes to minimize ergonomic stressors experienced in the workplace. Individuals, teams, departments, facilities and business areas are encouraged to submit ergonomic innovations that have been designed and implemented. In 2022, the winning project was submitted by our Manassas, VA, Rotary and Mission Systems facility. The team proposed an innovative solution to a production process that posed a tremendous ergonomic risk for employees. By employing an autonomous mobile robot with a grounded cart, the solution eliminated manual lifting and provided several other efficiencies that streamline the process and improve safety.\n\n9 Lost days severity rate is calculated as a function of the number of days away from work due to an injury or illness per 100 employees.\n10 The 2022 severity rate without occupational COVID illnesses was 4.00, which was within goal. The 2022 severity rate including occupational COVID illness was 5.45. No other identified trends impacted our 2022 performance. The 2021 severity rate without occupational COVID illnesses was 5.81. No other identified trends impacted our 2021 performance.\n11 Since its initiation in 2004, the Lockheed Martin Target Zero program has focused employees and leaders in the direction of injury prevention to protect our most important asset: our people. Our approach to drive improvement encompasses education, leader accountability and employee engagement through a variety of safety and health programs and initiatives.\nModeling Business Integrity\n\nEarning and maintaining the trust of our stakeholders is essential to our business. We are proud of our culture of integrity and work to create an environment that supports ethical behavior and empowers employees to speak up with concerns. We are deeply committed to doing business the right way and strive to strengthen our programs to ensure our employees and anyone who works with us adheres to the same high ethical standards.\nEthical Business Practices\n\nA core component of an effective ethics program is ensuring employees feel empowered to raise concerns to their leader or Ethics Officer for guidance or to report potential misconduct. Promptly responding to concerns promotes trust and accountability in the workplace. Lockheed Martin\u2019s sustained reputation for ethical conduct instills confidence in our customers and suppliers and helps attract and retain high-quality employees whose values and integrity align with the company.

Hermes Awards recognize excellence for the concept, writing and design of traditional materials and programs and emerging technologies. In 2022, we also received a Bronze \u201cStevie\u201d from American Business Awards for our Integrity Minute 51-video series, \u201cCall Me by My Name,\u201d about diversity and inclusion.\n\nEthics in Engineering Case Competition\n\nLockheed Martin hosted our fifth annual Ethics in Engineering Case Competition virtually in 2022. Twenty-four colleges and universities competed by presenting solutions to a fictional scenario involving ethical, business and engineering dilemmas. This event helps students focus on the importance of integrity in the workplace as dilemmas arise in the fast-paced world of technology. This year\u2019s top teams included the U.S. Air Force Academy, the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, the University of Florida, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the U.S. Naval Academy and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.\n\n\\textsuperscript{a} Ethics contact requests for an Ethics Officer to provide guidance or to investigate misconduct.\n\\textsuperscript{b} Ethics guidance information, advice or resources to clarify policy and resolve workplace questions on a wide-range of ethics and compliance topics.\n\\textsuperscript{c} Ethics case internal investigation into a good-faith allegation of misconduct.\n\\textsuperscript{d} Investigation feedback score perspectives of reporting party and subjects on the ethics investigative process.\nAnti-Bribery and Corruption\n\nAt Lockheed Martin, we have zero tolerance for bribery and corruption. We will walk away from business engagements associated with improper conduct and that would violate U.S. and other applicable anti-corruption laws. To learn more, visit our website.\n\nInternational Anti-Corruption\n\nAt Lockheed Martin, thousands of employees are deployed on global assignments each year. When stationed away from their home country, the risk of being exposed to potential misconduct or potential corruption is higher. This is due, in part, to operating within different cultural contexts and local laws, and interacting with individuals who may conduct business differently or even illegally.\n\nAs such, Lockheed Martin has formulated a life cycle approach to provide training and resources to ensure deployed personnel know how to respond if confronted with an issue that could potentially be a violation of our zero tolerance anti-corruption policy. This approach includes training courses, partnering with Lockheed Martin\u2019s Global Emergency Operations Center to provide ongoing communications, utilizing our Traveler\u2019s Suitcase portal and frequent outreach to provide a steady stream of engagement while deployed.\n2022 ESG Performance Index\n\nOur ESG Performance Index contains relevant environmental, social and governance metrics to support the efforts highlighted throughout our sustainability performance report.
