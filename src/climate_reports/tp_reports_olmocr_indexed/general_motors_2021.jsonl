In some instances, data has been included for operations in which GM\u2019s interest is through joint ventures, including our automotive China joint ventures. In these instances, the inclusion of that data is noted. Dollar amounts presented within this report are stated in U.S. dollars. This report was published on April 28, 2022.\n\nWe annually contract an independent third-party verification of a selection of greenhouse gas (GHG) and certain sustainability data assertions for our global operations. The verification statements and applicable data assertions can be found in the 2021 Sustainability Supplement.\n\nThis report provides an overview of some of GM\u2019s long-term goals and aspirations, and efforts in support of those goals and aspirations. Some material is derived from other company documents, and links are provided to those documents where appropriate. With respect to goals, commitments and aspirational or otherwise forward-looking statements in this report, actual results may differ, possibly materially. The report also includes certain numbers that are estimates or approximations and that may be based on assumptions. We believe that the estimates employed are appropriate and reasonable; however, due to inherent uncertainties in making estimates and assumptions, actual results could differ from the original estimates. Additional information with respect to forward-looking statements can be found on page 120.

Additionally, certain products are not currently available or are subject to limited availability. For vehicle availability and feature use and limitations, including details relating to advanced safety and driver assistance features, consult the vehicle\u2019s Owner\u2019s Manual and brand\u2019s website.\nEarlier this year, I took a driverless ride through San Francisco in a fully electric Cruise autonomous vehicle (AV). It was one of the most inspiring moments of my career, and it reinforced my belief that our opportunity to change the world has never been clearer or closer.\n\nDuring a challenging 2021, a resilient and focused GM team continued to make significant progress toward our vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion.\n\nOur culture of innovation, which begins with our employees, is unlocking once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to create a better and safer future for all.\n\nWe delivered to customers the GMC HUMMER EV supertruck and BrightDrop Zevo 600 van, the first-ever electric vehicles (EVs) featuring our Ultium platform, and we have since announced the Chevrolet Silverado EV and Chevrolet Equinox crossover EV\u2014with many more to follow. Production of the sold-out Debut Edition of the Cadillac LYRIQ SUV is underway in Tennessee, and next month we will begin accepting orders for the next editions. Cruise is now at the cusp of commercializing accessible and zero-emissions ride-hailing services.\n\nOur transition to EVs and AVs is at the heart of our technology- and software-driven growth strategy. We will continue to increase our investments in these vehicles and new services as we progress toward decarbonizing our business.\n\nIn fact, we are accelerating our work this year to meet increasing demand for our EVs. We are expanding our global EV manufacturing capacity to over 2 million vehicles by the end of 2025. Half of that will be in North America, where we have set a target to produce 400,000 EVs over the next 24 months\u2014with the ultimate goal of becoming the EV market leader.\n\nOur commitments and investments reflect our sense of urgency to get everybody in an EV, and transform our vision into a reality. It\u2019s also imperative that this future be inclusive, including our diverse Board, our workforce and our business partners. Industry-leading innovations like Ultium and Cruise are possible because of a culture at GM that encourages and values diverse ideas and perspectives. As part of our aspiration to be the world\u2019s most inclusive company, we have also launched an internal Inclusivity Index to measure our progress, and we use the results to inform future actions.\n\nThe brighter and more inclusive future we envision also extends to the communities where we live, work and play. Last year, to meet unique community needs, we provided more than $85 million in cash and in-kind donations to hundreds of local nonprofit partners, with a focus on education, skills and literacy training, climate equity programs and road safety.\n\nI am excited about the progress we are making toward reimagining how our customers and communities will move through the world, just as we did more than a century ago. I invite you to learn more in this report, and see why I am so optimistic about the road ahead.\n\nMary T. Barra\nChair and CEO\nPowering Growth With Purpose\n\nWe pioneer the innovations that move and connect people to what matters\n\nGeneral Motors is in the midst of a transformation that includes our accelerated transition to EVs and AVs. We are rethinking how and, in many cases, where we work. We are taking bold actions to make our business carbon neutral, and we are broadening our social impact by aiming to help create a zero-emissions future that is both inclusive and equitable. We are also laser-focused on our aspiration to become the most inclusive company in the world. For these reasons, the timing felt right to revisit the question of why we exist and to crystallize and articulate our Purpose.\n\nAfter extensive work by the Board, our Senior Leadership Team and a diverse, cross-functional global team of colleagues, we recently introduced our Purpose statement to our full team. For each and every one of us at General Motors, it\u2019s the answer to why we exist: We pioneer the innovations that move and connect people to what matters. It\u2019s a simple but powerful statement that honors our heritage of innovation, captures who we are today when we\u2019re at our best and looks ahead. By defining our Purpose, it\u2019s much easier to keep it front and center.\n\nBehaviors\n\nOur eight GM behaviors are the foundation of our culture and how we think and act in service of our Purpose.\n\n- **BE INCLUSIVE**\n  I create moments every day that value backgrounds, opinions and ideas that may be different than my own.\n\n- **THINK CUSTOMER**\n  I consider the customers\u2019 needs in everything I do.\n\n- **INNOVATE NOW**\n  I see things not as they are but as they could be.\n\n- **LOOK AHEAD**\n  I make decisions now with the long-term view in mind, and I anticipate what lies ahead.\n\n- **ONE TEAM**\n  I collaborate cross-functionally to achieve enterprisewide results.\n\n- **BE BOLD**\n  I respectfully speak up, exchange feedback and boldly share ideas without fear.\n\n- **IT\u2019S ON ME**\n  I take accountability for safety and my own actions, behaviors and results.\n\n- **WIN WITH INTEGRITY**\n  I have a relentless desire to win and do it with integrity.\nHow GM Creates Value\n\nThe needs of our customers are at the forefront of every decision we make. Today, we\u2019re working to leverage our core business strengths to find new market opportunities that solve challenges for both individual customers and society at large. For example, we leveraged our Ultium battery platform to launch BrightDrop, which is focused on developing and commercializing smarter ways to deliver goods and services. And, Cruise is developing autonomous robo-taxis that we believe will reduce congestion in cities and improve safety.\n\nOur Vision\n\n- **ZERO** crashes,\n- **ZERO** emissions and\n- **ZERO** congestion\n\nOur Growth Strategy\n\nThis diagram shows an illustrative overview of some of GM\u2019s performance indicators and is not meant to be inclusive of all key performance indicators (KPIs); rather, it is an example of how GM creates value for our stakeholders. Details on KPIs can be found in each of the corresponding sections.\n2021 Sustainability Highlights\n\n- **2040**: Carbon neutral goal by 2040 and Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) approved targets for operations and products.\n- **$35B+**: Planned investment from 2020 to 2025 in EVs and AVs.\n- **$7B**: Announced investment in four Michigan manufacturing sites for a significant expansion of battery cell and EV assembly capacity in the United States.\n- **$50M**: In early 2022, we doubled our Climate Equity Fund pledge to help ensure the people and communities most affected by climate change are not left behind.\n- **50%**: Manufacturing footprint in North America and China to be capable of EV production by 2030.\n- **1M+**: Planned units of EV capacity in each of North America and China by 2025.\n- **2035**: Announced plan to eliminate tailpipe emissions from all new light-duty vehicles by 2035.\n- **100%**: Plan to source 100% renewable electricity at sites in the United States by 2025 and globally by 2035.\n- **$750M**: Planned investment of nearly $750 million through 2025 to expand access to EV charging in the United States and Canada.\n- **Zevo 600**: Delivered first all-electric delivery vans, with the Zevo 600 being the fastest vehicle to market in GM history.\n- **5K**: Expected to create 4,000 new jobs and retain 1,000 jobs in four Michigan manufacturing sites.\n- **EEO-1**: Published consolidated EEO-1 data for the first time.\n- **100K+**: Ultium Charge 360 enables access, using GM mobile apps, to more than 100,000 charging plugs throughout the United States and Canada.\n\n2021 Recognitions\n\n- Placed on the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index (GEI) 4th year in a row.\n- Diversity Inc Top 50 Companies for Diversity 6 years in a row.\n- Member of Dow Jones Sustainability Indices.\n- Ranked 2nd among top U.S. auto companies in 2022.\n- CDP Climate and Water Security A List 3rd year in a row.\n- 2022 World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies\u00ae 3rd year in a row and the only automotive original equipment manufacturer to be recognized on the list.\nOur Climate Action Framework for an Equitable Transition\n\nOur future is electric and includes everyone.\n\nClimate change affects different communities in different ways. As we move toward a carbon neutral future, we must lead positive change and implement inclusive solutions that address everyone\u2019s unique needs, especially those of the communities where we live and work. In 2021, we put forth a Climate Action Framework to help guide our actions as our industry and company undergo a fundamental shift in mobility.\n\nBuilding on our philanthropic commitment to equitable climate action, GM has announced that we will provide an additional $25 million through our Climate Equity Fund, dedicating a total of $50 million to help close equity gaps in the transition to EVs and other sustainable technologies. To date, grants have been made to 19 nonprofit organizations that are helping to implement inclusive solutions for a zero-emissions, carbon neutral future. Read more about GM\u2019s impact through the Climate Equity Fund on page 101.\n\nFOCUS AREAS\n\nFuture of Work\nCurrent and future employees will have a role to play in GM\u2019s transition to an EV portfolio, and we will invest in necessary training and reskilling to make that transition.\n\nEV Access\nAchieve through a wide range of EVs across most segments and price points.\n\nInfrastructure Equity\nCommitting to accessible charging solutions that can help meet customers where they are and understanding the need to help address charging deserts and other scenarios that can hinder EV ownership.\n\nClimate Equity\nFunding organizations that are helping to close the climate equity gap at the community level.\n\nPRINCIPLES\n\n\u2022 Help make mobility safe, accessible and environmentally friendly for all.\n\u2022 Incorporate and normalize equity considerations across our business operations and program implementation efforts, including workforce strategy, sustainability efforts, and products and services.\n\u2022 Work with community-based stakeholders to identify their unique needs, assets and priorities as well as collaboratively assist impacted communities.\n\n\u2022 Advocate for inclusive and equitable climate change action, renewable energy and transportation-related policies at the federal, state and local levels.\n\u2022 Help support organizations that are providing equitable access to a more sustainable future.\nSustainability Strategy\n\nGM\u2019s sustainability strategy is led at the enterprise level to ensure a holistic approach across the company.\n\nSustainability is overseen by the Board. GM\u2019s sustainability strategy is led by senior leaders throughout the organization. Our chief sustainability officer is the enterprisewide leader of sustainability and directs initiatives through the Office of Sustainability. The Office of Sustainability has been strategically designed to ensure accountability for key sustainability targets and initiatives at the highest levels of the company; nurture a culture of sustainability across the organization; track and measure progress through transparent disclosure; and engage with both internal and external stakeholders on relevant matters. The Office of Sustainability leaders are charged with innovating and advocating as well as supporting social responsibility and transparent corporate practices.\n\nOur Sustainability Office uses a \u201cteam of teams\u201d approach to help ensure that functional areas across the enterprise have accountability for their respective functions\u2019 role in accelerating the company\u2019s vision. Within each functional area, a single leader represents sustainability objectives and priorities, and owns sustainability goals and metrics. The teams focus on environmental and social aspects of sustainability. For example, a representative from engineering who sources cobalt for battery development works with the representative from supply chain to help ensure cobalt is sourced through strategic partnerships in an ethical manner that respects human rights.\n\nSustainability Priority Assessment\n\nWe prioritize sustainability topics by engaging with our stakeholders to understand those topics most relevant to them and our business, and those that offer the greatest opportunity to create meaningful shared value. This process is formally conducted through an assessment, and we performed our most recent assessment in 2021. We plan to conduct similar assessments every two to three years so that it takes into account emerging sustainability issues, macro events and current dynamics in the world around us.\n\nWe performed our assessment in collaboration with a third party who guided us through a four-part process aligned with the GRI materiality principle for sustainability reporting.\n\n1. Identify a list of sustainability topics relevant to GM and the automotive industry.\n2. Understand stakeholder perspectives and priorities through an internal survey of more than 100 GM employees as well as 40 interviews with internal and external stakeholders.\n3. Score the topics based on quantitative and qualitative inputs.\n4. Prioritize the topics through the development of a tiered matrix as shown on the next page.\nThe placement of priorities within three categories reflects a number of different stakeholder perspectives. The assessment identified six topics as highest priority and therefore urgent for the company to manage. Some topics were not deemed as urgent because stakeholders and management view them as a GM strength today. As an example, we have been working on operational waste, water and energy since 2010 and have robust management systems with a track record of performance in these areas. Still other priorities, such as autonomous technology and the associated ethics around it, are seen more as emerging issues that are likely to grow in importance over time.\n\nThrough both the qualitative and quantitative inputs, several stakeholder themes emerged:\n\n- The safety of employees and vehicles remains a top priority and strength for GM as our business model shifts.\n- A changing and inclusive employee landscape calls for GM to focus on an equitable transition to an all-electric future that brings along all employees and customers around the world.\n- There is high ambition at GM. Both internal and external stakeholders are very supportive of the company\u2019s vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion.\n- There is an imperative for standardizing the EV ecosystem, underscoring the intersection of such priorities as Product GHG Emissions and EV Infrastructure.\n- Responsible innovation should occur across the value chain as new advanced technologies create new business opportunities.\n\n### Sustainability Priority Matrix\n\nTopics are listed in alphabetical order within each priority category and do not represent specific ranking within the category.\n\n| Priority | High Priority | Highest Priority |\n|----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Biodiversity & Ecosystem Health | Autonomous Technology & Ethics | Business Ethics |\n| Community Development | Circular Economy | Climate Risk & Resilience |\n| Freedom of Association & Expression | Cybersecurity | Diversity, Equity & Inclusion |\n| Operational GHG Emissions & Efficiency | Employee Health & Well-Being | EV Infrastructure |\n| STEM Education | Employee Recruitment, Engagement & Development | Product GHG Emissions |\n| Supplier Diversity | Supply Chain Environmental Impacts | Vehicle Safety |\n| Supply Chain Labor Conditions | Sustainability-Related Compensation & Incentives | Responsible Use of Data |\n| Tax Payments | Waste Management | Socially Responsible Innovation |\n| Water Management | | |\nAs climate transition strategies continue to make headlines, the focus on social issues is also on the rise. How is GM working to address an equitable transition?\n\nWe know that, across the globe, no two communities are impacted by climate change in the same way. Last year, we announced our Equitable Climate Action initiative to ensure that our transition to an all-electric, carbon neutral future is an inclusive one for our current and future workforce, customers and communities that may be more likely to disproportionately experience the effects of climate change. This initiative is rooted in four key areas: the future of work, EV access, infrastructure equity and climate equity.\n\nIt\u2019s a fact that the realities of climate change aren\u2019t the same in every community\u2014and that means the solutions can\u2019t be the same either. As we move to a carbon neutral future, it is on us to lead positive change and implement inclusive solutions that bring everyone along.\n\nWhat have been your priorities in your first year as CSO? Where do you intend to focus your efforts?\n\nIn my first year as CSO, my priority has been to ensure our sustainability strategy connects to our overall corporate vision. Our commitment to a vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion positions us to become a leader in the industry. As we implement our growth strategy, we have an opportunity\u2014and an obligation\u2014to create a better future for everyone.\n\nThe pursuit of a safe and sustainable world is a passionate movement within GM; one that\u2019s gaining momentum as our technologies reveal their increasingly profound potential. As a leader, an engineer and a mom, I am here to help break down barriers and advance our plans toward creating a world with zero emissions for generations to come.\n\nWhat are the most critical challenges we are facing as an industry as we transition to all-electric vehicles, and how are we working toward achieving our carbon neutral ambition?\n\nAnnouncing our vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion has led to important business growth and innovation\u2014primarily in our AVs and EVs. We have put in place a cohesive strategy and set science-based targets aligned with the Paris Agreement. Our goals include a plan to introduce more than 30 EV models globally by 2025, become carbon neutral in our global products and operations by 2040 and source 100% renewable electricity at sites in the United States by 2025 and globally by 2035.\n\nOne of the most critical challenges we face is that we cannot reach the future we envision alone\u2014we must continue to pursue opportunities for collaboration with stakeholders across the globe, including suppliers, dealers, policymakers, climate thought leaders and others. A shift this massive requires everybody in, working together toward a single goal\u2014an inclusive, all-electric future.\n\nBecause talent and recruitment have never been more important, how is GM fostering a culture of inclusion and integrating sustainability across the enterprise?\n\nWhen our CEO, Mary Barra, announced our ambition to be the most inclusive company in the world, it was intended to reflect our approach to shaping our own workplace culture, as well as how we want to impact the world on the journey to a more sustainable future.\n\nOur path to innovation starts and ends with our employees, who are fundamental to the vibrancy and success of our company. That is why we have established employee development programs that address both individual and business needs, as well as effective recruitment programs that reach out to diverse populations. In addition, we are continuing to evolve our hiring and employee engagement practices to attract, engage and develop critical skills and best-in-class talent with diverse backgrounds and experiences.\n## Our Priorities\n\nOur topic areas reflect the priorities identified through our Sustainability Priority Assessment.

The SBTi standards require well-to-wheel (from fuel production to vehicle driving) for vehicle CO2 intensity (gCO2/km) calculations. We have revised our numbers for 2018 through 2020 for this requirement. Going forward, GM will use the SBTi standards in calculating vehicle CO2 intensity.\n\n2 Includes other Scope 3 categories.\nAccelerating an Inclusive All-Electric Future\n\nClimate change needs to be addressed, and we want to be part of the solution by putting everyone in an EV.\n\nWe accelerated our plans to transition to an all-electric future in 2021 when we announced increased investments in EV and autonomous vehicle (AV) development to more than $35 billion from 2020 through 2025 from our initial target of $20 billion.\n\nWe also announced plans to introduce more than 30 EVs globally by the end of 2025, with more than two-thirds of these available in North America. These introductions, along with additional EVs being planned, should position us to have EVs represent 40% to 50% of annual U.S. sales volume by 2030. To reach this upper range, we will continue to work with federal, state and local governments for implementation of supportive policies to move the United States closer to carbon neutrality consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn China, the world\u2019s largest EV market, we will accelerate electrification through a plan in which 40% of new vehicles introduced through the end of 2025 will be EVs. This will build on our current market momentum in China.\n\nBased on our planned cadence of EV introductions, by the end of 2025, GM will have more than 1 million units of EV capacity in North America. This is in addition to more than 1 million units of EV capacity in China over the same time frame. Our EV portfolio is planned to be among the broadest in the industry with entries from affordable, high-volume market segments to top-of-the-line models and everything in between. The new all-electric GMC HUMMER EV and upcoming Cadillac LYRIQ, Chevrolet Silverado EV and Chevrolet Equinox EV feature the company\u2019s Ultium platform, a combined EV architecture and propulsion system, which enables EVs at scale, across a broad set of lifestyles and price points.\n\nEVGRO is our dedicated team leading efforts to drive mass consumer adoption of EVs.

See dealer for details.\nLeveraging the Ultium Platform\n\nOur EV strategy leverages a highly flexible global EV platform powered by our proprietary Ultium propulsion system.\n\nGM\u2019s Ultium-based EVs are powered by rectangular, pouch-style battery cells that are simple, lightweight and space-efficient. Our ability to stack the long pouch cells vertically or horizontally is unique in the industry and allows for a flat cabin floor and more interior room than comparable EVs that use cylindrical battery packs. This platform can power mobility across a broad range of price points from luxury vehicles to work trucks to high-performance vehicles. As a result, Ultium is enabling GM to compete on an entirely new level and pursue nearly every customer type and preference in the market.\n\nIn 2021, we increased our vertical integration of key supply chains to accelerate technology adoption, drive down costs and mitigate supply chain risks. One of these initiatives includes next-generation silicon carbide devices that will be used in the integrated power electronics contained within Ultium Drive units in next-generation EVs. The device enables system efficiencies while lowering weight and conserving space. We also are working to reduce supply chain risks by improving supplies of heavy and light rare earth materials and magnets, copper and electrical steel\u2014all critical components used in the manufacturing of electric motors for automotive and renewable power generation. As an example, we are forming a strategic relationship and commercial collaboration with Controlled Thermal Resources to secure local and low-cost lithium from the Salton Sea area of California. This lithium will be produced through a closed-loop, direct extraction process that results in a smaller physical footprint, no production tailing and lower carbon emissions when compared to traditional processes like pit mining or evaporation ponds. Importantly, the agreement positions us to source lithium through a U.S. supplier. These initiatives help us ensure availability of critical materials, drive supply chain innovation and, ultimately, deliver both higher-quality and more affordable vehicles to our customers.\n\nLearn More about our Battery Chemistry\n\nUltium: A Revolutionary EV Platform\n\nBuilt on a flexible battery architecture for the production of EVs across different vehicle types with outstanding power, range and performance.\n\n300+ miles\nGM-estimated range of up to 300+ miles.\n\n10 minutes\nLevel 2 and direct current (DC) fast charging with the capability to charge nearly 100 miles of range in 10 minutes.\n\n50 to 200 kWh\nBattery energy storage ranging from 50 to 200 kWh.\n\nUltim Drive\nUltium Drive units to support front-wheel, rear-wheel, all-wheel and performance all-wheel drive applications.\n\n~3 seconds\nGM-estimated acceleration of 0 to 60 mph in as little as approximately 3 seconds on the GMC Hummer EV.\n\n1 Actual range will vary based on several factors, including temperature, terrain, battery age, loading, use and maintenance.\n2 GM-estimated.

Globally, we are adding battery assembly/pack facilities to our existing sites in North America and China and converting some propulsion facilities to the manufacturing of drive units.\n\nSince 2020, we have announced investments totaling more than $14 billion in 10 sites across North America to increase our manufacturing capacity in the region to more than 1 million EVs annually by the end of 2025. This is a key step to deliver on our target to achieve carbon neutrality in our global products and operations by 2040.\n\nWe believe that leveraging established assembly plants for EV production reduces capital expenditures up to $1.5 billion per assembly plant versus building an all-new plant and enables us to go into vehicle production in less than half the time required of a greenfield plant.\n\nGM is investing $7 billion in four Michigan manufacturing sites, significantly increasing battery cell and electric truck manufacturing capacity. This is the single largest investment announcement in GM history. The investment includes construction of a new Ultium Cells battery cell plant in Lansing, Michigan and the conversion of GM\u2019s assembly plant in Orion Township, Michigan for production of the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the electric GMC Sierra, GM\u2019s second assembly plant scheduled to build full-size electric pickups.\n\nIn 2021, we also announced the Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center, an all-new facility is expected to significantly expand our battery technology operations and accelerate the development and commercialization of longer-range, more affordable EV batteries. The Center, located at our Global Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, is slated to be completed in mid-2022. The latest addition of 50,000 square feet brings the Center to 85,000 total square feet as demand for EVs increases.\n\nBy the end of 2025, GM plans to have more than 1 million units of EV capacity in North America. This is in addition to more than 1 million units of EV capacity in China over the same time frame.\n\nOur manufacturing investments in four Michigan manufacturing sites are expected to create 4,000 new jobs and retain 1,000 jobs in Michigan.\n\nInvesting in an All-Electric Future\n\n(Projects completed, in progress or announced through the first quarter of 2022 in the United States as examples of our transformation)\n\nBattery Cell Manufacturing\nLansing, Michigan\nNew $2.6 billion plant to supply battery cells to Orion and other GM assembly plants.\n\nFactory ZERO\nDetroit Hamtramck, Michigan\nRetooling of existing manufacturing facility, representing a $2.3 billion investment.\n\nElectric Motor Component Plant\nLockport, New York\nRenovation and new equipment installation, a $154 million investment.\n\nEV Truck Assembly\nOrion, Michigan\nRetooling of existing manufacturing facility through a $4 billion investment.\n\nEV Assembly\nSpring Hill, Tennessee\nA $2.3 billion retooling of an existing manufacturing facility.\n\nBattery Cell Manufacturing\nLordstown, Ohio\nA $2.3 billion investment to mass-produce Ultium battery cells.\n\nDie Casting Foundry\nBedford, Indiana\nMore than $51 million invested to support drive unit castings for Silverado EV.\n\n1 Built through Ultium Cells LLC (an equally owned joint venture with LG Energy Solution)\nFactory ZERO: How Our Future Looks\n\nWalk through the doors of Factory ZERO in Detroit, Michigan, and you\u2019ll not only see the launchpad for GM\u2019s multibrand EV strategy but also GM\u2019s low carbon future.

For example, the 4WD Crew Cab Silverado has seen an improvement in tailpipe CO2 emissions of 25% from 2000 through 2020.3\n\nWithin GM, we have institutionalized extensive governance processes that predict, plan, measure and assess our fleet\u2019s fuel efficiency and emissions performance according to established government test procedures on a dynamic and country-by-country basis.\n\nWell-to-Wheel CO2 Emissions per Light-Duty Vehicle1, 2\n\n|          | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|----------|------|------|------|\n| USA      | 287  | 293  | 280  |\n| China    | 220  | 208  | 206  |\n| Brazil   | 200  | 198  | 195  |\n| Weighted Average | 245  | 243  | 240  |\n\nU.S. Light-Duty Fuel Economy Technologies Across the Fleet\n\nPercent of Total U.S. Light-Duty Volume\n\n- **Stop-Start** (reduces fuel usage when the vehicle is stopped)\n  - 74% MY21\n\n- **Aero-Shutter** (reduces aerodynamic drag)\n  - 83% MY21\n\n- **Engine/Transmission Thermal Management** (warms up engine and transmission faster to reduce friction and losses)\n  - 56% MY21\n\n- **High-Efficiency Alternators (72%+)** (reduce losses from electricity generation)\n  - 88% MY21\n\n---\n\n1 2021 data will be available mid-2022.\n2 Data has been restated to align with SBTi for Scope 3, Use of Sold Products. The SBTi standards require well-to-wheel (from fuel production to vehicle driving) for vehicle CO2 intensity (gCO2e/km) calculations. We have revised our numbers for 2018 through 2020 for this requirement. Going forward, GM will use the SBTi standards in calculating vehicle CO2 intensity. Numbers are inclusive of EV portfolio.\n3 Data prior to July 2009 corresponds to General Motors Corporation.\nConserving Energy in Our Facilities\n\nOur goal to become carbon neutral in our operations will be achieved in part through an ambitious energy conservation and renewable energy program.\n\nAn important pillar in GM\u2019s carbon reduction strategy for Scope 1 & 2 emissions is to focus on energy efficiency. Globally, our plants continue to work on improving energy efficiency and reducing GHG emissions through the use of an energy management system (EnMS). In addition to our Science-Based Target goal for GHG emissions, GM expanded our energy intensity goal for operations to 2035 with a 35% reduction from a 2010 baseline. Following are some of the programs and strategies that we deploy to conserve energy in our operations.\n\nU.S. DOE 50001 Ready Program\nIn 2021, 27 GM U.S. manufacturing facilities, or 93% of our U.S. manufacturing footprint, implemented the U.S. DOE 50001 Ready program. GM has implemented 50001 Ready at 27 manufacturing and two nonmanufacturing facilities\u2014more than any other participating company. In 2021, we expanded the program to two nonmanufacturing sites in the United States, two plants in Canada and one in Mexico. We plan to expand this program to all manufacturing facilities globally to continuously monitor and improve our EnMS.\n\nBetter Buildings Low Carbon Pilot\nWe are participating in the DOE Better Buildings program to demonstrate pathways to achieve low or zero carbon in the operation of buildings and manufacturing plants.\n\nEnergy Star\u2019s Building Portfolio Manager (BPM)\nGM uses data analytics to measure and track energy consumption globally. BPM is an example of a tool that allows us to benchmark performance and make continuous improvements.\n\n2021 Energy Star Certifications for Superior Energy Management\n- IT Innovation Centers in Texas and Arizona\n- Enterprise Data Centers (2) in Michigan\n- Flint Assembly\n- Fort Wayne Assembly\n\nGM Energy Strategy\n\nIncreasing Energy Efficiency\nReduce energy consumption at our facilities.\n\nSourcing Renewables\nSource through direct investments, green tariffs and power purchase agreements.\n\nAddressing Intermittency\nMitigate against gaps in renewable energy for electricity transmission.\n\nPolicy Advocacy\nWork to drive down costs and increase renewable energy for electricity opportunities.\n\nGoal: Plan to source 100% renewable electricity at sites in the United States by 2025 and globally by 2035.\nEnergy Star Challenge for Industry\n\nThis continuous improvement program has recognized 69 GM plants multiple times over the past 10 years for a total of 130 recognitions. The Challenge is to reduce energy intensity by 10% within a five-year period. In 2021, five plants met the Challenge with an average 15% reduction over three years. The five plants were Qingdao Assembly, Baojun Assembly and Dongyue Engine, all in China, Silao Assembly in Mexico and Flint Assembly in the United States.\n\nEnergy Star certifications provide a benchmark system for energy efficiency, identifying buildings and auto assembly plants within the top 25th percentile of operating efficiency.\n\nEnergy Star Treasure Hunts\n\nThrough this process, we can engage nearly 100 team members to uncover quick ways to save energy. In 2021, we conducted 17 on-site and virtual energy treasure hunts, covering 61 million square feet of space, and found 175 opportunities that could potentially save the company $5 million. We also extended this approach to our suppliers during the year, including rolling out a Virtual Energy Treasure Hunt process. Learn more in Supporting Supplier Responsibility.\n\nEnergy OnStar\n\nThis tool (unrelated to GM\u2019s OnStar service), is a continuous commissioning system that monitors the performance of our HVAC equipment in real time. Approximately one-third of our operational energy use is heating and cooling, and the system allows us to quickly identify when a unit is malfunctioning and easily find opportunities for improvement. The Energy OnStar tool helped us optimally manage plant shutdowns in 2021 during the semiconductor shortage.\n\nA More Energy-Efficient Plant\n\nOne of our energy efficiency projects in 2021 was at Fort Wayne Assembly, where we manufacture the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size trucks. The 35-year-old plant generated steam with large natural gas boilers to heat the building and manufacturing processes. The Powerhouse also generates six megawatts of renewable electricity from landfill gas, a renewable fuel that would normally be flared, which we instead use to generate renewable electricity as part of our RE-100 target. The remainder of the plant\u2019s electric loads are served by wind and solar and are 100% powered by renewable energy. The project will eliminate steam, an inefficient heating method, by using the waste heat from the landfill gas engines to supply most of the building heat and converting other steam loads to direct or indirect natural gas. Additional energy conservation measures include the installation of ultraviolet lamps in air handling units, lighting and dock heater controls.\nAccelerating an All-Renewable Future\n\nIn 2021, we accelerated our timeline for sourcing 100% of our electricity from renewable sources for our U.S. sites to 2025, five years earlier than previously announced and 25 years ahead of our initial target set in 2016. In doing so, we also will help drive growth in the renewable energy sector.\n\nJust as GM has the scale to promote widespread adoption of EVs, we also have the scale to help bring about a transition to renewable power sources across the United States. We are the 12th largest offtaker in the world, and largest in the automotive industry, of renewable power purchase agreements by capacity. Reducing our own operational carbon footprint and setting up the grid for a future in which EVs can charge using renewable power for electricity is an essential part of our zero-emissions vision.\n\nBy accelerating our renewable energy for electricity goal, GM aims to avoid 1 million metric tons of carbon emissions that could have been produced between 2025 and 2030. The accelerated U.S. goal will position us to continue working toward our goal of sourcing 100% renewable energy to power global operations by 2035.\n\nThis U.S. goal builds upon approval of our targets. In 2021, the SBTi assessed GM\u2019s official submission against the Call to Action\u2019s eligibility criteria. The target submission for Scope 1 and 2 emissions is a reduction of absolute emissions of 72% by 2035 from a 2018 base year, which meets the minimum ambitions for a 1.5\u00b0C pathway. We are currently on track to meet the target by 2035 with 25% of our global electricity powered by renewable energy in 2021.\n\nQuantifying the Impact\n\n- 5 years we have accelerated our goal to source 100% renewable energy to supply electricity for our U.S. sites.\n- 1M metric tons of potential carbon emissions avoided if we meet our goal by 2025 instead of 2030.\n- The GHG emissions equivalent of 125,963 homes\u2019 energy use annually.\n\n1 BloombergNEF\nGM Renewable Energy for Electricity Initiatives\n\n- **MI\u2014Consumers Energy**\n  - Green Tariff\n  - 100 MW\n\n- **MI\u2014DTE**\n  - Green Tariff\n  - 447 MW\n\n- **IN\u2014On-Site Landfill Gas**\n  - Fort Wayne Assembly\u20146.4 MW\n\n- **MI\u2014On-Site Landfill Gas**\n  - Orion Assembly\u20148 MW\n\n- **Toledo, OH**\n  - On-Site Solar\n  - 1.8 MW\n\n- **Rochester, NY**\n  - On-Site Solar\n  - 0.345 MW\n\n- **Rancho Cucamonga, CA**\n  - Solar PPA (Rooftop)\n  - 3 MW\n\n- **Cactus Flats, TX**\n  - Wind PPA\n  - 100 MW\n\n- **Hilltopper, IL**\n  - Wind PPA\n  - 103 MW\n\n- **Bowling Green, KY**\n  - On-Site Solar\n  - 0.85 MW\n\n- **Newport, AR**\n  - Solar PPA\n  - 180 MW\n\n- **TN, KY\u2014TVA**\n  - Green Tariff\n  - 128 MW\n\n- **Hidalgo, TX**\n  - Wind PPA\n  - 30 MW\n\n- **Trishe, OH**\n  - Wind PPA\n  - 103 MW\n\n- **Rochester, NY**\n  - On-Site Solar\n  - 0.345 MW\n\n**Total Capacity of Renewable Electricity**\n\n- **14.4 MW**\n  - Landfill Gas\n\n- **313.995 MW**\n  - Solar\n\n- **830 MW**\n  - Wind\n\n---\n\n1 Figure includes both operating and executed agreements.\nOur Energy & Emissions Progress\n\nAbsolute Scope 1 & 2 Emissions\n(million metric tons CO2e)\n\n| Year | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | Goal |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|      | 5.7  | 5.3  | 3.8  | 3.4  | 1.6  |\n\nEnergy intensity is a global calculation. 2021 performance was higher than prior years due to lower vehicle production driven by semiconductor shortages and other COVID-related constraints.\n\nEnergy Intensity\n(MWh/Vehicle)\n(Energy used in GM\u2019s operations)\n\n| Year | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | Goal |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|      | 2.31 | 2.13 | 2.06 | 2.25 | 1.50 |\n\nRenewable Energy as a Percentage of Global Electricity Use\n\n| Year | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | Goal |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|      | 3%   | 22%  | 23%  | 25%  | 55%  |\n\n1 Based on estimated forecasted global renewable energy sourced through currently executed agreements, subject to change depending on actual future electric usage in operations, and actual future renewable generation.\n\nEnergy Consumption by Source\n\n- **1,713,704 GJ** Fuel Consumption From Renewable Sources (including heating)\n- **938,548 GJ** Steam Consumption\n- **21,048,701 GJ** Fuel Consumption From Nonrenewable Sources (including heating)\n- **21,489,324 GJ** Electricity Consumption (including cooling)\nClimate Innovation Goes the Extra Mile\n\nAs we move toward an all-electric future, it is on us to lead positive change and implement inclusive solutions.

These materials\u2014that represent more than 90% of the CO2 emissions generated by materials in our vehicles\u2014have been identified as part of our implementation strategy. The plan drives collaboration with our suppliers and applies data-driven strategies that can be customized to the specific attributes of each commodity.\n\nOur Materials Commodity Management Plan aims to procure increasingly sustainable materials via carbon emissions reductions through process innovation, recycled material content, renewable and fossil free energy for electricity and carbon capture utilization and storage.\n\nPlastics\nWe are collaborating with our plastics suppliers to advance circular economy practices and support the responsible utilization of resources. Some of their strategies to achieve those commitments include switching to renewable energy for electricity in their manufacturing processes, continued recycling efforts, incorporating biomaterials, improving processes in their own business and utilizing carbon capture technologies and carbon offsets. Our plastics suppliers are working to overcome common challenges in this industry, which include increasing costs, scaling issues and the quality of available feedstocks.\n\nNatural Rubber\nGM is a founding member of the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber, a multistakeholder initiative whose goal is to transition the natural rubber supply chain to a more sustainable model. The initiative now has more than 100 members, including Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs); tire manufacturers; rubber producers, processors and traders; nongovernmental organizations; and smallholder farmers. All members are expected to adopt a sustainability policy framework, which covers economic, social and environmental aspects of sustainability and will help protect ecological health, local livelihoods and fundamental human rights.\n\nSteel and Aluminum\nWe are engaging with our direct materials suppliers regarding how to make these materials more sustainable. We expect supplier carbon-emissions reductions to be achieved using process innovation, recycled materials, renewable energy for electricity and carbon capture utilization and storage. GM will work to secure supply of low-CO2 metals and materials ahead of their availability at scale. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we became the inaugural customer of a Nucor Corp. line of net-zero carbon steel products called Econiq.\n\nEV Battery Materials\nThe EV battery materials commodity management plan uses a combination of supply chain carbon reduction, the incorporation of recycled materials and third-party partnerships to help ensure responsible sourcing. While utilizing critical recycled minerals is a significant focus for GM, the advancement of the EV landscape will continue to depend on the use of raw materials until the EV circular economy reaches maturity. Read more about our work with the Responsible Minerals Initiative on page 93.\n\nTextiles\nTogether with our suppliers, we are developing dozens of new textile materials from items such as recycled plastic bottles. We are committed to developing 35% recycled content on seat insert fabrics and 100% recycled yarn for future seat bolster fabrics, overhead fabrics, floor carpets, floor mats and more in our upcoming vehicles. Beyond textiles, we are continually researching new and innovative materials, including bio-based alternatives, lower-impact leather tanning practices and alternatives to chrome plating.\n2021 Recycled Content in GM Vehicles\n\nGM is working to increase the sustainable materials used to make our vehicles. While these materials are not all available on all vehicles, each improvement provides valuable insights and brings us closer toward our goal.\n\n>17M pounds of recycled plastic was used in GM vehicles\n\n- Wheelhouse Liners: >11M pounds\n- HVAC Ducts: 2M pounds\n- Generator Covers: 7,000 pounds\n- Hood Seals: 6,000 pounds\n- Wiper Shields: 89,000 pounds\n- Center Console: 1.8M pounds\n- Underbody Shields: 644,341 pounds\n- Fans and Fan Shrouds: 165,375 pounds\n- Tow Hook Covers: 28,500 pounds\n- POSTCONSUMER NYLON Window Support Brackets: 1.3M pounds\n\n2023 Cadillac LYRIQ Debut Edition available Summer 2022, by reservation only.

Since the introduction of the GM Volt plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, we have developed a robust battery LCM program that spans from design, manufacturing and service to EoL and supports our sustainability goals. Ensuring proper LCM can help reduce energy and materials requirements throughout the battery supply chain and is key to minimizing sustainability impacts. We have created an ecosystem that ensures all batteries returned to GM are reused or recycled.\n\nIn parallel, GM\u2019s Global Purchasing and Supply Chain Team seeks to strengthen local supply of raw battery materials. As an example, we have announced work with Controlled Thermal Resources for the supply of locally sourced, low-cost lithium, and with POSCO chemicals to strengthen our own cathode active materials supply chain and localize its processing to North America.\n\nWhen it comes to vehicle EoL, we recognize the importance of enabling GM EV batteries to be disposed of properly. Today, GM\u2019s recyclemybattery.com website provides vehicle dismantlers with valuable information for disabling and removing battery packs from GM EVs. A list of EV battery recyclers is provided along with information on how to safely store and ship used EV battery packs. We will continue to develop guidelines that support safe handling, storage and transport of EV batteries by EoL processors and to evaluate opportunities to enable recycling of all EoL batteries.\n\nGM\u2019s EV battery life cycle management (LCM) is a crucial element in GM\u2019s commitment to an all-electric and a zero-emissions future.

A list of EV battery recyclers is provided along with information on how to safely store and ship used EV battery packs. We will continue to develop guidelines that support safe handling, storage and transport of EV batteries by EoL processors and to evaluate opportunities to enable recycling of all EoL batteries.\n\nBattery Recycling Initiatives\n\nWe will continue to evaluate opportunities for second-life use of batteries. However, battery recycling is our primary focus today and a key enabler to more sustainable battery supply chains. Recycling efforts in which GM is actively engaged include:\n\n- Collaboration with the Department of Energy\u2019s U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium and recyclers to advance lithium-ion battery recycling. These projects are validating recycled materials as alternatives to mined materials for battery manufacturing with the goal of reducing future needs for mining.\n\n- Strategic sourcing of recycled materials from multiple companies utilizes new hydrometallurgical processes that produce battery materials with approximately a 30% lower carbon footprint than when mined. These processes are used for all returned GM EV batteries as well as all battery material waste generated at GM and Ultium plants.\n\n- Continuous collaborations with suppliers in effective ways of using recycled battery materials in our own supply chain.\nUsing Sustainable Packaging\n\nWe have established a sustainable materials working group that is dedicated to sustainable packaging. The group is working closely with suppliers and external partners to innovate around current practices and embed circular economy principles in packaging procurement and design.\n\nAs part of this work, GM has partnered with WestRock as the preferred supplier for all consumer-facing packaging. WestRock prioritizes recycled content input in their sourcing, averaging 35% to 55% recycled content in corrugated boxes and 100% recycled content in coated boards. Our plan is for any virgin materials used in our packaging produced by WestRock to be certified by the Sustainable Forestry Initiative.\n\nIn 2021, approximately 8,000 parts for GM Customer Care & Aftersales were packaged in WestRock\u2019s sustainable consumer-facing packaging.\n\nSustainable Construction Practices\n\nGM\u2019s commitment to sustainability extends into global construction projects. In 2021, GM recycled over 140,000 tons of wood, metal, concrete and plastic produced in construction projects and found reuse initiatives for over 105,000 tons of concrete, soil, asphalt and other materials. We reduced our construction-driven CO2 impact by installing CarbonCure concrete at two GM projects in Spring Hill, Tennessee. Concrete using CarbonCure Technology\u2019s process has a lower carbon footprint than traditional concrete through their CO2 sequestering process.\n\nOne of the best examples of our sustainable construction practices is GM\u2019s Factory ZERO Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center, which has been retooled, upgraded and expanded to serve as a launchpad for GM\u2019s multi-brand all-EV strategy. During its conversion, we reused or recycled a wide range of materials that came out of the former factory, including crushed concrete from the floor that was repurposed for temporary roads around the facility.\n\nRead more about Factory ZERO in the Reducing Carbon Emissions section of this report.\nPursuing Zero Waste\n\nAs part of our \u201cZero Waste\u201d ambition, we aim to divert 90% of GM\u2019s operational waste generation from landfills and incineration, with or without energy recovery, by 2025.\n\nOur Zero Waste program was designed to be as comprehensive as possible, incorporating in its scope all solid waste, containerized liquids and hazardous waste. With this program we are helping to drive innovation in the recycling industry, supporting all elements of circular economy.\n\nA great example is our innovative project to reuse foundry sand. Our casting plant in Defiance, Ohio, ships their used sand to be reused in our Saginaw Metal Casting Operations (SMCO) in Michigan. The SMCO team tested multiple samples of the used sand from Defiance. In mid-2021, the first load of sand was delivered for a pilot test and the product met all the quality standards. A full reuse program was launched, enabling SMCO to avoid purchasing more than 1,120 tons of new sand. Other benefits include less mining of sand and lower dependency on natural resources, which increases resiliency in our supply chain.\n\nGM received 34 environmental sustainability awards recognizing various achievements, including implementing good manufacturing practices.\n\n86.4%\u00b9 2021 Zero Waste performance\n\n\u00b9GM Zero Waste represents the percentage of waste diverted from landfill, incinerators and energy recovery compared to a three-year average (2017\u20132019) baseline of total operational waste generated.\n\nWaste Reduction Across the Enterprise\n\nSustainability is considered everyone\u2019s responsibility at GM. Employees across our business units are highly engaged in our Zero Waste program. For example, at our global headquarters in Detroit, the GM Company Store is our branded merchandise hub for visitors, including auto enthusiasts. In 2021, the store created innovative ways to participate through packaging and environmentally sustainable merchandise, two areas that could have an immediate impact on the store\u2019s environmental footprint.\n\nThe store implemented environmentally friendly alternatives for all the materials used for packaging and shipping customer purchases. Recycled plastic bags replaced plastic bags; more biodegradable paper tapes replaced plastic tapes; and crinkled recycled craft paper replaced bubble wrap for wrapping fragile items such as coffee mugs. Finally, shipping boxes will contain only recycled cardboard going forward.\n\nIn sustainable merchandise, the store was proud to launch its first T-shirt featuring the new GM \u201ceverybody in\u201d logo on a T-shirt made from 100% recycled fabric.\n\nAs in the past, innovation, adoption of new technologies and engagement with suppliers both upstream and downstream help us adapt and be a steward in this area.\nExternal Engagement and Partnerships\n\nWaste minimization and landfill diversion require partnerships and collaborations throughout the industry. Current partnerships include:\n\n- The United States Automotive Materials Partnership LLC (USAMP) Chemical Recycling of Automotive Shredder Residue (ASR) Project has teamed with Eastman Chemical Company and PADNOS to demonstrate that plastics recovered from shredded EoL vehicles can be chemically recycled and used to make new automotive components. USAMP is a subsidiary of the United States Council for Automotive Research LLC, the collaborative technology company of Ford Motor Company, General Motors and Stellantis. The project will strive to minimize mechanical recycling and processing of ASR to prepare it for use as a feedstock for Eastman\u2019s Carbon Renewal Technology processes.\n\n- Through the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG) and Suppliers Partnership for the Environment, GM leads working groups with other automotive OEMs, including the Sustainable Materials and Packaging Teams. Together, we are defining key terminology and supporting the development of key performance indicators.\n\n- The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) America Recycles Day pledge, for which we collaborate with the EPA and other signatories to enhance the U.S. recycling system, helps to create a resilient path for circular economy to protect the environment.\n\nAiming Higher in South America\n\nOur Zero Waste target is more stringent in regions that have already met the 90% goal. For example, the target for GM South America (GMSA) is 95% diversion by 2025. As a leading region in the Zero Waste program, GMSA has achieved this high level of performance through engagement with several internal departments and local suppliers. The strategy involves an advanced environmental sustainability awareness program, reduction of waste, increase in waste sent for recycling, promotion of circular economy, containerization optimization and continuous improvement on manufacturing processes.\n\nCorporate Sustainability Employee Engagement\n\nIn September 2021, a new team was formed to support education and engagement globally. With the goal of empowering employees to champion sustainability in their unique position at GM, the team works with cross-functional subject matter experts and supports internal and external engagement opportunities. One key initiative established in 2021 to drive engagement at GM is the Sustainability Ambassador Program (SAP).\n\nThe SAP is a diverse group of employees spanning 10 countries and 200 unique GM organizations. Employees in this program have a proven passion and have dedicated time to support GM Sustainability aspirations and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). These employees are advocates for sustainability culture advancement throughout the organization, local sustainability strategists across teams and disrupters of institutional processes. These employees use the network to grow their skill set, support sustainability projects across the company and learn about new teams and initiatives. Ambassadors also include sustainability leads from each of the 11 employee resource groups.\n\nThe Sustainability Ambassadors meet monthly for fireside Q&As with leaders across the company to learn about advancements and challenges being overcome. To date, leaders from EV battery recycling, Global Purchasing and Supply Chain, Communications, Market Research and more have come to answer questions at this forum. In 2022, there will be more working groups forming through this platform to support sustainability projects across the enterprise.\n\nOur global facilities participated in over 200 focused local outreach events supporting environmental education to nearby schools, cleaning up local green spaces like nature preserves and watersheds, and planting native species in their communities.\nNature Conservancy Programs\n\nWe understand the value that natural ecosystems provide, not only to our operations, but also to our lives.\n\nTo truly embrace our everybody in culture, we develop solutions to preserve biodiversity and restore ecosystems at our facilities and in surrounding communities. These innovations have been implemented through engagements with multiple partners, such as the Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC), the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) and the Living Lands & Waters group.\n\nGM has published a Biodiversity by Design catalogue with the WHC that shares construction practices and ideas that support wildlife conservation. As an example, a parking lot at our GM Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, was converted into a green space and planted with native vegetation and pollinators to attract butterfly species.\n\nSince 2007, Living Lands & Waters has planted and distributed over 1.6 million trees throughout the Midwestern United States and beyond. GM has sponsored Living Lands & Waters for the past five years and supported its goal to plant more than 1 million trees, increase biodiversity, reduce erosion, improve water and air quality as well as mitigate the impacts of climate change.\n\nSince 2017, GM sites across the United States and Canada have received 63,058 trees and planted them on-site, in local green spaces and/or in locations chosen by employees and community partners.\n\nWHC certifies land areas that promote wildlife conservation to their set of standards. Through our WHC partnership, GM has achieved:\n\n- 31 certified programs, the largest within the automotive industry and fourth largest among leading WHC member companies.\n- 17 of those active sites are certified gold programs, the most gold programs of any organization in WHC.\n- Total of 124 biodiversity projects, focusing on educating and avian protection.\n\nGM has published a Biodiversity by Design catalogue with the WHC that shares construction practices and ideas that support wildlife conservation.

Students across the United States participate in wildlife habitat restoration, recycling programs, water preservation and many other sustainability programs. In 2021, more than 2,622 students participated in these projects. GM employees contributed more than 400 volunteer hours to help teachers and mentor students to complete their projects.\n\nIn 2021, GM celebrated the United Nations (U.N.) World Environment Day by engaging in 103 events globally, involving 33 schools and 2,160 community members. Pictured above is our Bupyeong complex at GM South Korea celebrating World Environment Day.\n\nDuring Earth Day, we launched 62 events globally, engaging with 791 members of the community. One of those events was planting a native species sample at GMSA\u2019s Joinville complex.\n\nThirty-one trees were planted on the George Washington Carver Elementary School campus for Arbor Day with assistance from Arizona Public Service and other community partners. All trees were intentionally picked for their drought resistance and ability to thrive in the desert ecosystem and provide future shade.\nReducing Water Intensity\n\nWater is a scarce resource that we must manage efficiently, especially in water-stressed areas.\n\nWhile GM\u2019s operations are not overly water-intensive, we do use water in the vehicle manufacturing process and make it available for the people in our facilities.\n\nWe are committed to responsibly using water while taking actions that preserve water quality and support conservation across our operations, in our supply chain and in the communities in which we operate. Our commitment to water stewardship has been recognized by GM being named to CDP\u2019s 2021 Water A List for the third time. GM engages with over 300 suppliers through CDP Water Security Supply Chain and other organizations like AIAG.\n\nGM is also a signatory to the CEO Water Mandate\u2014a U.N. Global Compact Initiative\u2014joining other global business leaders to address key challenges around water security and further aligning to the UN SDGs. We are mapping our water progress and achievements against the mandate\u2019s six core target areas: Direct Operations; Supply Chain and Watershed Management; Collective Action; Public Policy; Community Engagement; and Transparency.\n\nWe are working toward our goal to reduce the water intensity of our operations by 35% by 2035, compared to a 2010 baseline. This target builds on the water conservation work we have done in our GM facilities over the past decade. In 2021, our water intensity was 4.54 cubic meters per vehicle, which is higher than our projected path to meeting our 2035 goal. This was due to lower vehicle production at GM facilities driven by semiconductor shortages and other COVID-related constraints. There is a fixed amount of water that our operations need to run, regardless of the number of vehicles we produce so lower production impacts our water intensity measures. Our water conservation work continues to tackle that underlying water usage and drive down total water usage.\n\nGM Water Stewardship\n\nManaging water on a local basis whereby each facility sets its own targets for annual improvement according to the level of water stress in their local area.\n\nUsing the World Resources Institute\u2019s Aqueduct tools that map water risks\u2014floods, droughts and stress\u2014to annually identify risks in current operations with either alternate supply, conservation or water reuse.\n\nFocusing on areas within our operations with the greatest water impact, such as vehicle painting operations. SGMW Chongqing plant in China improved their utilization of reclaimed water by expanding use from irrigation and roof cooling to also using the water in their painting operations.\n\nEvaluating water usage at the vehicle component level to identify parts that have the highest life cycle water impacts such as structures, seats and drivelines, and working with suppliers to help unlock opportunities for improvement.\n\nEngaging employees at manufacturing facilities through water treasure hunts, focused activities where groups come together to seek out new ways to reduce consumption. The GM Tonawanda facility reduced cooling water by over 55,000 cubic meters in 2021 after participating in a water treasure hunt.\n\nGoal: Aiming to reduce the water intensity of our operations by 35% by 2035, compared to a 2010 baseline.\nAdvancing Transformative Technologies\n\nIN THIS SECTION\n\nOur Path to EV Leadership 41\nSuper Cruise and Ultra Cruise Driver Assistance Technology 42\nCommercializing Self-Driving Vehicles 43\nUrban Solutions for Last-Mile Delivery 45\n\nOur Strengths\n\n- Deploying all-electric, self-driving shared vehicles in fleets, through Cruise\n- Integrating multiple mobility breakthroughs\u2014such as autonomy, sharing and electrification\u2014into a single vehicle, accelerating the acceptance and adoption of each\n- Creating new urban mobility solutions, such as last-mile delivery and other transportation-related businesses\n- Advocating for regulations to address the advent of commercial self-driving technologies\n\nOur Opportunities\n\n- Building trust and understanding among customers for automated driving systems\n- Developing commercially viable business models for shared mobility solutions\nOur Path to EV Leadership\n\nTransformation and innovation have been part of GM\u2019s DNA for more than 100 years.\n\nToday, as we pursue our vision of zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, GM is once again delivering technologies that redefine how people and goods are moved.\n\nOur business growth model is predicated on leveraging leading positions in electrification, hydrogen fuel cell, autonomy and connected vehicles\u2014positions that are enabling GM\u2019s path to EV leadership.\n\nAs an example, our new software platform, Ultifi, is made possible by the investments made in GM\u2019s vehicle intelligence platform and position us to scale new software, and services rapidly and securely across our entire fleet. Through software, we expect to unlock new opportunities and experiences for our customers, similar to the way smartphone applications use cameras and sensors to deliver a new communications experience. A vehicle like the Cadillac LYRIQ has up to 15 cameras and more than 100 sensors on board. With Ultifi, we can develop new features and functions that redefine the vehicle experience. This platform is expected to be a key part of our strategy to keep improving our gas-powered portfolio while also helping to create experiences that attract customers to our growing portfolio of electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nCurrently our Global Innovation Team is conducting a pilot project for a software-enabled platform, currently internally called Future Roads, which provides risk scoring, crash hot spots and seatbelt usage insights leveraging anonymized vehicle data. With these actionable insights, governments can take more effective and cost-efficient steps to create safer and better maintained communities. Over the next few years, we plan to release additional products such as road weather reporting, pothole locations, road roughness and more.\n\nEverything In\n\nOur advanced propulsion technology platforms present the potential to electrify everything\u2014going well beyond today\u2019s on-road vehicle application. The unique modularity and flexibility of the Ultium platform opens opportunities beyond our own vehicles. Ultium, together with our HYDROTEC fuel cell platform, gives GM the potential to transform a variety of transportation modes into zero-emission products.\n\nIn 2021, GM made the following moves to extend all-electric solutions beyond automotive vehicles:\n\n- In early 2022, GM announced plans for multiple HYDROTEC fuel cell-based power generators that provide mobile DC fast charging capability for EVs without imposing on the grid. These HYDROTEC fuel cell generators could ultimately replace gas- and diesel-burning generators with zero-emissions technology in a variety of places, as well as provide backup power during power disruptions.\n\n- GM has taken a strategic stake in Pure Watercraft, which specializes in creating all-electric boating solutions. The collaboration is expected to leverage Pure Watercraft\u2019s innovative marine propulsion technology and experience in the commercial marine industry with GM\u2019s battery technology, engineering, supply chain and manufacturing capabilities.\n\n- GM and Liebherr Aerospace signed a joint development agreement to co-develop hydrogen fuel cell-powered aeronautics technology. The companies are expected to work toward the creation of an electrical power generation system that demonstrates how hydrogen fuel cell-based power systems could be used in aircrafts.\n\n- We have an agreement to supply HYDROTEC fuel cell power cubes to Navistar for use in its production model fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV)\u2014the International\u00ae RH\u2122 Series. The FCEV is expected to receive energy from two GM HYDROTEC fuel cell power cubes.\n\n- GM and Lockheed Martin entered an agreement to develop a Lunar Mobility Vehicle to enable astronauts to explore the lunar surface farther than ever before as part of NASA\u2019s Artemis program to send humans back to the moon.\n\n- GM and Wabtec Corporation have entered into a nonbinding memorandum of understanding to leverage our Ultium battery and HYDROTEC fuel cell technologies for Wabtec locomotives.\nSuper Cruise and Ultra Cruise Driver Assistance Technology\n\nGM\u2019s strong leadership position in vehicle electrification and connectivity platforms is matched by a similarly strong position in advanced driver assistance technologies, some of which enable hands-free driving under compatible driving conditions.\n\n22 vehicles offered with Super Cruise globally by the end of 2023\n\n10M+ miles have been driven using Super Cruise to date\n\nThe technologies to support these systems provide the building blocks to leverage across other important applications, including the development of advanced vehicle safety features and fully autonomous technologies.\n\nOur move toward such systems began with Super Cruise, the world\u2019s first truly hands-free driver assistance technology, which was introduced in 2017 with the 2018 Cadillac CT6 and provided drivers with more than 140,000 miles of compatible roads in the United States and Canada. In 2019, the road network was expanded to 200,000 miles.\n\nSuper Cruise will be available on 22 vehicles globally by the end of 2023, including the 2022 Chevrolet Bolt EUV, the GMC HUMMER EV, Cadillac Escalade and many other models.\n\nIn 2021, we unveiled Ultra Cruise, which will take advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) technology to the next level. Ultra Cruise is designed to enable door-to-door, hands-free driving in 95% of driving situations, including city streets, subdivision streets and paved rural roads, in addition to highways. Eventually, the technology is expected to expand to every paved road in the United States and Canada. We expect that Ultra Cruise will be one of the premier and most capable ADAS features in the market.\n\nBoth Super Cruise and Ultra Cruise are expected to leverage the Ultifi software platform and Vehicle Intelligence Platform to enable continuous improvement as each system evolves over time, with more frequent updates adding features, services and functions over-the-air.\n\nWhile Ultra Cruise is expected to be available on select vehicles, Super Cruise is planned to be offered more broadly across GM\u2019s portfolio, expanding access to more customers.\n\n1 Always pay attention while driving and when using Super Cruise. Do not use a hand-held device. Requires active Super Cruise plan or trial. Terms apply. Automatic Lane Change and Lane Change on Demand are not available while trailering.\nCommercializing Self-Driving Vehicles\n\nGM\u2019s path to autonomous vehicles (AVs) is key to achieving our aspiration of enabling a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion.\n\nGM and Cruise are pursuing what we believe to be the most comprehensive path to autonomous mobility in the industry. Since GM\u2019s 2016 acquisition of Cruise, GM\u2019s majority-owned autonomous startup, Cruise has been developing its core AV technology with safety as its gating metric, while refining its operations to enable its autonomous ride-hail and goods delivery business. In October 2020, Cruise became one of the first California companies permitted by the California Department of Motor Vehicles to test AVs without a trained test driver in the vehicle, and the first company to do so in the complex driving environment of San Francisco.\n\nIn June 2021, Cruise became the first company to receive a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to provide passenger test rides in its AVs without a trained test driver in the vehicle. As the first company to receive such a permit, Cruise has been conducting fully driverless rides with the public\u2014completing hundreds of such test rides by the end of 2021.\n\nPending final approval from the CPUC, Cruise is one permit away from being able to commercialize its fully autonomous ride-hail business within its operational design domain in San Francisco. Cruise remains on track to begin charging for fully driverless ride-hail operations in the coming months.\n\nCruise is also continuing to expand its collaboration with Walmart, which invested in Cruise in 2021. Last year, Cruise and Walmart launched a fully autonomous commercial delivery service in Scottsdale, Arizona, with more than 3,000 deliveries completed by the end of 2021. Walmart customers in the area are now able to opt-in to autonomous delivery services and track their order through the Cruise web app.\n\nGM and Cruise continue to gain technological expertise and experience, leveraging software and technology innovation combined with GM\u2019s innovation and vast automotive design, engineering, manufacturing, testing, validation and proven quality methods. Together, GM and Cruise\u2019s work is expected to advance both company\u2019s integrated AV strategy while providing maximum flexibility to pursue the most value-accretive path to commercializing and unlocking the full potential of AV technology. Cruise has attracted funding from various third-party investors, including Microsoft and Walmart. GM recently acquired SoftBank\u2019s $2.1 billion stake in Cruise, and, separately, invested an additional $1.3 billion, leveraging the strength of our balance sheet to capitalize on the opportunity to increase our equity investment in Cruise and advance our integrated autonomous vehicle strategy.\n\nInvestment in China\n\nChina, the world\u2019s largest automotive market, is embracing electrification and autonomous technology faster than anywhere else in the world. In 2021, GM announced a $300 million investment in Momenta to accelerate the development of next-generation self-driving technologies for future GM vehicles in China.\n\nGM is collaborating with companies around the world, such as Momenta, to build its technology capabilities and support diverse consumer choices across the globe. Launch timing for the next-generation ADAS technologies that will be deployed in China and other details will be shared closer to production.\n\n1 Available on select Apple devices. Service availability, features and functionality vary by vehicle, device and the plan you are enrolled in. User terms apply.\nGM and Cruise continue to make progress on the Cruise Origin, a purpose-built, all-electric, fully autonomous vehicle\u2014the result of collaborative efforts among GM, Honda and Cruise. The Cruise Origin represents several aspirations for the future of safe mobility: a vehicle that is shared, autonomous and electric.\n\nThe Cruise Origin is designed to operate without a steering wheel, pedals or a driver. The vehicle will have more space for passengers and goods. GM and Cruise are working together to create economies of scale that lower costs and increase quality. In the process, this will help enable us to offer a more inclusive mobility option for people such as senior citizens, those with disabilities or those who do not currently have access to reliable transportation.\n\nWe believe shared mobility offers significant potential to reduce urban congestion. The global population, particularly in cities, is growing rapidly. By 2030, the world is projected to have 41 megacities with 10 million inhabitants or more.\n\nCurrently, ride-hailing represents only a small fraction of vehicle miles driven in the United States, and most privately owned vehicles spend most of their time unused. By encouraging passengers to ride together in shared cars and shuttles, ride-hailing can further increase efficiency and reduce congestion.\n\nAnother potential benefit of the Cruise Origin is more affordable transportation. A fully autonomous vehicle eliminates certain expenses associated with traditional, conventional ride-hailing with a human driver. With a lower cost structure, an autonomous ride-hail and delivery service can charge less and be available for more communities.\n\nGM currently is manufacturing pre-production of Cruise Origin at GM\u2019s Global Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, and is on track to begin production by the first quarter of 2023 at GM\u2019s Factory ZERO in Detroit, Michigan.\nUrban Solutions for Last-Mile Delivery\n\nThe World Economic Forum estimates that demand for urban last-mile delivery, fueled by e-commerce, will grow by 78% by 2030, leading to a 36% increase in delivery vehicles in the world\u2019s top 100 cities\u2014further exacerbating urban congestion and pollution.\n\nThis increase in demand is expected to cause delivery-related carbon emissions to rise by 21% and add 11 minutes to each passenger\u2019s commute.\n\nThird-party logistics companies, which manage fleets of many thousands of vehicles, are on the front lines of these challenges, rising to meet demand while addressing the associated increases in emissions and congestion. In addition, these companies are faced with labor shortages and occupational injuries due to the physical strain of handling packages. Curb management is also a safety consideration. On congested urban streets, a parked delivery vehicle can create traffic hazards, while the manual unloading of packages can clog sidewalks and bike lanes, and present bicyclist and pedestrian safety concerns.\n\nOur solution to these challenges is BrightDrop, an internal startup devoted to decarbonizing last-mile deliveries through an ecosystem of electric products, software and services that empower companies to move goods more efficiently. BrightDrop is designed to help businesses lower their ownership and operating costs, maximize labor productivity and improve employee safety and freight security\u2014all while operating with products that work together intelligently and with zero operating emissions.\n\nBrightDrop launched publicly in 2021 and introduced its first products, the Zevo 600, an electric light commercial vehicle (eLCV) built for the delivery of goods and services over long ranges1, and the Trace. The Trace is a smart, electrically propelled cart that helps reduce time and physical effort required for couriers to get goods from the delivery van to customers. A customer field test demonstrated 25% improvement in package delivery volumes per route, enabling the reduction of total vehicles in use. The Trace can also enable multimodal delivery models where vehicles drop off the Traces and foot or bike couriers can then complete the final delivery, further reducing congestion and operational costs. The Trace can be used as a standalone product or can be coupled with the Zevo 600.\n\n1 GM estimate of up to 250 miles on a full charge, subject to change. GM estimated range based on current capability of analytical projection consistent with Society of Automotive Engineers J1634 revision 2017\u2013MCT. Actual range may vary based on several factors, including temperature, terrain, battery age, loading, and how the vehicle is used and maintained.\nBrightDrop completed the first production builds of the Zevo 600 in September 2021, making the Zevo 600 the fastest vehicle program to market in GM\u2019s history. The record-setting development timeline of just 20 months was made possible by leveraging the highly flexible Ultium battery platform, innovative virtual development processes established by the GMC HUMMER EV program and an agile approach to manufacturing development. The timetable enabled delivery of the first few of 500 eLCVs to FedEx Express, BrightDrop\u2019s first customer, in December.\n\nAlso in 2021, BrightDrop unveiled the Zevo 400, a smaller eLCV. Verizon, one of the largest fleet operators in the United States, is the first customer slated to integrate the Zevo 400 into its field maintenance and service fleet. The Zevo 400 combines many of the same features of the Zevo 600, but its smaller size enables enhanced curb management, maneuverability and the ability to fit into a standard-size parking space\u2014a benefit for customer operations and a key feature to help reduce street congestion in urban areas.\n\nIn early 2022, BrightDrop also added Walmart as a customer, with the retailer reserving 5,000 units of BrightDrop\u2019s Zevo 600 and smaller Zevo 400 electric delivery vans to be ordered. The units will support Walmart\u2019s last-mile delivery network and goal of operating an all-electric logistics fleet by 2040.\n\nBrightDrop is an example of how we are leveraging technology platforms into new markets while also leveraging GM\u2019s ability to execute at scale. We are converting our CAMI manufacturing plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, to produce the BrightDrop eLCVs.\nEarning Customers for Life\n\nOur Strengths\n\n- Building upon strong performance where customers are willing to recommend our brands based on their experiences\n- Continuing to leverage digital solutions to simplify interactions, increase value and deliver world-class experiences\n- Continuing to strengthen our commitment to building quality vehicles\n\nOur Opportunities\n\n- Helping dealers and employees to adjust to automotive trends, such as the transition to selling electric vehicles (EVs), in order to meet customer expectations\n- Ensuring the same high-level quality vehicles as we deploy increasing levels of advanced technology\n- Maintaining consistent experiences across thousands of customer interactions worldwide\nIn 2021, the CX Team, working cross-functionally with our internal and external partners, have designed, developed and launched more than 2,000 customer-impacting improvements touching digital customer interfaces, contact centers, brand sites and GM\u2019s loyalty program. A few of those improvements include new dynamic content in the mobile app, an all new e-commerce platform allowing customers to purchase replacement parts online and a customer self-service hub built into the brand websites.\n\nWe also make great efforts to ensure our customers can share their feedback with us through the GM Customer Assistance Center. Our Customer Assistance Center is integrated with our U.S. dealer network, field organization, technical and parts assistance, engineering, product quality teams and OnStar and Roadside teams. GM customers can easily report a suggestion, concern or comment through the web channel, email address or phone hotline. This highly dedicated global team supports over 2.5 million interactions monthly to quickly account for feedback and help resolve concerns.\n\nIn addition to listening to customers through the Customer Assistance Center, GM has launched a new customer feedback management tool that aggregates millions of comments from customers across all channels. The intelligence of this tool allows us to listen to customers, identify opportunities and proactively reach out to support customers as well as continually feed the insights internally to improve our products, services and experiences.\n\nCustomer Experience\n\nOur Customer Experience (CX) Team\u2019s purpose is to create safe and effortless experiences that customers actually love.\n\nWe aim to deliver experiences that feel simple, convenient, human, satisfying, and beautiful.\n\nQuotes are sourced from Clarabridge customer feedback management tool and are intentionally anonymized.\n\nLove this BUICK app easy to use and has all my car\u2019s information. 11/02/2021\n\nFleet Opps Advisers always do a great job of helping me do my job! 03/23/2022\n\nRewarding Loyalty\n\nMy GM Rewards program, the most comprehensive automotive loyalty program, allows enrolled members to earn and redeem points on eligible purchases, including new GM vehicles, parts, accessories, paid dealer services and OnStar and Connected Services plans.

User terms apply.\n\n2 2018\u20132021 year-end.\nOur focus on the customer defines how we develop, engineer and manufacture our vehicles with quality and durability goals in mind, starting with the vehicle development process.\n\nWe harness customer feedback from global markets to help shape our customers\u2019 product experience, using our GM Compass customer survey to gather preferences on a variety of issues\u2014from performance and efficiency to how people interact with their vehicles.\n\nThe Global Vehicle Development Process is rooted in a cultural commitment to design, engineer and build quality vehicles. Building upon GM\u2019s \u201cWho We Are\u201d and \u201cHow We Behave\u201d foundational statements, employees are committed to a goal of delivering quality as a value supported by key initiatives and behaviors. This commitment involves three elements:\n\n- **Product Safety**, which includes our Speak Up For Safety program, Safety Field Investigation processes, Prevent Repeat Defects process and Safety Incident Protocols. The Speak Up For Safety program and Safety Field Investigation processes help identify and investigate potential issues. Prevent Repeat Defects is one of the approaches we use to help confirm field learnings are captured in our standard work to prevent the issue from reoccurring.\n\n- **Systems Engineering**, which uses a systems approach to translate our customers\u2019 needs into industry-leading vehicle designs. IT-based systems help map, flow and trace requirements across engineering organizations to help ensure our products are safe, reliable and win in the marketplace.\n\n- **Quality Chain** is an integrated approach to connecting quality tools and methods that enables cross-functional team collaboration to mitigate defects from reaching our customers. This is executed by connecting vehicle-level requirements to system, subsystem and component levels. This helps drive enterprise-wide engagement so design and process issues can be mitigated across all systems and processes.\n\nWe also emphasize systems engineering companywide. This includes requiring all people to practice the discipline of systems thinking, understanding how their individual roles contribute to the bigger picture, rather than thinking in silos. GM also has quality tools that work as interconnected processes and cross system and organizational boundaries. Using these tools together helps us build discipline into our process for identifying and addressing failure modes.\n\nThese product development centric elements are foundational and complemented by our Launch Excellence initiative. The initiative uses affinity diagrams to help teams focus on what must be true in terms of process and discipline to successfully navigate vehicle development.\nQuality Assurance\n\nOur quality policies and philosophy of continuous improvement help us shape our customers\u2019 product experience.\n\nAll GM suppliers are required to be ISO 9000 certified\u2014a set of international standards on quality management and quality assurance. Likewise, all manufacturing operations that require International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001:2015 certification by certain regions/countries have done so. Globally, we have transitioned to the new ISO 9001:2015 standard, which is aligned with the most recent trends. Fifty-two operations have completed the transition and certification through 2021. We have nine component plants certified to the International Automotive Task Force (IATF) 16949 standards. We also maintain a Global Manufacturing System that incorporates all ISO and IATF requirements, guides quality aspects of our business and has more rigorous standards, in some cases, than external ones.\n\nA focus of our quality assurance programs is \u201cinitial quality,\u201d which refers to vehicle issues that customers may experience in the first months of ownership. In recent years, customer convenience features, such as user-friendly infotainment systems, seat comfort or placement of knobs and handles, have emerged as top initial quality issues rather than component-related issues. We measure our performance in this area through a key metric: J.D. Power Initial Quality Study (IQS) Problems Per Hundred.\n\nVehicle Quality and Satisfaction Recognitions\n\nJ.D.

It is foundational that dealerships deliver a consistent level of sales and aftersales excellence to earn and maintain customer trust.\n\nU.S. Dealer Quality Programs\n\nThere are two elements of quality management systems that help us achieve this consistency across dealers: facility/customer experience conformance and sales performance. These elements are measured over five Dealer Quality programs:\n\n- **The Standards for Excellence (SFE) program**\n  - Measures dealers' and sales consultants' sales performance. Out of GM's 3,855 Chevrolet, Buick and GMC dealerships, 3,343 dealers and more than 26,378 sales consultants were enrolled in the 2021 SFE program.\n\n- **The Essential Brand Elements (EBE) program**\n  - Measures a dealer's conformance to a defined facility image as well as conformance to specific customer-related brand standards. Out of GM's 3,855 Chevrolet, Buick and GMC dealerships, 3,044 dealers were enrolled in the 2021 EBE program.\n\n- **The EV Experience (EVX)**\n  - Provides CX standards to assist dealers in offering EV customers an educational and transparent experience in their shopping and purchase of an EV. Includes specific training, equipment, tools and advertising guidelines. The EVX program also includes a sales performance opportunity for the EV specialist at the dealership. Out of GM's 3,834 dealers that have either a Chevy and/or GMC franchise, 2,867 are enrolled.\n\n- **The Parts and Service Excellence (PASE) incentive**\n  - Designed to pull together many key aftersales metrics under one program to win customers for life. Out of GM's 4,048 dealerships, there are 3,780 enrolled in the PASE program.\n\n- **Project Pinnacle**\n  - The goal of Project Pinnacle is to drive dealer engagement in providing a customer experience in line with the luxury competitive set. Out of GM's 564 Cadillac dealerships, there are 523 enrolled in the Cadillac Pinnacle program.\n\nWe also maintain the Mark of Excellence program, which annually recognizes high-achieving dealers, as well as specific employees and teams at dealers. Out of GM's 4,048 Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac dealerships across the United States, 3,165 dealers and 68,403 dealer employees were enrolled in the 2021 Mark of Excellence program.\n\nWe provide both technical and nontechnical training to help our dealers meet or exceed their customers\u2019 expectations. This training includes modules for sales, finance, front office and management staff; apps for sales and service; both online and hands-on training for technicians; and interactive job aids or reference documents to help reinforce what they\u2019ve learned. Departments within the dealership relating to sales must maintain a certain level of training performance each quarter.\n\nTraining requirements for service technicians include third-party Automotive Service Excellence certification, an industry-standard and customer-recognized seal of quality. In addition, technicians who have achieved GM World Class Technician status have completed over 435 hours of training.\nKeeping People Safe\n\nIN THIS SECTION\n\nVehicle Safety 53\nDeveloping Safe Products 54\nCulture of Safety 59\n\nOur Strengths\n\n- Putting forth our safety brand, Periscope, which integrates advocacy, research and technology to help illustrate the importance we place on vehicle safety\n- Broadening our internal view of safety to include other aspects of well-being, including physical health, mental health and inclusion\n- Applying workplace best practices and educating GM leaders and team members on the power they have to affect safety outcomes by modeling safe behaviors and business practices\n- Continued engagement from a global workforce on the topics of vehicle and personal safety\n\nOur Opportunities\n\n- Addressing driving behaviors that are often beyond our control, such as driver distraction and impairment\n- Educating consumers on the benefits and features of the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) on their vehicles to encourage greater adoption\nVehicle Safety\n\nOur safety brand, Periscope, helps customers see how GM looks at safety, holistically. Periscope is how we engineer for safety through a human lens\u2014focusing on driver behaviors and the driving environment, and developing features and technologies that can assist the driver and help keep customers safe.\n\nPeriscope brings together safety research, advocacy and technology to focus on the safety of drivers, passengers and those outside the vehicle. Part of our safety research is work with world-renowned universities and institutes, including the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) and the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI). Our safety advocacy supports nonprofit organizations, including Safe Kids Worldwide. And, our development of in-vehicle technologies can help drivers avoid crashes, reduce injuries and save lives.\n\nA Holistic Approach to Vehicle Safety\n\nPeriscope embodies safety from three perspectives:\n\n- **Zero Crashes**: Engineering advanced technologies and features.\n- **The Vehicle**: Education and advocacy to help reduce driver error and risky driving behaviors.\n- **The Driver**: Leveraging renowned research partnerships to help influence vehicle and driving policies to make city and community infrastructures safer.\n- **The Environment**: GM has a rich history of safety innovation\u2014from the first production airbag systems in the 1970s to today\u2019s Super Cruise feature, which uses a series of escalating alerts (including a steering wheel light bar) to prompt the driver to pay close attention to the road ahead (monitored by a Driver Attention System face camera) and take steering control whenever take-over requests are issued.\n\nChevrolet safety engineer helping her teenage daughter learn to drive using Chevrolet teen driver technology.\nDeveloping Safe Products\n\nAs we continue to transform mobility through new technology platforms, we are committed to incorporating safety every step of the way. The safety of our employees and customers is of the utmost importance.\n\nDecision-making for safety issues includes executives at the highest levels of the company and engages employees at every level to identify potential vehicle safety issues. The vice president of global product safety and systems leads the product safety organization and is accountable for developing GM\u2019s vehicle safety systems, confirming and validating our vehicle safety performance, identifying emerging issues and conducting field actions, including recalls.\n\nGlobal Product Safety Management Process\n\nRobust teams of internal product investigators and safety forensic engineers help identify and investigate potential vehicle safety issues. A data analytics team merges multiple inputs\u2014such as Speak Up For Safety submissions and dealer service records\u2014to build a unique, comprehensive database. Through statistical analysis and machine learning models, potential issues are identified early by linking key information from disparate data sources.\n\nAppropriate levels of management, up to senior leadership, review issues. When a decision is made for a recall, a cross-functional team initiates all necessary actions to inform appropriate government agencies, dealers and customers.\n\nThe team supplies a remedy to the customer free of charge and provides follow-up communication to customers to encourage them to get the repair. Completion rates are monitored and shared where appropriate with government agencies. Meanwhile, Global Product Safety and Systems improves cross-system integration and addresses functional safety and compliance in the vehicle development process.\n\nLearn more about our product development process in Earning Customers for Life.\nEngineering Advanced Technologies and Features\n\nIn our pursuit of a world with zero crashes, we will continue to provide foundational vehicle safety through crash performance, thoughtful reminders, technology to help avoid or mitigate crashes and other safety innovations.\n\nEven with the latest advancements in vehicle safety technology, seat belts remain the primary occupant restraint in the vehicle and can help save lives when properly worn. In 2020, NHTSA estimated that front seat belt use is about 90% in the United States, yet almost half of in-vehicle fatalities are unbelted occupants. For this reason, increasing seat belt use remains a priority at GM, and we are expanding our Buckle to Drive feature to more models. When turned on, this feature can prevent the vehicle from being shifted into gear for up to 20 seconds while reminding unbelted drivers to buckle their seat belt through a chime and a visual message.\n\n1 Always use seat belts and child restraints. Children are safer when properly secured in a rear seat in the appropriate child restraint. See the Owner\u2019s Manual for more information.\n\n2 Visit https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/seat-belts for more details.\nHelping drivers avoid crashes is another GM priority. ADAS innovations are already available today that represent significant steps toward avoiding crashes. For example, under certain conditions, Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) can help avoid or reduce the harm caused by striking the rear end of a detected vehicle ahead. AEB automatically provides hard emergency braking or enhances the driver\u2019s hard braking if the system detects such a collision is imminent under certain conditions. Similarly, Lane Keep Assist with Lane Departure Warning provides gentle steering wheel turns to help keep the driver from inadvertently leaving their lane. Through building-block changes such as these, drivers are increasingly aided in helping to avoid or mitigate the harm caused by common crashes.\n\nGlobal Deployment of ADAS\n\nNumber of models with these technologies available or as standard equipment out of 71 total models\n\n| Technology                                      | Models Available |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Forward Collision Alert                        | 50               |\n| Safety Alert Seat                               | 26               |\n| Lane Keep Assist With Lane Departure Warning   | 43               |\n| HD Surround Vision                              | 29               |\n| Lane Departure Warning                         | 10               |\n| Rear Cross Traffic Alert                       | 41               |\n| Adaptive Cruise Control                        | 33               |\n| Front Pedestrian Braking                       | 45               |\n| Enhanced Automatic Emergency Braking or Automatic Emergency Braking | 47               |\n\nSafety or driver assistance features are no substitute for the driver\u2019s responsibility to operate the vehicle in a safe manner. The driver must remain attentive to traffic, surroundings and road conditions at all times. Visibility, weather and road conditions may affect feature performance. Read the vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual for more important feature limitations and information.\n\nEducation and Advocacy\n\nGM recognizes the need to continue building public awareness of roadway safety risks by promoting safe driving behaviors and a safe roadway environment. We invest in nonprofit relationships and initiatives to promote good behaviors such as seat belt usage and educate on the dangers of impaired and distracted driving. Examples of current relationships and initiatives include:\n\nFor more than 20 years, GM and Safe Kids Worldwide have collaborated to help keep kids safe in and around vehicles through many programs, like the GM-funded Buckle Up Program. The Buckle Up Program works through a nationwide coalition to provide inspection stations and free car seat check-up events throughout the year. In fact, over 30 of our own GM employees are trained as certified Child Passenger Safety Technicians and also volunteer their time to support these car seat check-up public events.\n\nDirected toward the teen driver, GM partners with National Organizations for Youth Safety to implement the annual Seat Belts Save (SBS) Challenge. SBS is a four-week campaign designed to educate teens about the dangers of riding in a vehicle without wearing a seat belt and to increase the number of teens who regularly wear a seat belt while driving or riding in a vehicle.\n\nAmerica Walks is leading the way in advancing safe, equitable, accessible and enjoyable places to walk and move by giving people and communities the resources to effectively advocate for change. GM supports America Walks to ensure pedestrians are equipped with resources to remain safe when sharing roadways with motorists, bicyclists and others.\n\nIn 2021, GM provided grant funding in support of Project Look Out, a U.S.-based media campaign aimed at preventing distracted driving. GM support aided Project Look Out in moving from its development phase to its implementation phase.

GM works with world-class research institutes to study how safety technologies currently available in vehicles are making a real-world difference on the path to a world with zero crashes. We have collaborated with organizations such as NHTSA, UMTRI, Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the Highway Loss Data Institute.\n\nFollowing a landmark police report study conducted in 2019, GM continued to work with UMTRI to analyze the field effectiveness of a wide range of GM ADAS and headlighting technology in addressing rear-end striking, pedestrian, lane departure, lane change and backing crashes. In the latest study, UMTRI performed an analysis using over 10.9 million GM Model Year 2013\u20132020 vehicles along with police reports from 14 states. After comparing the crash instances involving vehicles with and without ADAS features, the study provided further evidence that much of this technology is making a proven impact, with statistically significant results, to help reduce crashes or mitigate injuries when crashes do occur. (Please see UMTRI-2022-2 report for further details.)\n\nBecause a key purpose of ADAS features is to alert the driver to potential crashes, how the driver is alerted and how the driver responds also play an important role to help ensure feature effectiveness in the field. GM has conducted significant research to determine how best to communicate those alerts to the driver so that they can take action to help avoid a crash threat. For example, the GM-exclusive Safety Alert Seat was developed with research conducted by TNO in the Netherlands, as well as with the VTTI. The Safety Alert Seat provides directional seat vibrations to help alert drivers of the direction of potential crash threats detected by various active safety systems. This haptic alert supplements provided visual alerts and has been shown to be preferred by our customers and to increase usage of ADAS that employ the technology.\n\nTo learn more about UMTRI please visit https://www.umtri.umich.edu\n\nEffectiveness of ADAS\n\n- **Front Pedestrian Braking** reduced frontal pedestrian crashes by 23%\n- **IntelliBeam**, or auto high beam highlighting, reduced a combined set of frontal animal, pedestrian and bicyclist crashes by 22%\n- **Lane Keep Assist with Lane Departure Warning** reduced roadway departure crashes by 17%, and reduced such crashes with reported suspected minor injury or higher injury severities for anyone in the crash by 21%\n- **AEB** (or Forward Automatic Braking) with Forward Collision Alert reduced rear end striking crashes by 41%, and reduced such crashes with reported suspected minor injury or higher severities for anyone in the crash by 55%\n- **Lane Change Alert with Side Blind Zone Alert** reduced lane change crashes by 16%\n- **The Reverse Automatic Braking feature, combined with Rear Vision Camera, Rear Park Assist and Rear Cross Traffic Alert** reduced backing crashes by 83%\n\n---\n\n1 Safety or driver assistance features are no substitute for the driver\u2019s responsibility to operate the vehicle in a safe manner. The driver must remain attentive to traffic, surroundings and road conditions at all times. Visibility, weather and road conditions may affect feature performance. Read the vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual for more important feature limitations and information.\nOnStar Safety Innovation\n\nPeriscope\u2019s holistic view of safety extends to OnStar, our safety and security service. For years, OnStar has helped customers primarily by responding to crashes or vehicle issues. Today, the service is expanding beyond both the vehicle and GM customers through the OnStar Guardian mobile phone app. The app enables customers to access certain OnStar support services whether at home, out walking or in any vehicle, regardless of brand or ownership. In 2021, we expanded the availability of the app to GM customers in Mexico and made it available to anyone in the United States and Canada with a compatible Apple or Android device.\n\nAlso in 2021, OnStar and RapidDeploy, a public safety technology company working to accelerate Next Generation 911, launched a first-of-its-kind program to supply every 911 call center in California with OnStar\u2019s Automatic Crash Response notifications. The certified emergency OnStar advisor will coordinate with the appropriate 911 center for rescue and response. In addition, GM invested in RapidDeploy, which will enable the company to improve the public safety community\u2019s situational awareness with a cloud-native, data-driven solution. This investment underscores GM and OnStar\u2019s commitment to working with the public safety community to support and accelerate Next Generation 911.\n\nIncorporating Safety Into Electric and Autonomous Vehicles (EVs and AVs)\n\nSafety is of equal priority and importance in the design of both EVs and internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.\n\nWe have a dedicated high-voltage battery safety team that works to help protect the battery in a crash, which is similar to how we approach protecting fuel systems in ICE-powered vehicles. Our batteries are packaged below the seating area and are designed to be an integral part of the vehicle structure safety cage that helps to protect the occupants in the event of a crash. We assess the crash performance of the unique characteristics of a high-voltage battery system, and our vehicles are designed to shut down and isolate the electrical system in the event of a crash or flood to avoid the risk of electrical shock.\n\nWe play key roles in leading standards committees on battery safety through organizations like the Society of Automotive Engineers International and intend to remain an industry leader in this area.\n\nOur safety research and development extends to self-driving autonomous technology. AV development reflects all 12 safety elements in the NHTSA voluntary guidance, Automated Driving Systems 2.0\u2014A Vision for Safety.\n\nAcross the country, state and federal regulators and legislators are actively considering how to help foster and shape the evolution of AVs. GM is engaged with policymakers to advance AV-enabling legislation and regulations. In particular, we are focused on discussing our mobility offerings with city officials across the United States and around the world, given that urban settings are the environment in which our AVs will first launch commercially.\nA Culture of Safety\n\nOur workplace safety vision is to \u201cLive values that return people home safely. Every person. Every site. Every day.\u201d\n\nThis vision is guided by our safety policy, which applies to all employees and others working at our sites, including consultants, agents, sales representatives, distributors, independent contractors, third-party suppliers who work on GM premises and contract workers when performing work for GM.\n\nWorkplace safety is governed at the highest levels of the company through monthly operating reviews with global functional senior leaders, including the CEO and the Global Safety Leadership Council (GSLC), which comprises more than 20 senior global leaders. The GSLC determines strategic global safety direction and approves workplace safety initiatives, both of which are the responsibility of the vice president, Global Workplace Safety, who also provides a bimonthly update on the company\u2019s safety performance to the Board. Enterprise workplace safety risks and control initiatives are reviewed on an annual basis, and updates are provided to the Board\u2019s Risk and Cybersecurity Committee. Workplace safety reviews are also a part of every meeting of the full Board.\n\nIn 2021, COVID-19 continued to be a major focus of workplace safety management. We continued to align our practices with the protocols of each country where GM operates. GM employees were also encouraged to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and GM partnered with health systems, local health departments and national pharmacies to offer and administer the vaccine to employees.\n\nGM also published a vaccine guide for employees and continues to update a COVID-19 Employee Guide, which contains preparedness measures and a response plan for all employees. All employees are required to undergo training for COVID-19 protocols. Additionally, applying the \u201cwork appropriately\u201d philosophy has helped us reduce employee exposure to COVID-19. Where the work permits, employees have the flexibility to work where they can have the greatest impact on advancing our goals.\nGlobal Workplace Safety (GWS) Strategy\n\nOur comprehensive GWS strategy highlights five key focus dimensions, seen at left, that will enable us to achieve our vision to return people home safely as we aspire to zero injuries and fatalities. We have a five-year plan for each of these dimensions, which is refreshed annually with new initiatives to help us continuously improve and make progress toward this vision. The five dimensions include:\n\n**Culture: An Enterprise Safety Culture**\n\nWe strive for a culture where each person decides to keep themselves and their team members safe. In 2021, we continued our focus on how senior management can lead safety. To help create mindsets where people consider safety and health in all that we do, a new process called Safety and Health In Everyday Leadership Discussions (SHIELD) was implemented for use by senior leaders in meetings where strategic business decisions are made. During safety moments, in lieu of a traditional message, senior leaders ask probing questions within agenda topics of discussion to help create awareness and understanding of potential safety impacts. Using the SHIELD process has increased safety engagement during meetings and in overall decision-making.\n\nThe Manufacturing Leadership Team is also focused on improving the effectiveness of High-Risk Global Performance Standards, which address pedestrian/vehicle interaction, electrical safe work practices, lockout energy control and fall protection practices. Senior leaders visited 26 manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sites and conducted small group discussions and floor walks. As a result of these visits, senior leaders gained a deeper understanding of how standards are being applied and provided additional support to strengthen relationships and grow our safety culture.\n\nThe Employee Safety Concern Process is the most efficient way to identify and resolve workplace safety concerns. The process provides a structure for employees at manufacturing sites and office environments to report potential safety issues.\n\nIn 2021, we emphasized continued improvement on safe decision-making skills at the site level. Following a global effort in 2020 to conduct site culture assessments at major manufacturing facilities, we provided personalized, one-on-one coaching for more than 500 leaders at Ramos Arizpe Assembly in Mexico and at Spring Hill Assembly in Tennessee. Additional site culture assessments were conducted at our powertrain plant in Toledo, Ohio, GM Silao site in Mexico and other sites.\n\n**Knowledge: Hazard and Risk Identification**\n\nWe aim for every person, at every site, to be able to recognize hazards, understand risk levels and feel empowered to address safety concerns. In 2021, learning topics that impact serious injuries and fatalities (SIF) potential (e.g., Pre-task Planning, Management of Change and Lockout Energy Control) were conducted in more interactive, conversational forums versus traditional classrooms. Overconfidence, normalization of deviance and other biases which often lead to perceptual distortion and poor judgment were explained and openly discussed. This helps employees recognize situations where they may be inadvertently putting themselves or others in harm\u2019s way.\n\n**Systems: Workplace Safety Systems**\n\nOur global safety management system, Workplace Safety System (WSS), drives continuous improvement in all five global workplace safety dimensions: Culture, Risk Mitigation, Systems, Data and Knowledge. The system is aligned with our continuous improvement philosophy and with internationally recognized standards such as ISO 45001.\n\nIn 2021, our sites continued maturing and improving their WSS. Additionally, a cross-functional team collaborated to improve our safety governance system to align and interconnect site, regional and global safety boards. Efforts were focused on reducing SIF potential and supporting our performance assurance processes.\n\n**Workplace Safety System Governance**\n\n1. **1st Line of Defense**\n   - Annual Site Self-Assessment\n   - Site Directors\n\n2. **2nd Line of Defense**\n   - Regional/Global Validations\n   - Regional/Global Leaders\n\n3. **3rd Line of Defense**\n   - GM Audit Services\n   - Board of Directors\nData: Data-Driven Decisions\n\nAccessible, easy-to-analyze global safety data promotes data-driven decisions. A data management system is used to report, collect and analyze all safety information, including incident reports, audit findings, inspections, corrective actions and risk mitigation data. This data provides us meaningful information to develop risk mitigation plans that address issues, like hazards, with the most repetitive exposure, the most repetitive type of injuries and the most repetitive gaps detected during safety tours.\n\nIn 2021, we introduced a new SIF metric globally that allows GM to analyze exposure data and identify opportunities to proactively ensure safety. SIF subject matter expert teams were established at site, regional and global levels to validate accurate reporting and drive actions at the more effective levels of hierarchy (e.g., elimination, substitution and engineering). In 2022, GM will set specific improvement targets around leading SIF metrics to promote more effective control methods and monitor our exposure reduction efforts.\n\nAny loss of life or serious injury in the workplace is unacceptable. Our target is zero, so that every person who enters a GM facility leaves safe and unharmed.\n\nGM has a robust prevention program developed to promote the reporting and control of events that could result in severe harm or a fatality. Through the program we identify critical activities and develop global performance standards with mandatory safety controls. In 2021, we expanded our program and transitioned to tracking global performance through our new SIF metric and have established additional corrective actions focused to reduce SIF exposure and drive continuous improvement.\n\nRisk Mitigation\n\nWe aspire to do business with companies and contractors that share the same commitment to returning people home safely. Historically, most SIF events occurring on GM sites have involved contract labor. In order to manage the impacts of COVID-19 on our represented workforce, we temporarily leveraged contract labor at a higher rate than in past years. We work to provide contractors and temporary employees the necessary safety and process training to prevent safety occurrences and build a culture of safety among everyone. In 2021, we updated our Safety Contract Management calibration method to include a series of assessments to measure the engagement and safety culture of our contractors. We also expanded our attention to supplier pre-screening and on-site safety culture validation processes for suppliers to ensure they also share our value for people and safety.\n\nAs we transition to EVs, we continue to ensure our procedures and policies are updated to address any potential risks associated with new technologies. GM has formed a cross-functional team to help protect our employees. The team uses research, benchmarking and professional networking to create standards and develop training to support a safe environment for everyone working with EV components and vehicles. Although we are at the beginning of our journey, our team is already collaborating with others in the industry in the transition to an all-electric future.\nA work-related incident resulting in death. Our target is zero, so that every person who enters a GM facility leaves safe and unharmed.\n\nNumber of incidents that resulted in injuries or illnesses that required medical treatment beyond simple first aid treatment per 1,000,000 work hours. This metric helps to identify hazards, eliminate risks and drive reporting for all incidents so that we can identify and assess areas for improvement.\n\nPercent of Global Calls to Action closed on time. A Global Call to Action is a list of lessons learned and required corrective actions to be performed by each GM site globally in response to serious incidents that occurred on any GM site.\n\n1 In 2021, we are no longer tracking Sentinel Events Proactive as we transition tracking the potential for SIF.\n\n2 Lost workday case rate is defined as an incident that resulted in an injury or illness that required a worker to be away from work for one full work day or more after the date of injury.\nDeveloping Talented & Diverse People\n\nOur Strengths\n- Global workforce practicing behaviors aligned with our vision to become the most inclusive company in the world\n- Integrating new technology to better connect and engage with current and prospective talent\n- Providing a broad range of development opportunities to meet employees\u2019 diverse needs, including training for new skills, education reimbursement and stretch assignments\n- Leveraging our diverse network of employees, including our employee resource groups (ERGs) and newly established diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) committees to help attract and retain employees and achieve business results\n\nOur Opportunities\n- Competing for highly sought-after tech talent in critical skilled areas such as software development and engineering, user design and interface and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS)\n- Continuing to increase the representation of qualified women and people from traditionally underrepresented groups on our teams and in our succession planning processes\n- Driving greater equity throughout our business practices and talent management processes\nA Team That Includes Everybody\n\nPeople are our greatest asset and the reason behind our success. They are the key to realizing our vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion.\n\nTo continue making strides in our cultural transformation and to reach an all-electric future, we must recruit the most qualified diverse talent and foster great employee experiences in a culture where individuals can learn, develop and thrive. We gladly continue our journey of building a world-class diverse, equitable and inclusive organization at GM.\n\nEmployee experiences begin before joining GM, and we take that very seriously. Recruitment provides us with the largest opportunity to build a workforce with the diversity of thought and essential technical skillsets that are critical to achieving a better, safer and more equitable world for everyone. By starting with a diverse mix of candidates at the onset of our recruiting efforts, we are better positioned to advance the aspirations we have set for becoming the most inclusive company in the world.\n\nA key objective of our talent recruitment and assessment processes is to foster a mindset of inclusion and provide an experience that enables the most qualified pool of diverse candidates to find opportunities at GM. We are committed to increasing the variety of highly skilled employees and recognize that there are many pathways to success.\n\nWe know from one candidate to another high-quality talent is innately diverse: Everyone has their own unique background and brings their own unique experiences to a role\u2014and we are consistently architecting better ways for each candidate to shine in their own light during the application and interview processes. The GM Talent Acquisition Team combines their expertise in recruitment with various outreach strategies, including market analysis, sourcing, talent marketing and communications, to generate relevant, effective candidate interactions that contribute to GM\u2019s hiring of highly qualified and diverse talent aligned with our growth strategy.\n\nWe aim to provide inclusive job descriptions that focus on the capabilities and skills needed for the role. As candidates move through the recruitment process, they participate in structured interviews that help provide an objective platform to assess skill and behavioral alignment with the specific job needs. We also strive to create diverse teams of interviewers who reflect an inclusive mindset and provide different perspectives when assessing a candidate.\nA significant shift in our ability to attract diverse talent has been the adoption of our \u201cWork Appropriately\u201d philosophy. This approach accommodates on-site, remote and hybrid work options, depending on the role, and underscores the trust that we have in our employees to do their best work wherever they can have the greatest impact on achieving our goals. Leveraging \u201cWork Appropriately\u201d has provided us with a tremendous advantage in talent recruitment, as it enables many potential candidates to experience the opportunities that exist at GM without having to move.\n\nEngaging Every Employee\n\nWe strive every day to engage our employees in a meaningful way so that everyone feels connected to and united by our common Purpose, Vision and Values.\n\nWe measure engagement through our global Workplace of Choice survey, which goes to all employees. The full survey is conducted every two years in addition to shorter pulse surveys throughout the year. In 2021, more than 75,000 global salaried and represented employees provided feedback.\n\nWe strive for continuous improvement in engagement scores. To this end, GM\u2019s Senior Leadership Team and senior executives have aspirational engagement targets. All leaders also have a common annual performance management goal to emphasize their role in creating an engaged workplace culture that embraces feedback and recognition.\n\n>75,000 global salaried and represented employees participated in our Workplace of Choice pulse survey\n\nLearn more about other ways we are engaging our employees.\nDeveloping Everyone\u2019s Potential\n\nGrowth and development are top priorities for GM employees around the world. Learning continues to be a significant enabler of employees\u2019 growth and development. GM subscribes to a 70-20-10 philosophy of learning, where 70% of learning ideally occurs through on-the-job experiences, including stretch projects. The next 20% occurs through exposure activities, coaching, mentoring, participation in ERGs and other social activities. And the final 10% of learning happens through formal educational resources.\n\nLearning and development opportunities are available to employees at all levels across the enterprise. We believe learning is an experience that needs to be extended to employees in the course of their daily work.\n\nGetting Everybody in the Know\n\nAs we accelerate our all-electric future, it\u2019s important that all GM employees are knowledgeable about our growing electric vehicle (EV) products and services. In 2021, we launched several new internal channels to increase awareness, including:\n\n- A global microsite accessible on the home page of our intranet with the latest EV news, learnings tools and available resources.\n- A Degreed course dedicated to cultivating employee understanding of key areas of GM\u2019s electrification strategy.\n- A Yammer channel dedicated to internal EV conversations, questions and engagements.\n\nLearn more about employee opportunities for mentorship and growth on our GM Careers website.\n\nHow We Learn at GM\n\nRather than be prescriptive about learning, we encourage employees to build skills and seek out diverse experiences that interest them most through a variety of programs and tools.\n\n| PROGRAM | DESCRIPTION |\n|---------|-------------|\n| Degreed (Global) | A learning experience platform introduced in 2021 to support employees\u2019 learning during the flow of work.

Every year, GM\u2019s chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer presents a review of DEI to the Board. We also have an Inclusion Advisory Board (IAB) that is comprised of internal and external leaders and is led by our Chair and CEO. The IAB provides advice and recommendations to GM\u2019s Senior Leadership Team on DEI and cultural competence. Our chief DEI officer is responsible for the creation and execution of our strategy as well as helping drive and coordinate cross-functional DEI initiatives across all regions and all levels of the company.\n\nOur Journey\u2026to Become the Most Inclusive Company in the World\n\nAt General Motors, we recognize our journey to becoming the most inclusive company in the world is one that must be rooted in transparency, accountability and a commitment to cultivating a workforce that reflects the communities in which we live and work. We continue to take deliberate actions to ensure all areas of our business are supportive of a world-class, inclusive, equitable and diverse organization.\n\nBuilding DEI Maturity Across the Enterprise\n\nIn June 2020, GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra, announced our mission to become the most inclusive company in the world and commissioned the IAB.\n\nIn August 2020, \u201cBe Inclusive\u201d became the eighth GM behavior.\n\nExpanding critical conversations on DEI with employees around the globe.\n\nIncreasing capacity of the DEI Center of Excellence (COE) to accelerate reach and impact; global senior leaders leading DEI integration into the enterprise.\n\nGrowing global ERG impact while engaging functional DEI committees to help operationalize strategies on a local basis.\n\nWe are focused on simplifying our processes and procedures to enable us to move faster\u2014we want to embed DEI into every aspect of our business.\n\nMeet our Inclusion Advisory Board.\nIn addition to the IAB, other diversity-focused councils within our organization include:\n\n- GM Supplier Council\n- ERG Leader Council\n- Minority Dealer Development Council\n- Women\u2019s Dealer Advisory Council\n- One DEI Council\n\nWe are working consistently and diligently to integrate DEI in everything we do throughout the business and build DEI maturity across the enterprise by engaging in critical conversations with leaders and employees to bring everybody in on our journey to inclusion. We recognize our journey must be rooted in transparency, accountability and a commitment to cultivate a culture of innovation where everyone can be their true self, do their best work, feel valued and know that their voice matters.\n\n**Our DEI Strategy**\n\nAs we pursue our path to EV leadership, we are focused on three DEI strategic pillars: DEI Maturity, Transparency and Talent Innovation. Our DEI strategy is aligned with and integrated into our growth strategy. We continue to heavily invest in and strengthen our COE for DEI, increasing areas such as business intelligence and insights, growth of ERG impact, internal and external partnerships, global reach and scale and workforce design and innovation.\n\n**Driving DEI Maturity**\n\nWe are working with our leaders at all levels of the organization and with all employees to foster an inclusive culture, with an inclusive mindset, that continuously improves our interpersonal interactions with each other and our customers, suppliers and communities.\n\nFor example, GM recognizes that unconscious bias is one of the key impediments to building an inclusive culture, so we provided 1,300+ global leaders with live, interactive unconscious bias training in 2021. In addition, more than 125 global leaders received training to facilitate unconscious bias workshops in their respective workplaces around the world, setting up additional opportunities for live, interactive engagement and training. We also shared DEI Toolkits with 9,000 people leaders to help them drive dialogue on DEI topics with their staffs and introduced a new DEI people leader module for our learning platform, Degreed.\nIncreasing Transparency\n\nInclusivity demands transparency. We are committed to holding ourselves accountable and demonstrating progress to our internal and external stakeholders through data collection, analysis and disclosure. Publicly sharing certain information is an important part of accountability, for us and other companies, which is why we disclosed our consolidated Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)-1 Report for the first time in 2021 for 2020 data and committed to make similar disclosures in the future.\n\nData collection and analysis is also an important part of transparency. We recognize the importance of understanding where we are today in order to continue our progress. We have launched an Inclusivity Index as part of our global Workplace of Choice survey. In addition, we believe that transparency reaches beyond data. We also aim for transparency in professional communications and encourage open discussion of our DEI journey. We have amplified internal communication around DEI and we regularly share inclusive moments that matter.\n\nGM\u2019s DEI progress is regularly reviewed by the Senior Leadership Team and the Board for progress against key metrics: Inclusivity Index score, diversity in the overall GM population and diversity in the overall executive population. We also measure hiring, promotions, performance assessments, candidate pools and attrition as indicators of equity. In 2021, we were pleased to report that our efforts yielded increases in representation among several underrepresented groups, including women and racial and ethnic minorities.\n\nLeveraging Talent Innovation\n\nInnovation is at the heart of transforming GM technologies, and we are bringing that same innovative mindset to our HR processes and systems to improve equity. A skills-based approach to hiring and a focus on new pathways to enter our workforce are key. Some examples include:\n\n- **Being a founding member and Detroit-area lead of the OneTen coalition, 60 companies and leaders that aim to train, hire and advance 1 million Black Americans over a 10-year period into family-sustaining jobs with opportunities for advancement.**\n  - In year one, we hired **400+ individuals** associated with this partnership, exceeding our OneTen hiring commitment.\n\n- **Re-introducing our career re-entry program, Take 2** that targets anyone who has two or more years of experience in a field of work and has taken a break from that field for two or more years.\n\n- **Recruiting recent college graduates from more than 500 different U.S. colleges and universities.**\n\n- **Providing opportunities for more than 600 students annually through our paid college summer intern and co-op program, which has been recognized as one of the Top 100 Internship Programs.**\n\n- **Collaborating with organizations such as the Society of Women Engineers; the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers; American Indian Science and Engineering Society; Out in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics; National Society of Black Engineers; AfroTech and many other organizations that help provide us with a diverse slate of potential new hires.**\nCreating an Inclusive Culture\n\nWhen the goal to become the world\u2019s most inclusive company was announced, our DEI efforts intensified, and our sense of urgency accelerated. Today, the cultural transformation taking place within our company is as significant as the technology transformation driving our business growth. Indeed, the two are interrelated; at the intersection of these transformations is the potential for innovation, and significant and consistent innovation is required for GM to reach its zero, zero, zero vision.\n\nKey builders of this culture are the employees in our ERGs\u2014global voluntary, employee-led groups that serve as a resource for their constituent members and allies. ERGs help GM improve DEI maturity throughout our global business.\n\nWe have 11 ERGs, with many chapters across the United States and the world. Importantly, ERGs are fully open to anyone interested in participating. Nearly all ERGs have executive-led advisory councils to help them advance and address issues and opportunities. We\u2019re proud that all GM ERGs experienced growth in members and allies during 2021.\n\nWe are complementing the work of ERGs through the establishment of DEI cultural ambassadors as well as inclusion committees. This distributed model of DEI ensures that we are addressing DEI from both local and centralized perspectives. These ambassadors and committees are critical to our ability to address local opportunities as well as to scale certain DEI initiatives across the company. Furthermore, this approach enables everyone to lead DEI efforts\u2014not just as people leaders, but at the individual level.\n\nEmployee Resource Groups\n\nGM Women Making an Impact Around the World\n\nIn 2021, GM Women ERGs engaged in a variety of activities to support each other, dealer networks and their communities.\n\nUnited States\nFocused on wellness, development and partnerships to encourage everyone to become their own unique leader.\n\nMexico\nCreated a program, WOMENPOWER, emphasizing the elimination of cultural career stallers and stoppers.\n\nSouth America\nLaunched Women in Action, a continuous learning program for women at all levels to understand and overcome bias.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\nFormed DEI Committee to build a thriving, equitable and inclusive environment that supports leaders of diverse backgrounds.\n\nEgypt\nCelebrated International Women\u2019s Day by highlighting female talent and holding a session on inclusion.\n\nPhilippines\nHeld a webinar on women in traditionally male-dominated jobs.\n\nKorea\nShifted to a Diversity Council to ensure men and women were brought together to address issues and drive solutions that would benefit all.\n\nChina\nIntroduced a mentoring program to create two-way learning and broaden networking among women employees.\nPromoting Equity\n\nGM has long been a global leader in advocating for women\u2019s equity in the workplace. In 2021, women were in 31.9% of our top management positions within two levels of the CEO. The Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index is among the organizations that have recognized GM as a leader in gender equity.\n\nWe are committed to equal pay practices. Our commitment to the Equal Pay Pledge reflects the value we place on gender pay equity and our shared belief that employees\u2019 protected characteristics, including gender, should not factor into compensation decisions. As part of this commitment, GM has a rigorous annual process that involves measuring pay equity and making adjustments whenever unaccounted-for discrepancies are found.\n\nGM has a strong antidiscrimination policy that extends to all groups. We believe everyone deserves to work in an environment where they can be proud of who they are. GM ERGs help guide our strategy and understanding of important issues surrounding equity. GM Plus, our ERG focused on LGBTQ+ employees, for example, encourages allyship as one of the ways people can support the LGBTQ+ community, with about half of its over 1,000 members identifying as allies. In addition, the president of the GM Able ERG leads our disability advisory council.\n\n2021 Diversity Recognition\n\nGM has a strong antidiscrimination policy that extends to all groups. We believe everyone deserves to work in an environment where they can be proud of who they are. GM ERGs help guide our strategy and understanding of important issues surrounding equity. GM Plus, our ERG focused on LGBTQ+ employees, for example, encourages allyship as one of the ways people can support the LGBTQ+ community, with about half of its over 1,000 members identifying as allies. In addition, the president of the GM Able ERG leads our disability advisory council.\n\nDiverse Recruitment Successes\n\nDuring 2021, we took a number of actions to increase diversity within our workforce. When we restarted our Oshawa Assembly plant in Ontario, we recognized the opportunity to rebuild our approximately 1,200-person workforce to achieve gender parity. Through a recruitment process that helped to eliminate gender bias, the plant was able to re-open with women making up roughly half of the new workforce.\n\nSimilarly, GM Brazil held a successful Technical Rotation and Career Knowledge (TRACK) program aimed at accelerating inclusion of Black professionals in our workforce, especially in leadership positions. The TRACK program is GM\u2019s talent pipeline for future leaders. More than 5,700 candidates applied initially. Candidates went through a three-month multiphased process that ranged from online assessments to an everybody in session with GM leaders. Ultimately, 16 professionals\u2014seven of whom were female\u2014joined the GM Brazil team, with backgrounds ranging from engineering to psychology. The project concluded with onboarding activities at GM\u2019s plant in S\u00e3o Caetano.\nExtending Inclusivity Into the Market\n\nOur business seeks to support and foster diversity and inclusion within the global communities where we operate to provide the best customer experience and positively impact our broader society.\n\nDealer Diversity\n\nWe are proud that the coming year will see us celebrate the 50th anniversary of GM\u2019s Minority Dealer Development (MDD) Program. Established in 1972, it continues to serve as the longest running, industry-leading minority dealer program. In addition, GM is the first and only original equipment manufacturer to have a Women\u2019s Retail Network (WRN). This network is dedicated to growing a performance-driven, customer-focused and profitable dealer network by connecting highly qualified women dealers.\n\nGeneral Motors works diligently toward increasing the number of qualified diverse dealers; reaching a level of operational effectiveness that consistently meets or exceeds the general dealer population; encouraging and attracting diversity into retail organizations as dealer operators, managers and employees; and advocating that all GM dealerships provide a respectful environment for diverse customers and employees. In 2021, we made DEI training available to more than 100,000 dealer team members.\n\nWe are proud that our MDD and WRN programs consist of almost 600 diverse dealer partners in our dealer network, over 100 more than any other manufacturer. Our diverse dealers consistently outperform all other GM dealers in many key performance indicators and are among the most profitable of our retail partners.\n\nJustice & Inclusion Fund\n\nWe are driving generational change and impact through the Justice and Inclusion Fund with investments focused on health, education, economic empowerment and policy. Through the end of 2021, we committed $22 million to organizations such as The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Foundation; Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies; the Smithsonian Latino Center; and other organizations doing critical racial justice work. With these actions, we hope to impact 2.6 million people.\n\nUsing Our Voice\n\nWe believe that everyone has the responsibility to speak up in the presence of bias and injustice. We speak out, and will continue to do so, on social and racial equity issues. Our alignments in support of justice include signing a letter in support of the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. We are also signatories for many DEI efforts, including:\n\n- CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion Pledge\n- Coalition for the American Dream\n- Business Coalition for the Equality Act\n- The Dialogue Project\n- Gender and Diversity KPI Alliance\n\nGM also has a robust engagement with the Business Roundtable, of which GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra became the Chair at the start of 2022.\nTotal Rewards\n\nOffering competitive pay and benefits and promoting work-life balance further helps us to attract and retain an engaged and diverse workforce that enables the greatest possible returns on our investments in talent.\n\nTotal Rewards Program\n\nGM provides a comprehensive Total Rewards program to support our employees and their families around the globe. We prioritize a holistic approach to well-being, which includes support for employees' physical, emotional and financial wellness. Besides offering competitive wages, GM's benefit packages, which vary by country, may include health insurance, access to employee assistance program(s), life insurance, short- and long-term disability benefits, profit sharing, retirement and savings plans, paid time off, tuition assistance, vehicle discounts for employees and their family members and various other benefits employees can voluntarily elect.\n\nRecognition Program\n\nRecognition is an important part of the GM culture, and our salaried recognition program provides an online platform where employees across the globe can recognize and be recognized for living our company values and behaviors and for their contributions. This program is leveraged by 99% of our salaried employees. In 2021, there were approximately 1 million recognitions sent, 1.75 million recognitions received and 1.2 million comments shared. Additionally, we are working with our union partners to find new ways to recognize and engage represented employees.\n\nIn 2021\n\n~1M recognitions sent\n1.75M recognitions received\n1.2M comments shared\n\nUnited States\n\nPaid Family Leave/Disability Leave\n\nGM provides salaried employees up to 12 weeks of paid family leave per year to care for a family member with a serious health condition or to bond with a child added to their family through birth, adoption or foster care placement. In 2021, 1,919 employees took an average of 37 days of Paid Family Leave. This leave is provided in addition to the six to eight weeks of disability leave available to birth mothers. Employees are also eligible to apply for unpaid time off under GM's Dependent Care Leave policy, which provides job protection for up to 12 months.\n\nGM provides short-term disability benefits for up to one year with wage replacement ranging from 60% to 100% of base pay. In 2021, 12,587 employees took short-term disability leave, 14% of the U.S. workforce.\n\nAfter short-term disability benefits cease, company-provided long-term disability benefits are available to employees. Long-term disability benefits are payable up to age 65, depending on seniority and employee type, and provide for wage replacement at a rate between 50% to 60% of base pay.\n\nEmployee/Family Assistance\n\nThe Family Care Assistance program provides salaried employees access to back-up child/elder care, a subscription to Sittercity.com to source care needs and elder care support, and a program to provide specialized assistance to support employees with children with developmental needs.\n\nAdditionally, GM salaried employees are eligible to utilize a combined lifetime maximum benefit of up to $40,000 to reimburse for expenses associated with fertility treatments, adoption and/or surrogacy. Plus, personalized navigation assistance can be provided to find the best clinical care, adoption or donor-assisted reproduction support teams.\n\nRetirement, Savings and Profit Sharing\n\nRepresented employees, based on their service date, are eligible either to accrue service in the GM Represented-Rate Employees' Pension Plan or to receive a 6.4% GM Retirement Contribution and $1 per hour contribution, up to 40 hours per week (and up to 2,080 hours per year), to their GM Personal Savings Plan account (401(k)). The salaried workforce receives a 4% retirement contribution and the opportunity for a 4% matching contribution to their 401(k) account. Employees are also eligible for represented profit-sharing or salaried bonus payments tied to the company's achieving specific targets.\nCanada\n\nPregnancy and Parental Leaves\nIn conjunction with government benefits, employees are eligible for up to 75% of their base salary for up to 12 months, based on the qualifications for that specific leave type.\n\nPension and Savings\nGM provides a Defined Contribution Pension Plan for employees. The hourly plan requires a 4% employee contribution, and GM provides a 4% company contribution. If an employee contributes an additional 1%, GM will contribute an additional 2% of pensionable earnings. The salaried plan offers a 4% company contribution and the opportunity for a 4% match contribution toward a registered pension plan. All contributions are capped at current income tax limits.\n\nTuition Assistance\nSalaried employees are eligible for tuition reimbursement up to a maximum of $8,000 CAD per calendar year for undergraduate, graduate or doctorate-level education. After eight years of service, hourly employees can receive tuition assistance of $1,300 annual reimbursement for each eligible dependent enrolled in a full-time or certificate program at an accredited U.S. or Canadian university or community college.\n\nMexico\n\nPension and Savings\nGM provides salaried employees with a Defined Benefit Pension Plan provided they meet certain service and age requirements.\n\nIn addition, all salaried and hourly employees can contribute up to 13% of their salary (or the legal cap) into a Savings Fund each pay period. GM matches the amount up to the legal cap on an annual basis.\n\nOther Benefits\nSalaried employees with at least two years of seniority, and with leadership approval, may be reimbursed for up to 90% of their tuition costs (capped at MXN $100,000/year) based on class performance up to a maximum of three years. GM also provides a scholarship program for hourly employees\u2019 children in the amount of MXN $2,400 to MXN $6,000 per year, depending on the location.\n\nIn addition, employees receive a food coupon up to a legal cap or 11% of salary, whichever is greater. GM subsidizes a portion of the employees\u2019 meal costs at the on-site cafeteria, as well.\n\nFor all sites, GM provides a subsidized transportation/bus service for hourly employees.\n\nFor hourly and salaried employees, GM provides additional vacation days above regulatory requirements and pays above the mandatory requirements for the Christmas bonus and Sunday/vacation time for certain locations.\n\nBrazil\n\nPaid Time Off/Additional Assistance\nFemale employees receive 180 days of maternity leave and are eligible for childcare assistance; according to the collective agreement of their locality.\n\nFemale employees are entitled to a breastfeeding leave for two half-hour periods during the working day, or eight consecutive days after maternity leave until the child is six months old and 30 days of paid rest in the event of a miscarriage; according to the collective agreement of their locality.\n\nTuition Assistance\nTuition is paid at 50% for employees\u2019 undergraduate, graduate or doctorate-level education.

Employees will also receive a clothing allowance of 500 yuan at the anniversary date of employment. Additionally, an internal housing fund is paid to local employees to support them in purchasing or renting a house.\nLabor Relations\n\nAt GM, manufacturing is our competitive advantage in building our all-electric future. That means the future of our business, as well as the future of mobility, rests largely in the hands of our represented employees. Their success and the growth of our business are inextricably linked.\n\nAs we transition to an all-electric future, collaboration with our union partners and support for our represented employees underscore the competitive and unmatched business advantage they bring to GM. This experienced and skilled workforce comprises more than 95,000 industrial problem-solvers on our manufacturing team, who, collectively, have 1.4 million years of experience. It is critical to bring this workforce along on our EV journey.\n\nSince the beginning of 2021 (through March 2022), GM has announced the creation or retention of almost 7,000 jobs as part of our investment in America. Our commitment was clearly demonstrated in early 2022 when GM announced a $7 billion investment in four Michigan manufacturing sites, expected to create 4,000 new jobs and retain 1,000 jobs. The investment includes a new battery cell plant, the conversion of an assembly plant to EV production and upgrades in production capabilities for two other assembly plants.\n\nEqually as important as investments in facilities are investments in our workforce to ensure they possess the required skills to successfully launch our future EVs and AVs. As an example, the GM Automotive Manufacturing Electrical College is a new immersive training program providing participants the opportunity to train in both classroom and hands-on settings for a future role on a launch team at one of GM\u2019s vehicle assembly facilities. We also restructured the Electrical Apprentice Program to include the latest technologies focusing more on Programmable Logic Controllers, robotics and vision systems. The goal is to equip participants with the technical skills needed to perform electrical-based job duties before they reach the floor of a manufacturing site.\n\nWorking Collaboratively With Union Partners\n\nHealthy union relationships are built on effective communication. We engage with our union partners daily and provide opportunities for them to offer input into our processes. An ongoing priority is to ensure that our represented employees feel empowered as members of our global manufacturing and operations team and that their voices and ideas are heard on topics such as safety and quality improvement.\nWe also strive to understand and address represented workforce concerns to capitalize on opportunities for them. In 2019, GM ratified a new four-year labor agreement covering employees at 55 United Auto Workers (UAW)-represented sites across the United States. This agreement provides GM-represented workers with a world-class wage, benefit and profit-sharing package, rewarding their hard work and supporting families and communities across the United States. Importantly, the agreement also establishes a National Committee on Advanced Technology, made up of both union and management representatives. We have covered technologies such as additive manufacturing, autonomous robots and drones and unique operator interfaces in our most advanced assembly facilities. These opportunities have been implemented to upskill our workforce in the area of electrification. The committee meets at least quarterly to discuss the impact of electrification and other advanced technologies on our represented workforce. In addition, the agreement outlines collaborative initiatives to enhance the health and safety of manufacturing employees as well as other aspects of the production process.\n\nSupporting Represented Employees Through Business Challenges\n\nThe global pandemic and associated supply chain shortages during the past two years have been challenging for our operations. Throughout, GM has prioritized taking care of our represented employees by ensuring the health and safety of all who are on the job. In particular, we have had to creatively manage the complex and fluid global semiconductor shortage. This has called for inventive ways to sustain production and prioritization of our highest-demand, capacity-constrained products\u2014all while developing sustainable, long-term supply chain solutions. Our responsible employment philosophy extends to when workers are displaced because of a plant production adjustment. During recent adjustments, we have supported workers through various measures, including on-the-job training programs and various types of paid leave and supplemental unemployment insurance.\n\nAs the pandemic extends into its third year, we continue to support all of our employees in innovative ways with initiatives ranging from mailing masks to employees\u2019 homes for their families for holiday gatherings and holding vaccination clinics at many of our facilities for employees, to providing paid time off for certain quarantine situations.\n\nUnion Partnerships\n\nGM works with about 28 unions globally, representing approximately 99% of our represented workforce, or 61% of our total global workforce, who are covered by collective bargaining agreements.\n\nGM\u2019s relationships with labor unions are healthy and stable partnerships aimed at optimizing the outcomes for both the employees and the business.\n\nWe manage our labor relations regionally, with a global focus. The labor relations responsibility is held by the global manufacturing leader, with partnerships that go to the highest level of the GM organization. Regular meetings are held with our union partners, starting with quarterly meetings between our CEO and UAW leadership. Regional vice presidents of manufacturing conduct face-to-face meetings with the unions when visiting the manufacturing sites; manufacturing directors meet with the local unions at plant sites regularly; and plant managers around the globe discuss business issues daily with local unions. These meetings provide critical input for making business decisions in a dynamic environment where schedules, economic swings and products are ever changing. GM leadership devotes time to work productively with our union partners and ensure they are updated on the business and pertinent issues.\n\nWe work continuously with our union partners around the world to address unique issues within their respective markets. During 2021 alone, examples included:\n\n- In the United States, renovating the former Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant to reopen as Factory ZERO following a $2.2 billion investment to build a variety of all-electric trucks and SUVs (Grand Opening was November 17, 2021).\n- In Korea, rebuilding GM factories to support the introduction of new models, which included visiting our plants in the United States and Mexico to better share learnings.\n- In Mexico, working on compliance issues around the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement.\nUpholding Human Rights\n\nOur Strengths\n\n- Committing to respect all internationally recognized human rights and human rights defenders\n- Working cross-functionally to understand and manage human rights risks and impacts\n- Sharing our commitments with our global workforce across a range of platforms\n- Deepening relationships with stakeholders worldwide and seeking out ways to collaborate\n\nOur Opportunities\n\n- Promoting protection of human rights across our global operations, joint ventures and supply chain\nAs described in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), governments have a responsibility to protect the human rights of their people, and businesses such as GM have a responsibility to respect the human rights of people. A key part of this is recognizing and addressing potential adverse impacts a business can have on people throughout its enterprise, and taking steps to prevent, mitigate and, where appropriate, remediate those impacts.\n\nGM is committed to bring everyone along as our business, industry and world make the transition to a lower-carbon future. This includes respecting the human rights of all people.\n\nAt GM, we understand that long-term success starts with a company\u2019s value system and a principled approach to doing business. In 2021, the Board\u2019s Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee approved an updated and strengthened Human Rights Policy. The Board also formally added human rights oversight to the Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee\u2019s annual responsibilities. It regularly reviews GM\u2019s human rights-related policies and strategies and conducts an annual review of GM\u2019s human rights practices and responsible sourcing practices. Other committees of the Board, including the Executive Compensation Committee, the Risk and Cybersecurity Committee and the Audit Committee, also engage with human rights-related matters as needed. For example, when relevant, the Executive Compensation Committee addresses certain human capital management matters, the Risk and Cybersecurity Committee addresses supply chain risks and the Audit Committee oversees GM\u2019s ethics and compliance program.\n\nHuman rights is an important issue addressed both by the Board and cross-functionally by senior leaders across the company. Our chief sustainability officer is responsible for GM\u2019s Human Rights Policy and works cross-functionally with GM\u2019s Human Resources; Diversity, Equity and Inclusion; Labor Relations; Ethics and Compliance; and Global Purchasing and Supply Chain Teams, among others, to understand and address potential human rights risks and impacts.\n\nHighlights from GM\u2019s updated Human Rights Policy include:\n\n- A commitment to respect all internationally recognized human rights, including those described in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization\u2019s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (the ILO Core Conventions), and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\n- A commitment to respect the rights of human rights defenders, people who speak up on behalf of those whose rights may be threatened. The policy states that GM will \u201cneither tolerate nor knowingly contribute to threats, intimidation or attacks against human rights defenders in relation to our operations\u201d and encourages our suppliers to make the same commitment.\n\n- An underscored commitment to respect the rights of people who may be particularly vulnerable\u2014Indigenous peoples, women, children, migrant workers and people with disabilities, among others, and our expectation that suppliers share in this commitment.\n\nThe Policy applies to all of GM\u2019s global operations, including joint ventures in which we have managerial control, and also contains obligations for suppliers and contractors. The Policy includes ethical recruitment practices, diversity, antiharassment, prohibition of unlawful discrimination, support of women\u2019s rights and equal pay, individual privacy, and other human rights protections.\n\nAs a member of the UNGC, GM endorses a framework of principles in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment and anticorruption. We are committed to these principles and are actively implementing them. Visit the 2021 Sustainability Supplement for more information.\nreporting and nonretaliation policies. Suppliers and business partners we contract with are expected to make commitments to human rights as well, including the ILO\u2019s Core Conventions against forced labor, child labor, discrimination and harassment, and protecting freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. Suppliers are also expected to comply with laws on safety and working conditions.\n\nGM\u2019s zero-tolerance policy against the use of child labor, and all forms of modern slavery and forced labor, is stated in our Supplier Code of Conduct and Conflict Minerals Policy. Our Supplier Code of Conduct details our expectations for contacted suppliers and business partners to comply with all laws, including safety, data, freedom of association and collective bargaining laws. The Supplier Code of Conduct also states that suppliers and business partners we contract with will not harass or discriminate against employees, nor tolerate corrupt business practices. Suppliers are expected to cascade similar expectations through their own supply chains.\n\nIdentifying Potential Impacts\n\nIn order to effectively prevent and mitigate potential impacts to people, the UNGPs identify what those potential impacts could be and prioritize them by determining which are the most severe and most likely, in a process known as a human rights saliency assessment. Salient human rights issues for a company are those that are most at risk of the most severe impacts through a company\u2019s activities and business relationships. GM is engaged in a saliency assessment process. In 2021, as a part of this process, we conducted desktop research, reviewed industry analyses and began connecting with external stakeholders. We also held a series of interactive internal capacity building and exploratory workshops with leaders from across the enterprise and our geographic footprint in order to identify and prioritize potential human rights-related impacts.\n\nIn the series of workshops with a cross-functional working group, we looked at our value chain, considered potential impacts to people throughout our value chain, and then considered the severity and likelihood of each impact. Through this process, the working group arrived at an initial set of potential impacts to consider. In 2022, GM will refine and validate the potentially salient human rights impacts with internal and external stakeholders.\n\nCommunicating Our Commitments\n\nOur goal is to have our entire global workforce understand our commitments, including awareness of our Human Rights Policy and how to access it. To that end, together with our Internal Communications Team, we\u2019ve developed a global communications strategy for our Human Rights Policy that leverages our internal company site (Socrates), our internal announcement and discussion platform (Yammer), our employee resource groups, leadership at each of our global plant locations and location-specific private Facebook pages as channels to reach as much of our global workforce as possible. The Human Rights Policy is available in eight languages to promote ease of access and understanding.\n\nSaliency Assessment Process\n\n1. **Evaluate**\n   - Consider, through a cross-functional workshop, severity and likelihood of potential impacts to people across our value chain.\n\n2. **Validate**\n   - Develop and refine potentially salient human rights impacts with internal and external stakeholders.\n\n3. **Commit**\n   - Act to prevent, mitigate and remediate potential human rights impacts to which we may contribute, as detailed in our Human Rights Policy.\n\nWhile we recognize that nearly all of the potential impacts identified are by nature systemic and not limited to GM or even the automotive industry, we take seriously our responsibility to work to identify, prevent, mitigate and remediate potential human rights impacts to which we may contribute, as detailed in our Human Rights Policy.\n\nThe results from our initial saliency assessment workshops are an important jumping off point that we will build upon. We recognize that effective, regular stakeholder engagements are an important part of identifying and addressing potential human rights impacts. We view the saliency assessment process as an ongoing exercise with impacts and prioritizations that may, and likely will, change over time.\nPreventing and Mitigating Impacts\n\nHistorically, we have relied on trainings as a tool to prevent human rights-related issues from arising, as well as robust reporting and internal review mechanisms to rapidly identify and respond to issues, if and when they arise. We will use the findings from our saliency assessment to further strengthen our strategy as we continue to evolve our management of potential human rights impacts.\n\nIn the near future, we plan to take a closer look at our salient issues to gain additional understanding of the risks.\n\nIn parallel with developing action plans, we intend to build out management systems to enhance understanding, ownership and accountability over our salient issues.\n\nEngaging With Stakeholders\n\nStakeholder engagement is an important part of addressing human rights matters. We value the relationships that we have formed with many of our stakeholders and look forward to future opportunities to connect, learn and collaborate.\n\nWe engage with stakeholders through many forums. We believe it is important to hear directly from stakeholders, or their representatives, who may be impacted by our business. It is through these conversations that trust is built, and they provide an invaluable opportunity for us to learn and to co-create potential solutions, when appropriate.\n\nFor example, through dialogues facilitated by the Development Partnership Institute, we engaged with representatives of Indigenous mining communities in a number of countries, including Australia and Canada. From these conversations, we heard concerns that Indigenous interests and perspectives were frequently not included in sustainability-related frameworks, despite claims of inclusivity and comprehensiveness. We also heard that Indigenous people appreciate opportunities to engage in and more fully understand the value chain. In response, we are actively exploring opportunities to build relationships and communication channels with communities closer to the origin of our supply chains.\n\nOne example of this is our engagement with multistakeholder initiatives such as the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber, which includes smallholder farmers from sourcing regions in Asia and Africa.\n\nWe are also working to further bolster our due diligence processes and have announced a new partnership with the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance to promote comprehensive third-party assessments and certifications, in addition to continuing to work closely with the Responsible Minerals Initiative, as discussed in the Supply Chain section. Additionally, we are updating our Supplier Code of Conduct to emphasize our expectation that all suppliers share in our commitments to respect human rights. We are also expanding our compliance efforts to gain more insight into whether suppliers are living up to expectations. In 2022, we plan to launch a new platform that will help educate and build supplier capacity around human rights and other critical sustainability areas.\n\nRead GM\u2019s Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement.\n\nLearn more in Supporting Supplier Responsibility section.\nSupporting Supplier Responsibility\n\nOur Strengths\n\n- Expanding work with our suppliers to utilize EcoVadis and CDP as sustainability platforms to collect data and gain further insight into their sustainability and compliance practices\n- Continuing to collaborate and share best practices with our suppliers to strengthen progress toward shared goals\n- Creating new relationships and leveraging existing relationships to bring innovative ideas and new approaches to our supply chain\n\nOur Opportunities\n\n- Accelerating the pace of change within our supply chain to address sustainability risks and opportunities\n- Enhancing visibility into the lower tiers of our supply chain to further mitigate social and environmental risks\n- Sourcing sustainable materials at greater scale that are critical to the continued development and widespread deployment of electric vehicles (EVs)\nWhy Supplier Relationships Matter\n\nOur goal of a zero-emissions future is dependent on the broad-scale commercialization of EVs. That future begins with a supply chain that can provide us with the components and materials necessary to produce EVs, including advanced batteries and other technologies. This makes supplier relationships more critical than ever to fulfill our vision.\n\nOur global supply chain spans thousands of businesses and is built on strong, transparent and trusted relationships. These relationships, which our Global Purchasing and Supply Chain (GPSC) organization manages, are critical to ensuring product quality, availability and affordability for our customers. By seeking to be the customer of choice for suppliers, we strive to improve business competitiveness, mitigate business risks, improve quality and efficiency in our value streams, and maximize our influence in addressing societal concerns.\n\nOur supply chain strategy flows from GPSC\u2019s Priority Wheel, pictured at right. The Priority Wheel is a well-established set of priorities aligning supply chain objectives, with customer focus at the core. It also encourages us to gain supplier input on major process improvements and other issues that may affect them. Our vice president of GPSC is responsible for executing the objectives in our Priority Wheel.\n\nWe have made significant progress in strengthening our supplier relationships as shown in Plante Moran\u2019s 2021 annual Working Relations Index, where we achieved a score of 289, a 20-point improvement compared to the previous year.\n\nOur global supply chain strategy flows from GPSC\u2019s Priority Wheel, pictured at right.

We are proactively and aggressively pursuing responsibly sourced materials at strategic tiers of the supply chain and exploring where investment and partnerships can yield benefits and untapped value that lowers costs of advanced technologies. In 2021, we have advanced several initiatives, including:\n\n- **A strategic supplier agreement with Wolfspeed, Inc.** to develop and provide silicon carbide power device solutions for GM\u2019s EV programs. The devices are expected to enable more efficient EV propulsion systems to extend EV range.\n\n- **A nonbinding Memorandum of Understanding with GE Renewable Energy** to evaluate opportunities to improve supplies of heavy and light rare earth materials and magnets, as well as copper and electrical steel, used in manufacturing of both EVs and equipment that generates renewable energy for electricity. The initial focus of the collaboration will be on creating a North America and Europe based supply chain of vertically integrated magnet manufacturing that both companies will use in the future. Metal alloys and finished magnets produced from rare earth materials are critical components used in manufacturing electric motors for automotive and renewable power generation. The companies will also work together to help establish new supply chains for additional materials, such as copper and eSteel, that are used in automotive traction motors and renewable power generation.\n\n- **A strategic relationship and commercial collaboration with Controlled Thermal Resources** to support development of U.S.-sourced, low-cost lithium from the Salton Sea area of California. The lithium will be produced through a closed-loop, direct extraction process that results in a smaller physical footprint, no production tailing and near-zero carbon dioxide emissions when compared to traditional processes such as pit mining or evaporation ponds.\n\n- **A long-term supply agreement with MP Materials**, the owner of America\u2019s only active and scaled rare earth production site in California. GM has agreed to support MP Materials\u2019 efforts to become a vertically integrated, technically qualified and approved North American manufacturer of advanced magnets.\n\n- **GM and POSCO Chemical have agreed to create a joint venture to build a factory in North America to manufacture Cathode Active Material (CAM), a key battery material that is the most significant determinant of cell costs, quality and performance. GM and POSCO share a vision and are leveraging our combined experience, scale and expertise to develop a sustainable, ethically sourced and competitive supply chain for CAM inputs to support the launch of a North American CAM manufacturing facility.**\nSupply Chain Engagement\n\nGPSC advances how GM and our suppliers achieve mutual success by providing better product quality, cost and durability to our customers.\n\n| PROGRAM | DESCRIPTION |\n|---------|-------------|\n| GM Supplier Business Council (SBC) | The GM SBC consists of 20 suppliers who meet quarterly with our GPSC Leadership Team. Within the SBC, the Sustainability Sub-Council serves as a sounding board for GPSC\u2019s sustainability strategy. The Sustainability Sub-Council consists of SBC and non-SBC members who are recognized for their work in sustainability and a team of cross-functional GM employees. We look to this Sub-Council as the voice of our greater supply base on topics of sustainability. |\n| GM Supplier Business Meetings | GM Supplier Business Meetings are held regularly throughout the year as a global webcast where GM global topics are shared. GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra addresses this group annually. Suppliers who participate in this webcast represent approximately 85% of our annual purchases for parts and services. |\n| GM Supplier Safety Council | The Supplier Safety Council serves as an open and collaborative forum to exchange safety policies and share best practices across the supply base. Any GM supplier is welcome to access the Council\u2019s database to learn safety practices that can be shared within their own operations and supply base. |\n| GM SupplyPower | GM SupplyPower is an internet portal used by GM to share information, including sustainability event information, policies, guidelines, standards and reports, and best practices with suppliers. It includes a section devoted to sustainability. We encourage suppliers to facilitate discussions with their organizations on important information posted in SupplyPower. |\n| Supplier of the Year | Our Supplier of the Year program recognizes top performers. In 2021, 135 suppliers from 16 countries were awarded and recognized, including 17 first-time winners. The 2021 program also included a new Overdrive Award with criteria including supplier sustainability innovation. |\n| Communication Tools | Communication tools\u2014AwareLine, Speak Up For Safety and others\u2014are used by suppliers and our own employees to raise concerns, including those relating to potential human rights and environmental violations. Speak Up!, GM\u2019s Non-Retaliation Policy, protects GM employees from retaliation as a result of raising concerns. Our Supplier Code of Conduct prohibits suppliers from retaliating or harassing their employees for utilizing grievance mechanisms. |\n\nAcross the globe, we hold various webinars and work with third parties to provide external training to improve supplier operations, primarily in the areas of environmental management, workplace conditions, sustainability, ethics and human rights. In 2021, we conducted 18 supplier educational sessions covering topics that included energy reduction, conflict mineral reporting template requirements, supplier sustainability goal-setting and sustainable logistics.\nIndustry Collaboration\n\nWe collaborate with, and are active members of, organizations inside and outside the automotive industry to develop sustainable and socially responsible supply chain programs.\n\nWe work closely with many industry- and supply chain-focused organizations, including the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG), where we actively participate in the Responsible Materials Work Group, along with several of its subgroups, and sit on the Corporate Responsibility Steering Committee. GM has partnered with the AIAG, of which we are a member, to provide training to our employees and suppliers through their Supply Chain Sustainability eLearning. The training reflects the Automotive Industry Guiding Principles, which are comprised of three pillars: Business Ethics, Environment, and Human Rights & Working Conditions. Human rights training topics include child labor and young workers, wages and benefits, working hours, forced labor, freedom of association, health and safety, harassment and nondiscrimination. In 2020, 400 GM employees took the AIAG training; this number increased to 475 in 2021, covering 17 different countries within GM\u2019s global footprint. In Spring 2022, AIAG will be launching a more robust sustainability eLearning platform that expands on the content of the current training. This interactive and comprehensive platform will engage trainees in scenario-based learning that references specific challenges within the sustainability sphere. GM is serving as a sponsoring company to help finance the tool, and, as a result, training will be free to suppliers. GM expects to begin rolling out the AIAG sustainability eLearning platform to a portion of our supply base mid-year 2022.\n\nCompliance with IATF 16949 Quality Standards (IATF 16949) is a requirement for GM Tier I suppliers. This third-party certification requires suppliers to employ responsible supply chain practices and to have policies on employee code of conduct, antibribery and ethics escalation policy (\u201cwhistle-blowing\u201d).\n\nLearn more in the Upholding Human Rights section of this report.\nIntegrating Sustainability Into Our Supply Chain\n\nGM is driving toward an all-electric future with a vision of everybody in. This vision extends beyond GM and includes our suppliers. We know that only with our suppliers\u2019 commitment will we achieve our vision of zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion.\n\nWe take pride in knowing that many of our suppliers are dedicated to protecting our planet and fostering healthy work environments. In recognition of this commitment, in 2021, we began inviting Tier I suppliers to sign General Motors\u2019 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Partnership Pledge. Our ESG Partnership Pledge embraces sustainability in a holistic manner, focusing on commitments related to environmental, social and governance topics. Suppliers pledging to improvements in these three pillars helps us all accomplish our shared goals of reducing economy-wide carbon emissions and serving our communities.\n\nFor the environmental pillar, we ask suppliers to commit to carbon neutrality for their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions relevant to products or services a supplier provides to GM. The timeline for a supplier to reach carbon neutrality is based on their industry, listed at right. GM selected the listed carbon neutrality dates for each supplier industry based on the technology available to achieve a realistic yet ambitious glidepath.\n\nFor the social pillar, we ask suppliers to achieve or exceed a threshold score within the EcoVadis system in the areas of Labor and Human Rights as well as Ethics. Likewise in the governance pillar, suppliers are asked to achieve or exceed a threshold score in the area of Sustainable Procurement within EcoVadis. These scores show a supplier\u2019s commitment to developing a comprehensive social responsibility program as well as robust environmental and social programs within their own supply chains.\n\nWe ask suppliers to provide near-term results by obtaining a minimum score of 50 in the EcoVadis Human Rights, Ethics and Sustainable Procurement Pillars.\nThe cross-functional GPSC Sustainability Team is leading efforts to integrate sustainability into all aspects of our supply chain. Focus areas include culture and communication; energy; finance; strategy and policy; supplier engagement; supplier performance and reporting; supply chain; packaging and logistics; and sustainable materials.\n\nWe recently announced the GM Supplier Renewable Energy Solutions program in collaboration with Shell Energy. This innovative energy pilot program offers certain suppliers special pricing on renewable energy for electricity, along with other benefits such as complementary carbon tracking. All participants in the program will receive 5% Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) matched to their energy use, and CO2 tracking. Plus, they have the option to purchase additional RECs to help address their carbon footprint efforts.\n\nAnother key achievement in 2021 was the publication of a GM Sustainability Partner Guide and Framework to our Tier I suppliers, which communicates our supply chain goals, priorities and Framework to our Tier I suppliers, allowing each supplier to be recognized for supporting GM\u2019s sustainability goals.\n\nAssessing Performance\n\nIn 2021, we furthered our commitment to create a more sustainable supply chain by working with EcoVadis to rate and understand the sustainability performance of our supply base. EcoVadis allows us to gain visibility of the management systems suppliers have in place to support advancement of the environment, labor and human rights, ethics and sustainable procurement. Working with our suppliers and EcoVadis through their platform, scorecard and performance improvement tools in 2021, we have established a sustainability performance benchmark representing 83% of GM\u2019s Direct Tier I strategic spend. The average score of all GM\u2019s rated suppliers is 51.7 out of 100, which is 15% (or 8.1 points) higher than the average of all suppliers rated by EcoVadis in 2021. Moving into 2022 and beyond, with the integration of EcoVadis in 2021, GM is setting expectations to drive rapid supplier sustainability improvement to meet our ambitious supply chain sustainability goals.\n\nGeneral Motors Sustainable Purchasing Program Supplier Goals Framework\n\n| Level | All Tier 1 Suppliers | Enrolled Suppliers* |\n|-------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| 0     | Compliance           | Terms and Conditions Supplier Code of Conduct | Score in EcoVadis CDP participation Industry specific participation (e.g. GPSNR) |\n|       | GM\u2019s baseline requirements for our suppliers. | Materiality assessment Goals in all 3 sustainability pillars (relevant, impactful, transparent, improving, United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (UN SDG) linked) | \u2265 3% year-over-year absolute CO2 reduction (Scope 1 & 2) |\n| 1     | Commitment           | Making sustainability a priority, creating alignment, setting goals and achieving results. | Actively support GM\u2019s commitment to sustainable materials and packaging Strong social sustainability commitment |\n|       | Growth               | Furthering commitment while expanding sustainability into one\u2019s supply chain. | \u2265 4% year-over-year absolute CO2 reduction (Scope 1 & 2) Sustainable procurement program Supplier to cascade goals into own supply base Minimum ratings (CDP, EcoVadis) |\n| 2     | Leadership           | A true accomplishment, recognizing a supplier as a pacesetter in sustainability. | Industry Leader Leading innovator Ambitious targets (Scope 1, 2 & 3, SBTi, Zero Waste) Proactive actions Life cycle assessment (full) |\n\n* Initial enrolled suppliers to include SSE suppliers, key indirect and key logistics suppliers.\nAs we are all met with the realities and consequences of climate change, our deep relationships with suppliers will help us innovate to find industry solutions. The issues we face today cannot be solved by one company, or even one nation, which is why at GM we are taking an \u2018everybody in\u2019 approach that includes each one of our suppliers.\u201d\n\nSHILPAN AMIN\nGM Vice President, Global Purchasing and Supply Chain\u2014Introduction of GM Sustainability Partner Guide and Framework (2021)\nManaging Supply Chain Impact Through Life Cycle Analysis\n\nLife cycle analysis, using environmental extended input/output analysis from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) EEIO 2.0 database, allows us to estimate the environmental impacts of our 18,936 suppliers. The analysis is broken down by industry and tier to identify which products in our supply chain contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water consumption and land use.\n\nSupplier GHG Impact by Vehicle Component\n\nWe analyze environmental supplier impacts at the vehicle component level to identify potential priority areas for carbon reduction. This helps us monitor and manage sustainability trends within our supply base as automotive technologies change.\n\nGHG Impact by Supplier Tier & Industry\n\nIn our supply chain, the largest GHG and water impacts occur among Tier II suppliers. Purchased goods and services represent 13% of our total carbon emissions which we are working to reduce.\n\n1 GHG Data is for calendar year 2020 and represents our most recent analysis. The analysis excludes our Joint Ventures.\n\n2 Includes purchased goods and services Scope 3 category one.\nSupplier Engagement and Training on GM Environmental Standards\n\nThe GPSC Sustainability Team employs multiple avenues for supplier engagement on environmental topics, as the following examples demonstrate.\n\n**Energy Treasure Hunts**\nWe conduct energy treasure hunts with suppliers to drive energy- and water-reduction efforts at Tier I and Tier II supplier facilities. The program's success is embedded in its collaborative framework, identifying potential energy reduction and financial savings opportunities at suppliers' manufacturing facilities. In 2021, GM conducted this analysis with five suppliers: Lear, Kongsberg Automotive, Superior Industries, Tenneco and Adient. These treasure hunts collectively provided recommendations to save 3,300 MWh of energy and 6,660 cubic meters of water, as well as eliminating 3,158 metric tons of CO2 emissions.\n\n**Sustainable Steel Summit**\nAs we continue to examine our environmental impact, we recognize steel is a major contributor to carbon emissions. In order to address this impact, GM hosted our first Sustainable Steel Summit focused on engaging key steel suppliers in a collaborative discussion about the industry's most pressing issues, including carbon emission reduction strategies. The Summit began with a leadership kickoff message, followed by emerging renewable energy for electricity technology, a look into GM supplier sustainability and a carbon neutral roadmap. It concluded with a moderated discussion with all attendees. GM leadership facilitated the discussion topics around the challenges of moving toward \u201cgreen steel\u201d and next steps in developing a shared sustainability plan with GM material partners. The summit helped solidify GM\u2019s partnership with steel supplier Nucor, effectively becoming the first customer for Econiq, Nucor\u2019s new range of net zero carbon steel products.\n\n**Energy Symposium**\nAlso in 2021, we held an Energy Symposium focused on renewable energy and carbon neutrality. The two-day event provided insight into renewable energy for electricity as a sound business decision. The GPSC Sustainability Team, suppliers and stakeholders discussed carbon neutrality and highlighted immediate tangible opportunities and resources available to accelerate action. The first day was open to the public; employees, suppliers and stakeholders invested or interested in carbon neutrality and renewable energy were invited to join. The second day was directed toward energy conservation practitioners\u2014site energy leaders and utility managers.\n\n**Sustainability in Logistics**\nGM participates in various freight sustainability programs, including the EPA\u2019s SmartWay Partnership, which we have been a proud member of since 2013. In 2021, we increased our engagement with the SmartWay program by encouraging all our eligible logistics suppliers to join. As a result, participation in the program increased by one-third, with a commitment from U.S. and Canadian carriers that represents 99% of our truck and rail spend. Through participation in Transporte Limpio, a freight efficiency program administered by Mexico\u2019s Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources, we are expanding freight efficiency efforts to include Mexican truck carriers.\n\nOur GM Logistics Team aggressively evaluates our logistics network for optimization opportunities, studying methods for improving efficiency and emissions reduction through redesigning routes, changing modes and adjusting frequency. In 2021, the team implemented a program to include emissions metrics in business case analyses. The integration of carbon calculation methodology allows for increased visibility of CO2 emissions when reviewing and considering various network scenarios.\n\nOur GM Logistics Team is also focused on increasing collaboration with our carriers, industry leaders and peers. In 2021, GM held its first Global Logistics Sustainability Workshop with approximately 500 attendees from 150 logistics suppliers. Also in 2021, the EPA invited our GM Logistics Team to speak at a SmartWay webinar to share our sustainability journey with more than 100 companies from a range of industries.\n\nAs we build on this progress and drive toward a more sustainable and efficient logistics network, our goals include:\n\n- Increasing supplier participation in freight sustainability programs, including engagement from our ocean and airfreight carriers\n- Incorporating sustainability metrics into sourcing decisions and carrier scorecards\n- Collaborating with carriers on emissions reductions and green technology adoption\n- Promoting the development of innovative strategies, best practice sharing and top-performing carrier recognition\nSupply Chain Compliance\n\nWe place high expectations of excellence and ethical conduct on our suppliers, who are expected to act in a way that is consistent with our principles and values.\n\nOur Supplier Code of Conduct and purchase contract Terms and Conditions set forth expectations for ethically responsible social, business and environmental practices. Our Terms and Conditions clearly state our prohibition against any use of child labor or any other form of forced or involuntary labor, abusive treatment of employees or corrupt business practices in the supplying of goods and services to GM.\n\nOur contracts lay out expectations for lawful compliance within the following areas: data protection and privacy, wages, hours and conditions of employment, subcontractor selection, antidiscrimination and occupational health and safety. GM also expects suppliers to cascade our Supplier Code of Conduct or a code with similar requirements throughout their own value chain.\n\nWe are committed to upholding human rights across our network of suppliers and have several policies in place, including our Human Rights Policy and Conflict Minerals Policy. Our strong focus on supplier sustainability influences sourcing decisions. We strive to utilize ethical and sustainable suppliers who share our values to work together to reach mutual sustainability goals. When sourcing, criteria including meeting conflict mineral reporting requirements, CDP participation and EcoVadis scores are reviewed. High-scoring suppliers may be rewarded with the potential for new or extended contracts.\n\nWhen we become aware of violations or alleged violations of our Supplier Code of Conduct, we respond swiftly and appropriately, up to and including the termination of business relationships. GM conducts annual self-verification surveys to validate adherence to the Code and contractual obligations. Material noncompliance disclosed in surveys or otherwise identified is addressed directly with suppliers. In 2021, survey responses were collected from 3,900 suppliers spanning production, logistics, customer care and after sales support.\n\nSupplier responses to the survey are reviewed and, if required, are escalated to remediate risk and noncompliance.\n\nGM requires our Tier I suppliers that provide production parts for vehicles across the globe to mandate that their direct suppliers meet all GM\u2019s quality standards. The foundation of this process is our Built in Quality Supplier (BIQS), consisting of IATF 16949 certification and Quality Performance Metrics. This foundation allows them to cascade quality standards through the tiers of our supply base. We aim for all GM Tier I suppliers to achieve BIQS Level 5, the highest level possible. BIQS compliance also encourages these Tier I suppliers to uphold the same quality standards within their own supply bases, since issues here can ultimately affect their quality performance. To support monitoring, suppliers\u2019 IATF 16949 certification status is part of our Sourceability Report, which is a compilation of metrics used to make informed sourcing decisions and support supplier engagement. Suppliers found not conforming to the IATF standard are required to implement corrective actions. After implementation, the certification body reaudits the supplier to ensure conformance.\n\n3,900 suppliers participated in supplier compliance surveys in 2021.\nSupply Chain Disruption\n\nSupply chain visibility is key to identifying and mitigating sustainability risk and impacts and achieving proactive avoidance.\n\nWe utilize an industry-leading, in-house customized supply chain visibility tool that integrates GM plants, Tier I suppliers, reported Tier II suppliers and logistics nodes. This tool gives our organization the capability to map geographic locations and relationships across the global GM supply chain. The tool also incorporates 24/7 monitoring and global incident mapping of supply chain disruptions and potential human rights issues including those affecting members of our supply chain worldwide.\n\nThrough our monitoring process, GM can identify suppliers potentially involved in human rights events. If identified, GM\u2019s Supply Chain Risk Management Team reacts swiftly to notify the appropriate GM global supply chain crisis response teams. These crisis teams are then able to work cross-functionally with Tier I suppliers and GM\u2019s functional purchasing, logistics and engineering teams to respond. This collaboration enables GM to mitigate any human rights or sustainability risks potentially identified.\n\nHow We Monitor & Manage Supply Chain Risks\n\n- Senior leadership review at least four times per year\n- Cross-functional meetings\n- Board Risk & Cybersecurity Committee\n- Risk Advisory Council\n- Quarterly risk dashboard updates\n- Annual CEO business unit reviews\n- Annual global risk assessment\n- Senior Leadership Team interviews\n\nSupply Chain Monitoring\n\n- Use innovative tools and real-time data analysis to monitor catastrophic events (e.g., earthquake, hurricane) and isolated disruptions (e.g., factory fire, labor strike).\n- Report all potential impacts to regional command center.\n- Receive information on suppliers and supply chain tiers through third-party services.\n- Factor risk scores into sourcing process.\n- Develop mitigation plan for high-risk areas.\nResponsible Sourcing of Raw Materials\n\nMany of the advanced technologies in our portfolio may use minerals and materials that are potentially mined in conflict-affected and high-risk areas.\n\nTo identify and mitigate human rights risk in the sourcing of these raw materials, our due diligence practices undertaken in connection with our Responsible Materials Program and our Conflict Mineral Program are aligned with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas.\n\nWe enjoy strong management support for conflict mineral supply chain due diligence. A compliance committee comprised of cross-functional GM leaders and an executive steering committee provide leadership and direction for the program.\n\nThird-party cobalt and mica mining activities in certain regions of the world have been associated with potential human rights violations. To help mitigate this risk, we annually request all Tier I direct vehicle component suppliers with cobalt product content to complete the Cobalt Reporting Template, the Mica Reporting Template (MRT) and the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT) to help GM map the supply chain for components containing these minerals.\n\nSimilarly, we annually utilize the CMRT to survey 100% of Tier I suppliers with products containing tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold (3TG) to gain visibility of the smelters or refiners (SORs) of these minerals in our supply chain. In 2021, 2,602 supplier locations were considered in-scope for GM\u2019s Conflict Minerals Program, and we received responses from 94% of these suppliers.\n\nAfter SORs are identified, they are validated to determine whether they have passed the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP). This process, administered through the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), employs a risk-based approach to validate SORs\u2019 processes in place for responsible mineral procurement. Those SORs that have passed this assessment are considered conformant to the RMAP.\n\nSupporting Supplier Communities\n\nGM is committed to supporting communities in which we source minerals. For example, we recently became members of the Pact Youth Apprenticeship Program in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Pact implements various programs in the Lualaba province with the aim of reducing child labor in mining. These activities include community sensitization, positive parenting training, coordination of community stakeholders and strengthening of civil society organizations.\n\nSince 2017, Pact has assisted youth in the Kolwezi area to thrive in alternative livelihoods to mining by equipping them with vocational and business skills. Pact analyzes the feasibility and profitability of trades within a specific community through a market study. Then, Pact identifies mentors from the selected trades and chooses them based on their good character, solid professional experience, proof of legal establishment and a workshop in the target community. Finally, adolescent miners, from 15 to 17 years old, are selected to undergo a six-month intensive apprenticeship in a trade.\nIt is our aim to work with suppliers through the tiers of our supply chain to identify nonconformance to our policies and code of conduct and remedy nonconformance. If we cannot find an avenue to mitigate the risk, we reevaluate the business relationship.\n\nWe are an active participant within the RMI and corresponding RMI working subgroups. The Smelter Engagement Team is one of these subgroups that enables us to have direct SOR engagement. We have found that coordinated outreach to nonconformant SORs can be effective at encouraging RMAP participation.\n\nLikewise, GM has participated in RMI-sponsored SOR RMAP pre-audit visits, with the most recent visit being in 2019 with an Indian gold refiner.\n\nIf SORs have not been validated as conformant to the RMAP, we encourage them to participate in this third-party assessment. GM sent communications to 10 3TG SORs during the 2021 calendar year. Due to COVID-19 concerns and restrictions, GM did not conduct on-site SOR visits in 2020 or 2021.\n\nThe extraction of cobalt, a component of lithium-ion batteries, raises industrywide concerns around the use of child labor. Through efforts and membership in RMI, we are working to mitigate human rights risk in the cobalt supply chain by:\n\n- Identifying and assisting with the disposition of cobalt refiners to determine if these companies meet RMI\u2019s industry specification for an eligible cobalt refiner.\n- Performing outreach to cobalt refiners that are not conforming to the RMI industry standards to encourage them to go through the RMAP for cobalt.\n- Functioning as a single point of contact on behalf of RMI for several cobalt refiners, assisting them in their pursuit to join the RMAP.\n\nWe are working collaboratively within RMI\u2019s mica subgroup to proactively develop processes to reduce human rights risk in the mica supply chain. The RMI subgroup is working with the Responsible Mica Initiative in the following areas:\n\n- Identifying processors of mica in the supply chain using a company identification questionnaire.\n- Creating a joint due diligence standard for these processors.\n- Dispositioning processors of mica using RMI methods and adding them to the RMI smelter/refiner database.\n\nThese efforts will allow us to expand our due diligence scope to mica. In 2021, we requested MRTs from all suppliers with mica content in their products. Doing so will allow GM to gain visibility of mica processors in our supply chain to identify risk and conduct due diligence to reduce human rights and environmental harm in the mica supply chain.\n\nWe work with our suppliers regularly to provide education and awareness, including training, webinars and supplier bulletins. We are active in the AIAG Responsible Materials Work Group, which works on common automotive industry solutions with other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and suppliers regarding conflict minerals and high-risk materials. In 2021, we joined the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance, a third-party certification of industrial mine sites for mined materials, and RCS Global Better Mining Initiative for small and artisanal mines.\nSupporting Diverse Suppliers\n\nGM continues to build upon our legacy of leadership by helping diverse suppliers advance.\n\nFor over a decade, GM utilized our annual Supplier Connections event to strengthen existing relationships, enhance our business acumen and identify new sourcing opportunities, which has attracted thousands of attendees. COVID-19 has challenged us and our diverse business communities, driving us to stay connected virtually in 2021.

The action plan is realized through five components:\n\n1. **Strengthened Commitment**\n   - Increased Diverse Media Spend\u2014In 2021, General Motors achieved our stated goal of investing 8% in Total Diverse Owned and Targeted media, and we expect to meet our goal of investing 10% in Total Diverse Owned and Targeted media in 2022.\n\n2. **Deeper Engagements**\n   - Diverse-Owned Media Summit\u2014GM hosted our first Diverse-Owned Media Summit in May 2021, with over 200 diverse media owners in attendance to demonstrate our commitment to build relationships with diverse-owned media providers through communication and collaboration. We will host our 2nd Annual Summit in May 2022.\n   - We encouraged attendees at the Summit to submit an overview of their business for GM\u2019s consideration for deeper engagements beyond the summit.\n\n3. **Sustainable Growth**\n   - Diverse Marketing Incubator Fund\u2014GM plans to allocate $50 million over 10 years to support and scale diverse marketing companies. This investment is expected to support sustainable growth and is incremental to GM\u2019s media spend.\n\n4. **Increased Flexibility**\n   - Revisited Payment Terms\u2014General Motors was an early adopter to shorten payment terms for its diverse-owned marketing companies by modifying our standard payment terms and reducing payment timing from 60 days to 30 days to help give diverse suppliers greater flexibility. This underscores GM\u2019s priority, in collaboration with diverse media, to create a win-win for diverse media companies and GM.\n\n5. **Expanded Opportunities**\n   - Prospective Partnering Analysis\u2014GM expects its media buying agencies to follow a multifactor analysis for selection of diverse media. The analysis requires new criteria for assessing capabilities, reach and analytics and is expected to drive more opportunity for diverse media.\n\n---\n\n**Achieved our goal of 8% in Total Diverse Owned and Targeted media in 2021**\n\n**Expect to meet our goal of 10% in 2022**\nBuilding More Inclusive Communities\n\nIN THIS SECTION\n\nAn Inclusive Social Impact Strategy 99\nFunding to Support an Equitable Transition 100\nClimate Equity Fund: Year 1 Highlights 101\nInvesting in Our Hometown 101\nCommunity Relations 102\n\nOur Strengths\n\n- Contributing our time and talents to benefit underserved communities\n- Building positive relationships in communities that strengthen our social license to operate\n- Using the power of our voice to advocate internally and externally, for a future with equity and inclusion for all\n- Ensuring an equitable transition to an all-electric future\n\nOur Opportunities\n\n- Continuing to work to make sure that everyone in our communities has an equitable chance to succeed\n- Measuring social impact in a meaningful and statistically rigorous way\n- Supporting communities that are disproportionately affected by climate change through our Climate Equity Fund and other initiatives\nAn Inclusive Social Impact Strategy\n\nOur social impact strategy focuses on philanthropic investments that create inclusive and sustainable solutions to common social issues.\n\nWe prioritize programs that create equitable opportunities for minority populations.

Shifts of this magnitude have a history of leaving communities behind. As we accelerate that future, we must listen, learn and apply an equity lens to our actions. We understand that climate change does not impact every community equally, and that sustainable technology alone is not enough for everyone to benefit from an all-electric future.\n\nIn its first year, the Climate Equity Fund disbursed grants to 19 nonprofit organizations. One recipient was a novel EV project, the St. Louis Vehicle Electrification Rides for Seniors (SiLVERS) program sponsored by Forth Mobility. SiLVERS provides EVs to two community centers that offer nonemergency rides to elders and distribute food to homebound seniors in North and South St. Louis. The program supports historically underserved communities with electric technologies to offset tailpipe emissions from fossil fuel-powered trips.\n\nOur understanding of community challenges associated with climate change has led to the establishment of a $50M Climate Equity Fund that provides philanthropic support to community-based organizations. We have doubled our investment since an initial $25 million in 2021.\n\nGrants are focused toward furthering the four areas of GM\u2019s Climate Action Framework for an Equitable Transition:\n\n- future of work\n- electric vehicle (EV) access\n- EV infrastructure equity\n- climate equity\n\nEngaging with Stakeholders\n\nOur everybody in approach to an all-electric future extends to engaging with stakeholders on key topics. In 2021, Ceres convened a diverse group of stakeholders to provide recommendations to GM to help inform our role in an equitable transition to clean mobility within the United States. The discussion centered around three themes:\n\n- Defining equitable clean mobility, which may differ among communities and their historic context;\n- Economywide obstacles such as affordability of vehicles and access to charging infrastructure; and\n- Viable solutions in which GM can play a role such as charging and car share opportunities.\n\nIn addition, other transition considerations were discussed, such as the impact on today\u2019s workers and the need to prepare the next generation of workers for an EV future.\nInvesting in Our Hometown\n\nAnother key focus of our corporate giving strategy is the city of Detroit, home to GM\u2019s global headquarters.\n\nIn 2021, we announced a $50 million investment in Detroit-based nonprofit programs that expand access to education and employment opportunities and strengthen city neighborhoods. We\u2019ve aligned these specific areas of focus to address the needs of Detroit and its residents. Last year, we funded 53 projects that will impact 173,490 individuals. Portfolio highlights include:\n\n- 1.25 million pounds of fresh and shelf-stable food provided to families.\n- 129 individuals to enroll in paid training, internship and full-time employment opportunities.\n- $150,000 in grants awarded to 10 local small businesses.\n\nClimate Equity Fund: Year 1 Highlights\n\n- 605 individuals better qualified for clean energy jobs\n- 19 nonprofits funded\n- 94,287 individuals impacted\n- 11,600 students, educators and mentors to implement sustainability projects\n- 82,367 individuals to be impacted by climate change mitigation programs\n\nProgram Highlights\n\nThe Heat, Health and Equity Initiative (HHEI) addresses the disparate effects of extreme heat, one of the deadliest impacts of climate change, on low-income communities and communities of color throughout Northern Manhattan. The HHEI works to ensure the community is aware of the impact of extreme heat, and how to access benefits and programs, while also working to advance community-driven policy recommendations to improve federal and state programs.\n\nValley CAN estimates only 20% of the needed zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) maintenance technicians receive training. Valley CAN partnered with community college automotive programs and the California New Car Dealers Association and their members to expand a successful ZEV maintenance pilot, creating a job pipeline for graduates and preparing to implement ZEV maintenance training curriculum statewide.\n\nA grant from GM will help RMI identify EV \u201ccharging deserts\u201d in low-income communities across major North American cities. With this support, it will also create a large government, industry and community stakeholder effort to streamline residential and public EV charging infrastructure permitting, creating more opportunities to bring EVs to low-income neighborhoods.\n\n1 General Motors awards grants for a one-year term. Therefore, grants awarded throughout 2021 may still be in progress in 2022, and some impact numbers may be estimates.\nCommunity Relations\n\nGM has 118 facilities in the United States, located in 27 states. In many of the communities where we live and work, we are a major employer and significant contributor to the local tax base.\n\nIn turn, these communities are a source of local talent and resources that enable our operation. This symbiotic relationship is part of our business strategy, and we are committed to ensuring these relationships are built on trust and accountability. That means positive and sustainable engagement with key individuals, groups and organizations in each community where we live and work. As our industry and world transform, we aim to strengthen and fortify these grassroots relationships in order to build resiliency in both our business and our communities.\n\nIn 2021, GM leaders at both the local and corporate level prioritized local community engagement and dialogue that centered on collaboration, problem solving and sharing of best practices. This communication included the launch of 10 unique external newsletters in 25 different communities to share quarterly local and corporate news.\n\nGM has longstanding positive relationships with local public health departments. The pandemic provided an opportunity to strengthen our collaboration through vaccination, contact tracing and other activities. As vaccines became available early in the year, GM developed an internal campaign to promote the benefits of vaccination. In GM communities where vaccination rates were lower than the state average, we partnered with local chambers of commerce to share our voice as a community business leader and our own approach to vaccination efforts. We also helped amplify this message through TV and radio interviews across multiple states and penned an op-ed from our chief medical officer and workplace safety lead, titled \u201cWorking Together for a Safe Return to Work,\u201d that we shared with local publications.\n\nIt\u2019s particularly important for us to ensure local communities understand GM\u2019s business transformation. Following our Investor Event in October, our executive vice president of manufacturing and sustainability hosted community webinars with key stakeholders to share more about GM\u2019s growth strategy and electrification journey. He underscored that manufacturing is a competitive advantage for GM and outlined how we intend to bring our people and our communities along on our journey, and how we can support that journey by advocating for EV charging infrastructure and helping to build the workforce of the future.\n2021 GM Giving At-a-Glance\n\n**Total 1.7M individuals**\n\n**74 nonprofits engaged**\n\n**76,230 total individuals**\n\n**12 BIPOC-owned small businesses received a grant and technical assistance**\n\n**11,827 free rides to alleviate transportation barriers**\n\n**2,000 women of color to receive entrepreneurship education**\n\n**GM COMMUNITY IMPACT GRANTS DISBURSED**\n\n**$3M in grants**\n\n**148 nonprofits**\n\n**112,000 estimated people impacted**\n\n**GM CARES**\n\n**Our employee volunteer force**\n\nTime valued at **$3M for 364 nonprofits**\n\n**15,284 employee volunteers**\n\n**95,648 volunteer hours**\n\n**17 states and 9 countries**\n\n**Employee Participation**\n\n| Year | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| 12,167 | 15,445 | 17,648 | 18,880 | 15,190 | 15,284 |\n\n**FUNDING BY UNDERREPRESENTED POPULATION**\n\n- **39% Black/African American**\n- **19% Hispanic/Latino**\n- **8% Other underrepresented populations**\n\n**STEM IMPACT**\n\n- **76,230 total individuals**\n- **12 BIPOC-owned small businesses received a grant and technical assistance**\n- **11,827 free rides to alleviate transportation barriers**\n- **2,000 women of color to receive entrepreneurship education**\n\n**GM COMMUNITY IMPACT GRANTS DISBURSED**\n\n- **$3M in grants**\n- **148 nonprofits**\n- **112,000 estimated people impacted**\n\n**GM CARES**\n\n- **Our employee volunteer force**\n  - Time valued at **$3M for 364 nonprofits**\n  - **15,284 employee volunteers**\n  - **95,648 volunteer hours**\n  - **17 states and 9 countries**\n\n**Employee Participation**\n\n| Year | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| 12,167 | 15,445 | 17,648 | 18,880 | 15,190 | 15,284 |\n\n**VEHICLE & ROAD SAFETY IMPACT**\n\n- **36,000 individuals committed to the Safe Driving Pledge**\n- **153 high schools provided road safety programming**\n- **483,000 individuals to receive education on seat belt use**\n\n**FUNDING BY UNDERREPRESENTED POPULATION**\n\n- **39% Black/African American**\n- **19% Hispanic/Latino**\n- **8% Other underrepresented populations**\n\n**Introduction**\n\n- **Reducing Emissions**\n- **Design for Environment**\n- **Technology**\n- **Customers**\n- **Safety**\n- **Diverse Workforce**\n- **Human Rights**\n- **Supply Chain**\n- **Governance**\n\n---\n\n1 Subject to change annually based on investment portfolio priorities.\nEnsuring Responsible Governance\n\nOur Strengths\n\n- Using our Purpose, Vision, Values and Core Behaviors as a guide for how we conduct ourselves in all areas of business\n- Leading our industry regarding ethical business practices as one of Ethisphere\u2019s World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies\u00ae\n- Maintaining Board committees that enhance the Board\u2019s oversight of corporate social responsibility and sustainability\n\nOur Opportunities\n\n- Engaging with and incorporating the insights of institutional shareholders\n- Addressing emerging cybersecurity risks related to business and customer security and privacy\n- Ensuring environmental compliance at facilities across the world with varying requirements and resource constraints\n- Holding all employees and third parties accountable to our Code of Conduct and appropriately investigating concerns raised\nCorporate Governance\n\nGM is governed by its Board of Directors that meets throughout the year.\n\nThe Board is elected by GM\u2019s shareholders to oversee and provide guidance on GM\u2019s business and affairs. It is the ultimate decision-making body of the company, except for those matters specifically reserved to shareholders. Among other things, the Board oversees company strategy and execution of the strategic plan. In addition, it oversees management\u2019s proper safeguarding of the assets of the company, maintenance of appropriate financial and other internal controls, compliance with applicable laws and regulations and proper governance. The Board is committed to sound corporate governance policies and practices that are designed and routinely assessed to enable GM to operate its business responsibly, sustain our success and build long-term shareholder value. The Board also works with management to integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles into the company\u2019s business strategy. This includes agenda items and discussions related to ESG topics at Board and committee meetings.\n\nLeadership Structure\n\nCurrently, the Board is led by our Chair and CEO, Mary Barra, whose role as Board Chair is complemented by that of our Independent Lead Director, Patricia Russo. The Board is comprised of 13 members, all but one of whom\u2014Ms. Barra\u2014are independent, as defined by the Board\u2019s Corporate Governance Guidelines, which reflect the independence standards of the New York Stock Exchange and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe Board has the flexibility to decide when the positions of Board Chair and CEO should be combined or separated and whether a GM executive or an independent director should be Board Chair. This allows the Board to choose the leadership structure that it believes will best serve the interests of our shareholders at any particular time. At this time, the Board continues to believe that Ms. Barra\u2019s in-depth knowledge of GM\u2019s business and vision for the future bring focused leadership to the Board. Therefore, combining the role of Chair and CEO and electing a strong Independent Lead Director results in the optimal Board leadership structure for GM at this time.\n\nGovernance Best Practices and Shareholder Protections\n\nThe Board has adopted governance structures and policies that it believes promote Board independence and protect the interests of shareholders. These structures and policies include, among others:\n\n- Independence of 12 out of 13 directors.\n- Strong Independent Lead Director empowered with clearly delineated duties.\n- Annual election of all directors.\n- Majority voting with director resignation policy in uncontested elections.\n- Annual review of the Board\u2019s leadership structure by the independent directors.\n- Proxy access and shareholder right to call special meetings.\n- No poison pill or dual-class shares.\nBoard Diversity\n\nGM\u2019s Board is composed of directors who bring diverse viewpoints and possess a variety of skills, professional experience and backgrounds, including with respect to ESG. 54% of our directors are women, and 31% of our directors identify themselves as racially/ethnically diverse. In addition, 67% of Board committees are chaired by women. Read more about the Board in our 2022 Proxy Statement.\n\n2021 Board Composition\n\n- **Gender**: 6 Male, 7 Female\n- **Race and Ethnicity**: 9 White, 4 Diverse Race or Ethnicity\n- **6 Years Average Tenure**: 6 0-5 years, 4 >5-10 years, 3 >10 years\n- **63 Years Average Age**: 3 50s, 9 60s, 1 70s\n- **67% of committees chaired by women (4 out of 6)**\n- **63 average age of directors Range: 52\u201371**\n- **4 new directors over past three years**\n\nCommittee Structure and ESG Governance\n\nThe Board has six standing committees: Audit; Executive; Executive Compensation; Finance; Governance and Corporate Responsibility; and Risk and Cybersecurity. Other than the Executive Committee, all standing committees of the Board consist entirely of independent directors.\n\nThrough the Board as a whole and each of its committees, the Board is committed to overseeing the company\u2019s integration of ESG principles throughout GM\u2019s business and managing the related risks and opportunities. The key responsibilities, recent activities and focus areas of each committee can be found in our 2022 Proxy Statement.\n\nEach committee has a written charter setting forth its purpose, authority and duties. Overall, the committees enhance the Board\u2019s oversight of areas that are critical to GM\u2019s corporate responsibility and sustainability efforts, including: transparent and reliable financial reporting; risk identification and mitigation (including climate change and other ESG issues); ethics and compliance; product and workplace safety; supply chain and human rights; pay-for-performance; data security; diversity, equity and inclusion; Board and management succession planning; consideration of shareholder proposals; and political and lobbying priorities and expenditures.\nBoard Committees and ESG\n\nEach year, in connection with the review of its committee charters, the Board updates the committees\u2019 oversight responsibilities as necessary. In 2021, the Board updated each charter to delegate specific ESG responsibilities to each committee. Below is a summary of these charter updates along with other highlights of the committees\u2019 ESG-related responsibilities and practices:\n\n**Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee**\n- Responsible for ESG initiatives, strategies and policies that have a material impact on the company.\n- Tracks an ESG scorecard and conducts annual reviews of ESG reporting standards, lobbying activities, corporate philanthropy and human rights (including responsible sourcing practices and policies).\n- Responsible for the Board\u2019s shareholder engagement program.\n- Starting in 2022, reviews and approves the Sustainability Report.\n\n**Audit Committee**\n- Beginning in 2021, reviews the disclosure process and control procedures over ESG disclosures.\n- Starting in 2022, reviews and approves the Sustainability Report.\n- Oversees the Internal Audit Function, General Motors Audit Services (GMAS), which provides independent, objective assurance on the effectiveness of risk management, internal controls and governance processes within GM. GMAS\u2019 annual audit plan includes coverage of controls around ESG disclosures as well as workplace and vehicle safety, ethics and compliance, environmental and cyber risks.\n\n**Executive Compensation Committee**\n- Starting in 2022, will (i) make an annual determination as to whether the company\u2019s ESG and sustainability goals and milestones are effectively integrated into the compensation programs; (ii) review compensation plans for executives to confirm the alignment related to GM\u2019s sustainability risks and opportunities; and (iii) with respect to the annual shareholder say-on-pay vote, consider shareholder feedback relative to the alignment of GM\u2019s sustainability goals.\n\n**Finance Committee**\n- Reviews changes to our shareholder composition, including the impact of ESG-oriented investors.\n\n**Risk and Cybersecurity Committee**\n- Reviews GM\u2019s strategic, operational and cybersecurity risks, including workplace safety, vehicle cybersecurity safety, climate change and privacy risk.\n- Considers climate change as part of its key strategic and operational risk management framework.\nShareholder Engagement\n\nMembers of the Board and senior management regularly engage with institutional shareholders. These engagements help the Board and management gain feedback on a variety of topics, including strategic and financial performance; operations; products; executive compensation; and Board composition and leadership structure; as well as on important environmental and social issues. The constructive insights, experiences and ideas exchanged during these engagements have helped the Board evaluate and assess key initiatives during GM\u2019s ongoing transition to an all-electric future.\n\nGM also has a history of engaging with shareholders who submit proposals for inclusion in our proxy statement for consideration at our annual meeting. In the past, these constructive engagements have led to shareholders withdrawing their proposals following discussion and action on the part of GM. Learn more about the Board\u2019s engagement with shareholders and other stakeholders in our 2022 Proxy Statement.\n\nBoard Oversight of Risk Management\n\nThe Board discharges its risk oversight responsibilities, in part, through delegation to its committees. The company\u2019s risk governance is facilitated through a top-down and bottom-up communication structure, with the tone established at the top by Ms. Barra, the Board Chair and CEO, who also serves as Chief Risk Officer, and other members of management, namely the Senior Leadership Team. The Senior Leadership Team also utilizes our Risk Advisory Council, an executive-level body with delegates from each business unit, to discuss and monitor the most significant enterprise and emerging risks in a cross-functional setting. They are tasked with championing risk management practices and integrating them into their functional or regional business units.\n\nCorporate Political Contributions and Lobbying Expenditures\n\nThe Board has an active role in overseeing GM\u2019s participation in the political process and believes it should have a role in helping to shape public policy and address legislation that impacts the company, our industry and our shareholders and other stakeholders. GM has supported and will continue to support public policies that drive the achievement of our long-term, sustainable growth. The following are highlights of the Board\u2019s role:\n\n- To guide activities, the Board has adopted a U.S. Corporate Political Contributions and Expenditures Policy (Political Contributions Policy).\n- The Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee oversees the Political Contributions Policy and annually reviews the company\u2019s engagement in the public policy process.\n- The Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee also annually reviews all corporate political contributions, GM Political Action Committee contributions (which are funded entirely by voluntary employee contributions) and the process by which they are made. The committee receives multiple updates each year regarding the company\u2019s direct and indirect lobbying activities and expenditures.\n- The Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee annually conducts a benchmarking exercise to confirm its political contribution and lobbying expenditure disclosures align with those of our peers and discusses emerging shareholder expectations.\n\nThe Board also receives a monthly report on the most pressing public policy issues. It uses this report to continuously assess which issues are important to the company\u2019s long-term interests and which organizations the company is working with to advance those interests.\n\nLearn more about GM Lobbying guidelines in our Public Policy Policy Supplement.\nCybersecurity & Privacy\n\nTransformative innovations\u2014self-driving vehicles, combined with electrification and connectivity\u2014are changing the nature of transportation and our relationships to the vehicles that move us.\n\nAs the automotive industry continues to mitigate risks in the physical world, such as crashes, emissions and congestion, new risks are emerging in the virtual world, including cybersecurity and privacy risks. Cybersecurity and data protection are critical to the digital transformation of the auto industry.\n\nCybersecurity Risks\n\nSoftware and connected services are key to GM\u2019s vision of zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, and with the increasing connectivity of GM vehicles, cybersecurity risks continue to evolve. Already, GM offers OnStar and connected services to more than 22 million connected vehicles globally through subscription-based and complimentary services. Safely and securely delivering these services has been possible due to a strong cybersecurity focus and priority throughout the company. GM\u2019s organizational focus and oversight of cybersecurity is well-developed. This structure includes a dedicated Risk and Cybersecurity Committee of the Board, cybersecurity leadership tied directly to the CEO and Senior Leadership Team and a vice president of global cybersecurity who serves as a single-point senior executive. This vice president leads a dedicated organization that focuses on protecting against unauthorized access to vehicle safety systems and customer data.\n\nLeveraging well-established risk frameworks and standards, GM is focused on cybersecurity risk throughout the entire company, including information technology and intellectual property protection, vehicle and connected services, manufacturing safety and operations, supply chain and third-party security, merger and acquisition risks and the secure integration of all new business models. Cybersecurity remains a core focus and a high priority at GM in the development of advanced driving features, semi and autonomous systems, in-market enhancements, connected services and many other software-defined services. Hardware and software protective measures are employed and a key focus of our Product Cybersecurity organization.\n\nPrivacy Protection\n\nGM relies upon information technology systems and networked products, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, activities and products. Additionally, GM collects and stores sensitive data, including personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in data centers and across information technology networks. Robust privacy policies and processes are critical to protecting GM\u2019s employees and customers, and our business.\n\nGM\u2019s Privacy Center publishes a Global Privacy Policy that covers all GM operations. We also have a Third-Party Information Security Requirements Exhibit and Privacy Exhibit with specific additional privacy obligations that are required for all contracts involving personal information (PI). Our contracts lay out requirements for compliance with data protection and privacy laws and regulations, and for managing PI in a manner that reinforces customer and employee trust and confidence in GM and our products and services. We keep these documents updated to address changes in laws and regulations, changes in our business and products, and changes in consumer expectations. In addition, the Board has approved the adoption of Global Privacy Principles, and GM continues to be committed to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation\u2019s Consumer Privacy Protection Principles.\n\nPrivacy Program\n\nThe Privacy Center has a privacy program framework that focuses on policies, procedures, tools, guidance and training. This framework also includes a Privacy-by-Design program that requires all data-dependent initiatives to receive a privacy-focused consultation through their life cycle. The Privacy Center resides within our legal staff, and additional non-legal resources\nare leveraged on a functional, regional and product/program basis to instill best practices in a consistent manner across the global enterprise. In certain cases, external reviewers have been engaged to ensure use of industry best practices.\n\nThe goal of our collaborative privacy practice is to ensure that the collection, use and sharing of employee and customer PI is secure and compliant, and that it reinforces employee and customer trust and confidence. Our greatest resources in protecting PI are our employees and processes. Privacy compliance is part of GM\u2019s annual Corporate Required Training (CRT), which emphasizes the importance of privacy to our business and the high priority the company places on employee and consumer privacy. In addition to GM\u2019s annual training, the Privacy Center conducts awareness training on emerging privacy laws and regulations with key areas of our business.\n\nPrivacy Practices\n\nOur Information Security program is aligned to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standards and includes elements to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. We have a robust Information Lifecycle Management (ILM) Policy and record retention schedule that applies globally to all GM employees and other individuals or entities (e.g., contract workers, purchased services, etc.) that create or manage GM records. The ILM Policy requires that we properly retain only those records needed to meet business, fiscal and legal requirements. GM requires an online Privacy Impact Assessment to be completed, reviewed and approved by a Privacy Center member prior to the implementation of any new product, service or process, or any change to the foregoing, involving the use of PI. Additionally, Information Security Risk Management creates a PI risk score for systems containing PI. Systems with high risk are required to have additional information technology controls. We have instituted a cross-functional data export review process that evaluates the privacy, security and business risks of proposed data exports outside GM. Unless a proposed export is approved by the cross-functional team, it does not leave GM.\n\nIncidents\n\nGM has a robust process for employees to report an incident involving possible wrongdoing, a violation of GM\u2019s Code of Conduct\u2014Winning with Integrity, an IT or other cybersecurity event, PI incident or other concerns. This includes reporting through our toll-free GM Awareline hotline and a robust process for reviewing and investigating all alleged incidents. An employee who violates our Privacy Policy or Code of Conduct may be subject to discipline, including warnings, suspension with or without pay and/or termination of employment. GM also has a dedicated cyber intelligence team that continuously monitors publicly available information for cyber incidents or data spills that may impact GM or our suppliers.\n\nCustomer Privacy\n\nGM\u2019s privacy statements are publicly disclosed on consumer-facing websites such as our corporate, vehicle brand and OnStar sites. We utilize an opt-in approach for the collection, use and sharing of consumer PI where legally required or appropriate, based on the nature of the data collected and its intended use. We also offer customers opt-out options where appropriate. GM complies with all privacy regulations, such as General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act. We honor data subject requests under these regulations, including requests to access, make corrections to and delete data. In addition, we do not allow the use of customer PI for secondary usage if it is not disclosed in the Privacy Statement or otherwise consented to by the customer. In 2021, we did not have any material customer privacy complaints.\nEnvironmental Management & Compliance\n\nGM facilities around the world vary in function, geography, size and surrounding natural environments, which gives rise to varying concerns such as resource scarcity and different levels of environmental compliance requirements.\n\nAlthough GM-owned and -operated facilities have their own operating plans depending on their location, all function under a common Global Environmental Policy, which provides an effective foundation for environmental stewardship.\n\nGM has a robust process to enhance the integration of environmental sustainability practices into daily business decisions and to:\n\n- Comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations globally.\n- Monitor our performance according to GM\u2019s own Environmental Performance Criteria (EPCs), which are universal corporate performance requirements designed to protect human health and the environment in accordance with the GM Global Environmental Policy.\n- Conform to key sustainability performance indicators and environmental performance metrics.\n\nEach GM manufacturing site has one or more environmental leaders, who are supported by a GM regional environmental leader and a team of subject matter experts in regional central offices. We also have an annual business planning process, known as Business Plan Deployment (BPD), to strengthen the management of environmental performance. This process links our Global Manufacturing salaried employees and their annual compensation to GM Sustainability Commitments. Performance on BPD metrics and goals is monitored monthly at all GM manufacturing sites. Action plans are developed as needed to ensure we keep performance on track.\n\nEnvironmental Compliance\n\nAs a responsible corporate citizen, GM\u2019s Global Environmental Policy and Guiding Environmental Commitments provide guidelines to help reduce the impact of our activities on the environment.\n\nOur global guidelines play a significant role in our overall environmental compliance, ensuring that local plant policies:\n\n- Are appropriate to the nature, scale and environmental impacts of each plant\u2019s activities, products or services.\n- Reinforce a commitment to comply with applicable laws and regulations and with other relevant environmental requirements.\n- Include a commitment to continuous improvement and pollution prevention.\n- Provide the framework for setting and reviewing environmental goals and targets.\n- Are documented, implemented, maintained and communicated to all employees.\n\nStatutory, regulatory and permit programs administered by various governmental agencies in different jurisdictions impose numerous environmental requirements on our facilities and products. Compliance with applicable environmental requirements is an organizational imperative. Compliance issues occasionally arise, and each allegation of noncompliance is treated seriously by GM. In 2021, GM received 15 Notices of Violation, 12 in the United States and three outside the United States. GM paid one penalty over $10,000 in 2021, at a cost of $10,500.\nEnvironmental Management System (EMS)\n\nAll manufacturing facilities that GM owns and operates, and a majority of our nonmanufacturing sites around the world, have implemented an EMS. GM\u2019s EMS combines elements of ISO 14001 and management system elements that are unique to our operations.\n\nFrom 2019 through 2022, GM developed and implemented an aligned, global, third-party certified ISO 14001 enterprise program. This integration ensures we achieve our environmental commitments as a normal part of our business activities.\n\nGM continues to expand our EMS programs into other company entities when and where there is a recognized identified benefit.\n\nEnvironmental Performance\n\nImplementation of our Guiding Environmental Commitments is facilitated by GM EPCs that apply to our global facilities and major technology centers. The EPCs are internal performance requirements for the management of environmental matters at our facilities. In many cases, they supplement applicable legal requirements by setting minimum standards for environmental management and performance practices that may be more stringent than those required by law. As a result, we work to ensure that a base level of environmental performance is achieved, regardless of where a facility is located or whether a particular jurisdiction has an environmental regulatory program in place.\n\nIn 2020, we expanded our tracking of environmental compliance and sustainability performance in manufacturing operations by leveraging the Manufacturing Excellence Indexes (MEI) system. Created by Manufacturing, MEI is an internal GM scoring tool to benchmark GM operations performance against internal facilities. The use of real-time data provides the organization a strategic and common method to measure performance, assess risk and drive continuous improvement.\n\nManaging Substances of Concern Responsibly\n\nGM has established policies, procedures and supplier engagement to monitor banned substances and to ensure global compliance and protect the health of our customers. We receive supplier data monthly that is cross-referenced with known restricted substances lists to ensure compliance with regulations around the world. Our Vehicle Chemical Regulatory Compliance Team evaluates all materials and components/parts to verify that they do not contain substances that are prohibited or restricted through GM internal standards, approval databases, the Global Automotive Declarable Substance List and the International Material Data System.\n\nSt. Catharines Propulsion Plant in Ontario was the winner of the 2021 GM Manufacturing Sustainability Recognition Award for their renewable energy project, Gold Certified Wildlife Habitat and many sustainability initiatives.\nEmployee Environmental Training\n\nOur people are key stakeholders in our environmental stewardship and are critical to our environmental performance. We strive to have the best-trained environmental professionals in the world. Although most environmental training is specific to a facility, country or region, we continually provide strategic training and guidance to our environmental professionals to help them keep pace with evolving environmental issues, changing regulations and best practices. Our training addresses a variety of areas specific to the regulatory requirements for air quality, waste management, water quality and other environment-related topics.\n\nEnvironmental professionals develop training goals through Workday, the company\u2019s human capital management portal, and seek personal and professional development through internal and external conferences, webinars and lunch and learns. In North America, environmental professionals attend focused sessions over a period of a week where speakers, both internal and external to the company, educate on a variety of topics. Outside North America, environmental professionals take a Global Environmental Certification and Training Program focused on GM\u2019s Guiding Environmental Commitments, our internal EPCs and industry best practices.\nWinning with Integrity is one of our Core Behaviors, and the World\u2019s Most Ethical designation is a testament to our ethical leadership as we continue to transform our company and industry. An ethical business starts at the top. Chair and CEO Mary Barra and other members of our Senior Leadership Team regularly issue messages to all employees emphasizing the importance of our Code of Conduct and their expectation that every employee strive to do the right thing, even when it is difficult. The Board is also committed to upholding the highest legal and ethical conduct in fulfilling its responsibilities. All Board members, officers and employees are expected to act ethically at all times and to adhere to the law, our Code of Conduct and any applicable company policies. The Board, in addition to our eligible salaried employees (e.g., everyone other than those on excused leave), also completes GM\u2019s Code of Conduct training. The Board\u2019s Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for GM\u2019s ethics and compliance program, which promotes a culture of high performance with high integrity by advocating and helping implement the principles of GM\u2019s Code of Conduct\u2014Winning with Integrity.\n\nThe Global Ethics and Compliance Center (GECC) is led by the assistant general counsel and chief compliance officer, who reports to the executive vice president of global public policy, general counsel and corporate secretary, and indirectly to the Board\u2019s Audit Committee. The chief compliance officer provides regular updates to the Audit Committee. The chief compliance officer meets with the Audit Committee in private sessions without other members of management present at least once per year. The GECC prevents, detects and helps correct violations of law and corporate policies and helps promote our ethical business culture. The GECC seeks to align GM\u2019s ethics and compliance program with the recognized elements of an effective compliance program and primarily manages GM\u2019s Code of Conduct; Non-Retaliation Policy; conflict of interest disclosure process; investigations; ethics and compliance training and communications; global policy development; compliance assurance; risk-based third-party due diligence; whistleblower line; anti-corruption compliance assurance in GM strategic transactions; and other anti-corruption risk areas.\n\nRegional compliance officers are established in each of GM\u2019s operating regions to help ensure compliance and ethics globally. We also have a network of compliance liaisons, as well as other compliance personnel located throughout GM who provide guidance to employees and answer ethics and compliance questions. Additional global structures and oversight are in place for safety, export compliance, antitrust compliance, data/cybersecurity compliance, records management compliance and other risk areas.\n\nIn 2021, we launched a new Compliance Liaison program to help further localize compliance into business units and to serve as an additional knowledgeable resource for identifying compliance issues. Compliance liaisons are GM team members supporting business units and regions who help detect, prevent and resolve potential compliance issues across the company.\nCode of Conduct\n\nGM\u2019s Code of Conduct\u2014Winning with Integrity\u2014reinforces our commitment to a work environment founded on mutual respect, trust and accountability. It outlines the policies and obligations that guide our business conduct, and includes employee guidance on various reporting mechanisms available to report safety and other concerns (e.g., Speak Up For Safety, Awareline). Our Code of Conduct also emphasizes GM\u2019s Non-Retaliation Policy. It applies across our company, at every level, including supervisors, senior leaders and Board members, and extends to subsidiaries that GM controls. We expect third parties, including suppliers, to act in a manner that is consistent with the principles and values outlined in our GM Supplier Code of Conduct when conducting business with, and on behalf of, GM. We expect GM employees working with our third parties to hold third parties accountable. Our Code of Conduct is available in nine languages (including English); our Supplier Code of Conduct is available in 13 languages (including English); and certain compliance policies are available in multiple languages to ensure they are understood by employees and third parties in all locations where GM does business.\n\nOur Code of Conduct governs how our employees are expected to act: displaying integrity in the workplace, in the marketplace and in their communities when representing GM, and it guides the conduct of our daily business practices worldwide. In 2022, we refreshed the Code of Conduct to add our \u201cBe Inclusive\u201d behavior, a new CEO leadership message and other relevant and timely content.\n\nTo ensure the effectiveness of our Code of Conduct, we regularly conduct independent third-party assessments of GM\u2019s compliance program against the Department of Justice and other applicable laws, regulations and rules. We also regularly conduct compliance risk assessments. Our Code of Conduct publicizes various points of contact for employees with questions or concerns, including local leadership, Human Resources, labor representatives, the GECC, Legal Staff, GM Audit Services and our Awareline.\n\nGM maintains a robust conflict of interest disclosure process that applies to all salaried employees and members of the Board. Employees are required to complete an electronic conflict of interest questionnaire at least once during their employment and keep it updated as their personal circumstances change. Board members who are not employees provide written disclosure of any actual or potential conflicts of interest at least once a year. To ensure compliance awareness continues throughout the year, our GECC team develops compliance and ethics messages on a regular basis, underscoring the importance of these topics.\nReporting Concerns\n\nGM encourages our employees to speak up and provides resources to do so. An internal \u201cReport Concerns\u201d site makes it easy for employees to identify the most effective way to quickly report their concern. In cases where an individual is uncomfortable reporting through other established internal channels, we maintain a global toll-free hotline. The Awareline is operated by an independent third party and allows employees and others to confidentially report concerns of misconduct by the company, our management, supervisors, employees or agents. Reports can be made in more than a dozen languages, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, by phone, web or email. Reports may be made anonymously, where permitted by law.\n\nIn 2021, GM received 4,170 reports to the Awareline, of which 3,048 were classified as allegations, and the remaining reports were suggestions, inquiries or other miscellaneous issues. GM tracks all reports of misconduct\u2014whether made to the Awareline or through some other channel\u2014in a case management system that facilitates efficient investigation, follow-up and compliance trend analysis. The case management system allows GM to follow up with individuals who submit Awareline reports anonymously, while preserving the reporter\u2019s anonymity, to help GM better investigate and remediate anonymous allegations.\n\nAllegations of misconduct are reviewed and prioritized based on a number of factors, including the type of misconduct, the position of the alleged wrongdoer within the company and whether the allegation entails any potential violations of law.\n\nHigh-priority cases receive special scrutiny and review; a cross-functional committee meets monthly to discuss their investigative progress and resolution. There is also a quarterly review process to determine which cases, if any, require reporting to the Board or Audit Committee, as well as processes in case a particular allegation requires more immediate reporting. The chief compliance officer also provides regular updates to the Audit Committee on key GECC priorities and accomplishments and trends in Awareline submissions and investigations.\n\nSpeak Up!, GM\u2019s Non-Retaliation Policy, protects GM employees from retaliation when they raise a concern in good faith. GM\u2019s most recent Ethical Culture Survey, as well as industry benchmarking data, shows that the majority of misconduct reports are made to an employee\u2019s manager. To help our GM managers in such circumstances and to provide additional guidance regarding GM\u2019s Non-Retaliation Policy, the GECC has developed a website that provides helpful compliance tools for managers, including compliance toolkits on various topics, compliance moments to use at meetings, quick reference compliance guides and other materials. GM also makes available a scenario-based \u201cWhat Would You Do?\u201d course for managers. In 2021, the GECC developed and is piloting a post-investigation antiretaliation survey to initiate outreach to known reporters following an investigation to identify and respond to potential retaliation and improve the investigative process. These materials help GM managers create a safe and open reporting environment for their teams.\n\n2021 Types of Allegations Received\n\n| CATEGORY | PROPORTION OF ALLEGATIONS |\n|----------|---------------------------|\n| Accounting, Auditing and Financial Reporting | 0.1% |\n| Fraud relating to accounting procedures, internal controls or auditing matters | 0.1% |\n| Business Integrity | 5.6% |\n| Examples: Fraud, conflicts of interest, corruption | 5.6% |\n| Human Resources, Diversity and Workplace Respect | 66.8% |\n| Examples: Interpersonal conflicts, harassment, discrimination, retaliation | 66.8% |\n| Environment, Health and Safety | 13.3% |\n| Examples: Threats and violence, substance abuse, environmental concerns, workplace safety | 13.3% |\n| Misuse, Misappropriation of Corporate Assets | 14.2% |\n| Examples: Theft, property damage, information or IP loss, computer misuse | 14.2% |\n\nSupplier Due Diligence\n\nGM\u2019s success depends in part on building positive business relationships with reputable and ethical suppliers that meet our business needs. GM maintains a Supplier Code of Conduct that sets forth our expectations for ethical conduct as well as a risk-based due diligence program for our suppliers and business partners. GM\u2019s due diligence activities consider, among other things, safety, reputation, human rights, integrity, business requirements, compliance with laws and GM\u2019s expectations for adherence to Winning with Integrity. We engage in continuous risk assessment, using a variety of tools and cross-functional resources to better understand and mitigate risk. We provide resources to our suppliers through our GM SupplyPower portal and other channels to ensure open communication and to help suppliers understand our expectations and improve their operations. Learn more in Supporting Supplier Responsibility.\nTraining is a critical aspect of reinforcing our ethical culture because it educates our employees on how to apply the standards and principles set forth in our policies in their work activities. Every year, all eligible salaried employees are required to review the Code of Conduct and complete CRT. All CRT courses are available to global employees in eight languages (including English). New or refreshed courses are deployed annually, often with new content, new scenarios and exercises. We use adaptive technology that tailors the courses to an individual\u2019s job responsibilities.\n\nGM\u2019s Compliance Training and Communications Group within the GECC oversees the process of regularly updating the CRT. Once the annual program and policy certification requirements are approved by the CRT governance board, a cross-functional group that includes senior leaders from human resources, the course owners and subject matter experts draft the course objectives and content based on company risk analysis and any new compliance regulations. We follow guiding principles of trust, respect and accountability as we select vendors, determine how many courses to offer, set completion deadlines and make other course-related decisions. For example, we ensure courses are relevant to our employees\u2019 roles, keeping courses concise and setting consistent content standards.\n\nGM achieved a 100% completion rate among eligible salaried employees for both our CRT and Code of Conduct Certification Program.\n\nBeyond distributing our Code of Conduct and requiring annual training on ethics- and compliance-related topics, we use risk-based principles to provide live and/or \u201cvirtual\u201d training to thousands of employees each year. For example, the Compliance Team conducted live training sessions to targeted audiences on topics that included export compliance, antitrust, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, privacy, working with third parties, winning in the marketplace without sacrificing our values and other relevant compliance topics. The GECC also utilizes on-demand microlearning modules so that employees can access refresher training on gifts and entertainment and conflicts of interest processes as needed. Finally, we recognize a companywide Compliance and Ethics Week in which we engage employees through interactive games, leadership messages, compliance toolkits, employee recognitions and other measures to promote our Winning with Integrity behavior. By keeping ethical behaviors top of mind for all GM employees throughout the year, we continue to win with integrity in our dealings with suppliers, governments and other third parties.\n\n2021 Ethics & Compliance Training By-the-Numbers\n\n- ~364,000 total online courses delivered\n- ~6,000 in-person advanced compliance training modules delivered\n- ~64,000 employees and select contractor workers who completed ethics and compliance training\n- 4 required courses for employees\n- 1 customized contract worker course\n\nGM Code of Conduct: Winning with Integrity\nCybersecurity\nExport and Sanctions Compliance\nAntitrust and Competition Law Compliance\n\nOnce employees complete the Code of Conduct training, they are required to certify that they agree to comply with the policies contained in the Code; that they have disclosed any new potential conflicts of interest; and that they have reported any violations of the Code and any vehicle or workplace safety issues. In 2021, CRT in 2021 included:\n\n- GM Code of Conduct: Winning with Integrity\n- Cybersecurity\n- Export and Sanctions Compliance\n- Antitrust and Competition Law Compliance\n\nETHICS CONT.\nPublic Policy\n\nWe have consistently and publicly advocated for climate action and awareness, as well as policies that address climate change through economy-wide, market-based carbon pricing mechanisms.\n\nOur global commitment to an all-electric, zero-emissions future is unwavering, regardless of the prevailing vehicle emissions standards in any region in which we operate.\n\nWe advocated for passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) by the U.S. Congress in 2021, as we believe it puts the United States on the path toward strengthening the economy and advancing innovation. The IIJA also lays the foundation for sustainability policies that will help address climate change and improve environmental quality and resiliency. GM supports those goals and, critically, we support those provisions, such as electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, that accelerate the adoption of EVs and help to establish the United States as a global leader in electrification today and into the future. In August 2021, GM announced our plan to achieve sales of 40-50% of annual U.S. volumes of battery electric vehicles by 2030 in order to move the nation closer to a zero-emissions future consistent with the Paris Agreement.\n\nDemonstrating our readiness to engage in the climate policy debate, GM joined 41 other leading U.S. companies in signing a statement organized by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions as part of its Climate Innovation 2050 initiative. The statement called upon the Biden Administration and Congress in 2021 to enact ambitious, durable and bipartisan climate solutions. We believe this should include an economywide market-based approach that puts a value on carbon, as well as transformative levels of federal investment in the country\u2019s infrastructure\u2014including EV chargers and the grid\u2014to prepare for an electrified future.\n\nIt is critical that EV mandates are matched to appropriate complementary policies that accelerate EV adoption and put the United States in a leadership position to transform the auto industry and supply chain. We are encouraged by the provisions on EV infrastructure, EV supply chain and EV battery manufacturing and recycling development contained in the IIJA. Several of the provisions contained within the bill are consistent with aspects of GM\u2019s proposed National Zero Emissions Vehicle Program, first suggested by GM in 2018. We look forward to working with federal, state and local stakeholders to assist in the efficient distribution and use of these IIJA funds. To stimulate the rapid uptake of EVs, we continue to strongly support the extension and expansion of federal and state consumer rebates and tax incentives for new and used light- and heavy-duty EV purchase and lease, and charger installation.\n\nGlobal Fuel Economy and Emissions Regulation\n\nEmissions requirements have become more stringent around the world, driven by policy requirements in areas such as air quality, energy security and climate change. It is important that governments update their legacy regulations, like the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards in the United States, to reflect the rapidly changing transportation and mobility landscape. Properly designed standards will allow the entire global industry to accelerate the pace of innovation and better prepare for an all-electric future.\n\nOur global commitment to an all-electric, zero-emissions future is unwavering, regardless of the prevailing vehicle emissions standards in any region in which we operate.\n\nWe advocated for passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) by the U.S. Congress in 2021, as we believe it puts the United States on the path toward strengthening the economy and advancing innovation.

Properly designed standards will allow the entire global industry to accelerate the pace of innovation and better prepare for an all-electric future.\nGM envisions a future where we can all enjoy the benefits of vehicle use\u2014freedom, convenience and comfort\u2014while minimizing congestion. And, we are working on the technologies and engaging in the policy discussions that will make this future possible. GM has a well-established track record of engagement with innovative city and mobility initiatives such as the deployment of sustainable last-mile solutions. In Seattle, BrightDrop participated in one of the nation\u2019s first zero operating-emissions, last-mile neighborhood delivery hubs. In New York City, the integration of BrightDrop\u2019s Trace allowed couriers to remove one on-road vehicle from the delivery route and cut delivery vehicle curbside dwell time in half, when used on routes in a high-density, vertical urban environment\u2014all while reducing physical strain on couriers. Thoughtfully designed last-mile urban delivery solutions, such as BrightDrop, are a timely and critical component as competition for curb space creates safety and quality-of-life issues.\n\nAs cities continue to explore ways to tackle congestion in their communities, GM looks forward to building on this foundation through partnerships and constructive dialogue with stakeholders, pilot projects and other efforts that seek to leverage public policy to realize our vision of a future in which people can enjoy the freedom, convenience and comfort of vehicle use in cities with zero congestion.\n\nMany cities and states are already exploring these policies, finding that there could be a variety of ways to improve mobility for their residents. GM does not endorse any one approach but recognizes that cities and states are exploring all of these and believes a comprehensive strategy incorporating one or more policy levers could be successful. GM is prepared to engage with these debates to advance our zero congestion vision while bolstering our credibility as a messenger and stakeholder in this issue area.\n\nA combination of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology, new mobility solutions and policy will enable reductions in congestion through safety improvements, greater efficiencies in road use and reductions in traffic volumes. As we explore future markets for our AV and fleet offerings, we work closely with communities to find solutions together. Gains in efficiency and safety not only create opportunities for more equitable access to health care, education and employment, but can alleviate the negative effects of transportation networks.\n\nGM is optimistic that innovations in vehicle connectivity will help optimize traffic flows and reduce traffic crashes, ultimately easing congestion. We are focused on deploying advanced driver assistance technologies, such as Super Cruise and Ultra Cruise, and self-driving technology, through applications such as the Cruise Origin that we believe can help achieve these objectives.\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nCautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements: This report may include \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors that affect the subject of these statements, except where we are expressly required to do so by law.\n", "source": "general_motors_2021", "added": "2025-04-27", "created": "2025-04-27", "metadata": {"Source-File": "climate_reports/tp_reports/general_motors_2021.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.1.59", "pdf-total-pages": 122, "total-input-tokens": 269241, "total-output-tokens": 66676, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 14, 1], [14, 487, 2], [487, 3984, 3], [3984, 6969, 4], [6969, 9076, 5], [9076, 10028, 6], [10028, 12017, 7], [12017, 14362, 8], [14362, 17126, 9], [17126, 19626, 10], [19626, 23449, 11], [23449, 28516, 12], [28516, 31322, 13], [31322, 34535, 14], [34535, 35478, 15], [35478, 37975, 16], [37975, 41105, 17], [41105, 44247, 18], [44247, 46616, 19], [46616, 49394, 20], [49394, 50698, 21], [50698, 53456, 22], [53456, 56940, 23], [56940, 59368, 24], [59368, 61378, 25], [61378, 63760, 26], [63760, 66406, 27], [66406, 68359, 28], [68359, 69348, 29], [69348, 70665, 30], [70665, 72555, 31], [72555, 73655, 32], [73655, 77751, 33], [77751, 78570, 34], [78570, 82776, 35], [82776, 84759, 36], [84759, 87506, 37], [87506, 91401, 38], [91401, 95439, 39], [95439, 98689, 40], [98689, 99563, 41], [99563, 103653, 42], [103653, 106019, 43], [106019, 109622, 44], [109622, 111521, 45], [111521, 114234, 46], [114234, 115866, 47], [115866, 116587, 48], [116587, 119258, 49], [119258, 121945, 50], [121945, 124056, 51], [124056, 127224, 52], [127224, 128183, 53], [128183, 130005, 54], [130005, 131903, 55], [131903, 133090, 56], [133090, 137063, 57], [137063, 140527, 58], [140527, 143558, 59], [143558, 145624, 60], [145624, 149849, 61], [149849, 153039, 62], [153039, 154021, 63], [154021, 155156, 64], [155156, 157684, 65], [157684, 159219, 66], [159219, 163252, 67], [163252, 165456, 68], [165456, 167589, 69], [167589, 170724, 70], [170724, 173481, 71], [173481, 176444, 72], [176444, 179217, 73], [179217, 183215, 74], [183215, 187530, 75], [187530, 190019, 76], [190019, 194418, 77], [194418, 194928, 78], [194928, 198816, 79], [198816, 203144, 80], [203144, 206274, 81], [206274, 207149, 82], [207149, 209590, 83], [209590, 212914, 84], [212914, 215923, 85], [215923, 218018, 86], [218018, 220044, 87], [220044, 223708, 88], [223708, 224186, 89], [224186, 225343, 90], [225343, 230008, 91], [230008, 233394, 92], [233394, 235326, 93], [235326, 238492, 94], [238492, 241607, 95], [241607, 243787, 96], [243787, 246867, 97], [246867, 249041, 98], [249041, 249967, 99], [249967, 252250, 100], [252250, 254605, 101], [254605, 257072, 102], [257072, 259609, 103], [259609, 261963, 104], [261963, 262802, 105], [262802, 265695, 106], [265695, 267798, 107], [267798, 270188, 108], [270188, 273820, 109], [273820, 277916, 110], [277916, 281777, 111], [281777, 284827, 112], [284827, 287559, 113], [287559, 288861, 114], [288861, 292065, 115], [292065, 294803, 116], [294803, 299736, 117], [299736, 303326, 118], [303326, 309827, 119], [309827, 312694, 120], [312694, 314075, 121], [314075, 314075, 122]]}}
