In this period of time marked by various market and geopolitical challenges, Stellantis proved to be strong, vibrant and even more determined to \"dare forward\" as we seized opportunities to achieve the 2030 strategic plan.\n\nWe accelerated our transformation into a sustainable mobility tech company, guided by the ambition to rethink the way we move while reducing our carbon footprint. We have the ingenuity, drive, and focus to keep Stellantis at the forefront of the future of mobility.\n\nWe do it not only by building iconic vehicles and creating innovative services. We are also shaping a diverse and inclusive organization, one that gathers people and ideas across borders and cultures to exceed our customers' different needs and foster their freedom.\n\nAs part of the wider society, Stellantis pursues its stringent environmental, social and governance policy, acting as a steward for the communities where it operates.\n\nThe first Stellantis Student Awards is a primary example of it. Started 26 years ago, this year\u2019s program recognized more than 600 students from 20 countries around the world with monetary awards for their dedication to continuous learning and education. We are proud to support those who are committed to building a sustainable, better future: for the world and for themselves.\n\nThe Stellantis Foundation, our philanthropic arm aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, aims to support projects identified at both local and global levels to impact our communities. Stellantis is driven by our social commitment, to empower people through access to education and mobility.\n\nThanks to our shareholders, who facilitate our steady development, Stellantis will continue to lead the way the world moves and help make the planet more sustainable for future generations.\n\nFebruary 24, 2023\n\n/s/\nJohn Elkann\nChairman\nMESSAGE FROM THE CEO\n\nThis was a year where disruptions seemed relentless with cumulative crises. War, weaker economic conditions, and an intensifying climate crisis caused exceptional uncertainty, requiring businesses to deliver results while becoming more and more resilient and agile. Even in this context, Stellantis continued its transformation to a sustainable mobility tech company at a pace not yet seen in our industry.\n\nStellantis pursued this balancing act by launching our Dare Forward 2030 long-term strategic plan in March 2022. The bold business plan aims to achieve greater efficiency with a breakeven point among the lowest in the industry, enabling us to respond to turbulence while bolstering our position on the global tech scene.\n\nThe plan is anchored in an ambitious decarbonization strategy consistent with science-based recommendations. Through aggressive and clear targets, it sets out deep emission cuts to slash CO\u2082 in half by 2030\u00b9, benchmarking our 2021 metrics, and putting us on track to achieve carbon net zero by 2038\u00b2.\n\nOur electrification offer continued at lightning speed. We unveiled our latest battery electric vehicles, including the all-new Jeep\u00ae Avenger, the first-ever fully electric Jeep SUV and the European Car of the Year for 2023. We do not focus solely on battery power, though.\n\nOur growth also relies on a hydrogen fuel cell zero emission solution. This technology is particularly suited to the needs of light commercial vehicle customers and is already available for Peugeot, Citro\u00ebn, and Opel mid-size vans. To further reinforce our role as a front runner in this field, we recently announced our plans to acquire a substantial stake in Symbio, a global leader in zero-emission hydrogen mobility.\n\nAs we work to achieve a decarbonized world, we continued strengthening our global electrification ecosystem with leading partners that share with us the same environmental objectives, including Automotive Cells Company, LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI, and Factorial, to name a few. At the end of 2022, we also deepened our strategic partnership with Archer and are now joining forces to manufacture the flagship electric vertical take-off and landing (\u201ceVTOL\u201d) aircraft, Midnight.\n\nWe also put a greater focus on a rigorous, 360-degree circular economy business aimed at bringing additional financial value to the Company and providing a more sustainable path for the scarce resources of our planet.\n\nAnd building on our software know-how, we demonstrated how human-focused innovation is enabling us to embrace the future and render the status quo obsolete. Our software team is building a promising business with several decisive partnerships signed with world-class tech companies: Amazon, Foxconn and Qualcomm.\n\n\u00b9Scopes 1-2-3 intensity tons of CO\u2082-eq/veh\n\u00b2With single-digit percent compensation\nStellantis also shifted its lobbying approach toward a more direct and transparent interaction with citizens and stakeholders supporting the Freedom of Mobility Forum. Planned for early 2023, the forum will be a meeting of passionate problem solvers committed to fact-based discussion addressing how we can bring sustainable mobility in the face of global warming implications.\n\nWe combined all these activities with financial sustainability, recording a 13.0 percent margin in the face of stiff competition. We delivered Net revenues of \u20ac179.6 billion, which is up 18 percent. We registered Adjusted operating income of \u20ac23.3 billion, up 29 percent, and Net profit from continuing operations of \u20ac16.8 billion, up 26 percent.\n\nIt was a stellar performance made possible by the huge commitment of our people and the crucial support of our shareholders.\n\nThese elements give me the confidence that what you have seen from Stellantis in our first two years is just a glimpse of the major impact we will have on mobility ecosystems in the future.\n\nPowered by our diversity, we will continue to lead the way the world moves, delivering cutting-edge products and services that provide clean, safe and affordable mobility solutions on the roads, and in the air.\n\nThis is the mission that guides us daily and our commitment to the society in which we operate.\n\nFebruary 24, 2023\n\n/s/\nCarlos Tavares\nChief Executive Officer\n## Contributions to SDGs Table\n\n| 6 CSR MACRO-RISKS / PILLARS | 22 CSR ISSUES / CHALLENGES |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Bringing a tangible impact on climate change | 1.

STAKEHOLDERS\n\nCreating shared and lasting value for our stakeholders\n\nWe acknowledge that long-term success is achieved by linking economic growth with respect, financial performance with social responsibility, and industrial development with environmental stewardship.\n\nTo create and share value, we engage our stakeholders: our employees, our customers, our partners, our suppliers, our host territories and their communities, our investors and the environment through dialogue and activities.\n\nAs a leading company and member of the Global Compact, we are committed to shaping a better future through a strong sense of responsibility and leadership in a new era of sustainable mobility. The 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals are a framework for our actions in the transition to a more sustainable future.\n\n1.1.4.1 Value created for Stellantis long-term investors\n\nResponsible business conduct is key to secure long-term financial performance.\n\nThis long-term performance is essentially based on a stable and balanced capital structure that supports the rollout of strategic projects and a robust strategic plan, designed to meet the mobility needs of our customers.\n\nWith the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, Stellantis has set ambitious targets in the fight against climate change, aiming to reach carbon net zero emissions by 2038, with a 50% reduction by 2030. Taking a significant role in decarbonization, as well as a decisive step forward in the circular economy, is Stellantis\u2019 contribution to a sustainable future.\n\nAs part of that leadership, our comprehensive strategy includes the following targets:\n\n- **an electric product offensive** supported by plans to invest more than \u20ac30 billion through 2025 in electrification and software development, including equity investments made in joint ventures to fund their activities, while targeting to continue to be 30 percent more efficient than the industry with respect to total CapEx and research and development spend versus revenues. Stellantis will utilize three different Electric Drive Modules adaptable to all our platforms, covering all vehicles worldwide and sharing a high level of commonality, in order to optimize the overall cost efficiency by reducing complexity, eliminating duplication and improving development efficiency. Each of our four platforms will be designed to allow the production of up to two million units per year. This will guarantee a critical size for optimized investments and competitive unit cost. This is a key success factor for our value optimization. On March 1, 2022, Stellantis announced it plans to have more than 75 BEVs (sum of EU and NA portfolios) and reach a global annual BEV sales of five million vehicles by 2030, reaching 100% of passenger car BEV sales mix in Europe and 50% passenger cars and light-duty trucks in the U.S. To support this ambition, the Company will work to develop a global EV battery sourcing strategy of over 400 GWh by 2030, with up to five gigafactories between Europe and North America are being developed with partners. Battery packs will be tailored for a variety of vehicles \u2013 from smaller city cars to energy-dense packs for performance vehicles and trucks.\n\nThe plan also includes the use of two battery chemistries by 2024 to support various customer needs: a high energy-density option and a nickel cobalt-free alternative. By 2026, the first competitive solid state battery technology is targeted to be introduced.\n\n6 With single-digit % compensation of remaining emissions by 2038.\nSETTING UP FULL ECOSYSTEM TO SUPPORT ELECTRIFICATION GROWTH\n\nELECTRIFICATION ACCELERATION\n\nBEV Sales Leadership in EU30\n#1 Commercial Vehicles, #2 Overall\n\n#1 U.S. PHEV Sales\n\n|        | FY '21 | FY '22 |\n|--------|--------|--------|\n| BEV    | 390    | 288    |\n| PHEV   | 186    | 224    |\n\nGlobal LEV Sales\n000 units\n\nBEV PORTFOLIO\nTo More Than Double In 2 Years\n\n|        | Today | 2023 | 2024 | 2030 Sales Mix |\n|--------|-------|------|------|----------------|\n| Global | 23    | 32   | 47   | 75+            |\n|        | 22    | 30   | 42   | 60+ 100%       |\n|        | -     | 3    | 8    | 25+ 50%        |\n\nMASTERING ELECTRIFICATION VALUE CHAIN\n\n5 GIGAFACTORIES\n\n| Partner | Location | GWh | SOP |\n|---------|----------|-----|-----|\n| ACC     | Douvrin   | 40  | 2023|\n| Kaiserslautern | 40 | 2025|\n| Termoli | 40       | 2026|\n| LG Energy Solution | 45+ | 2024|\n| SAMSUNG SDI | Kokomo | 33+ | 2025|\n\nRAW MATERIAL PARTNERSHIPS\n\n- Battery grade lithium hydroxide\n- Battery grade lithium hydroxide\n- Nickel and Cobalt Sulphate Supply\n- Manganese Sulphate Supply\n- Low-Carbon Nickel Sulphate Supply\n\ne-PROPULSION SYSTEMS PARTNERSHIPS\n\n- Electric motors\n- Electrified dual clutch transmission\n- Solid-state battery\n- Fuel cell stack\n\nExcerpt from Stellantis FY '22 Results\nhttps://www.stellantis.com/content/dam/stellantis-corporate/investors/events-and-presentations/presentations/Stellantis_FY_22_Results_Presentation.pdf\n\nFor definitions and notes to slide refer to related Appendix\nthe execution of the synergy opportunities arising from the formation of Stellantis, with \u20ac7.1 billion net cash synergies achieved by the end of 2022, more than two years ahead of \u20ac5.0 billion annual steady state target, a forecast to maintain break-even point at less than 50% of consolidated shipments, the of battery cost reductions, and the continued optimization of distribution and production costs and realization of new revenue streams, in particular from connected services and future software business models\n\nthe vertical integration from the pack down to the cell design to get all the benefits from the chemistry active materials that are so useful and precious.

These changes require increased electrification, automation, digital transformation, new production and sales processes to design and offer new products and mobility services meeting customers\u2019 new expectations. Employees expect transparency that includes their contribution to the future of the Company and how the Company supports the surrounding communities where we operate.\n\nTogether with employee representatives and the unions, the Company is fostering a diverse culture, in which all join forces to build the future, and where teams can compete to demonstrate and develop their talent. Our human resources policy allows our employees to:\n\nDevelop in a culture where solutions are designed collaboratively\n\nOur co-construction approach with our social partners to anticipate and manage upcoming transformation is a pillar we have implemented since the beginning of the merger through collective agreements.\n\nIn addition, Stellantis encourages and transforms employee\u2019s ideas and promotes an entrepreneurship spirit within the Company though the Star*Up program as an internal incubator.\n\nTake ownership of their career by developing their skills and prepare for the future\n\nStellantis focuses on ensuring a global approach for skills transformation, leveraging on global job families\u2019 policy and proper ramp-up plans and on setting up a global network of expertise as a lever to be front runner in tech leadership. The Job Family approach provides a worldwide and cross-functional jobs and skills foundation for Stellantis, which is fully integrated with talent management and learning policies.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the creation of Stellantis, the software and electrification strategy is a highly relevant topic shared with the social partners. In order to staff the new Software Division, a recruitment effort is deployed in five main hubs, U.S., India, Italy, France and Germany, to provide software critical skills from the global tech labor market. The hiring process started in July 2021 and allowed the onboarding of 300 newcomers at most levels in 2021 and recruit up to 761 new employees in 2022 in this area. Furthermore, a Data and Software Academy was launched in 2022 to upskill and reskill over 1,000 Stellantis employees per year in software professions and reconvert internal existing talents into skills critical for the Company in the future.\n\nThe Data & Software Academy is also working on an innovative format to have content available 24 hours a day seven days a week by developing a 3D virtual online academy that is slated to launch in 2023. The idea of the virtual 3D academy is to propose a place that is accessible, at any time, using innovative technologies with a metaverse approach integrating a Virtual Reality experience to complement the experience and provide the feeling of being together with the teacher and colleagues.\nThe Electrification Academy delivers **global e-learning programs around electrification and e-Mobility**. In 2022, as part of the global upskilling on electrification, 56,700 employees were trained on the global e-Mobility and electrification fundamentals, through e-learning modules. The people trained on electrification-related topics within several professions have been 14,500 with 94,000 hours delivered.\n\nThe Star*Up program, launched globally in 2021, is a program aimed at encouraging and transforming our employee's ideas and promoting an intrapreneurship spirit within Stellantis. Employees were invited to submit their ideas and each region selected the top ideas to enter a three-month incubation phase. Each idea is accompanied by an internal coach and the Incubees have access to a Platform with an introduction to innovation methods such as Design Thinking and Lean Startup, essential to achieve success of the project. At the end of the incubation, winners of the regional finals enter a 9-to-12 month experimentation towards first customers and first revenues in the Business Factory. Stellantis also encourages and transforms employee's ideas and promotes an entrepreneurship spirit within the Company. In 2022, 990 ideas have been proposed, 193 pitches and 59 have been incubated (versus 31 in 2021).\n\nThe Company invested approximately \u20ac197 million in training during 2022 which is 1.13% of employee wage expenses, delivering about 3.17 million hours of training to approximately 208,535 employees. Through its Data and Software Academy launched in 2022 Stellantis has upskilled and reskilled over 1,000 Stellantis employees in software professions and reconvert internal existing talents into skills critical for the Company.\n\n**Work in an environment that promotes health, wellbeing and flexible work life balance**\n\n**Wellbeing program:**\n\nIn July 2022 Stellantis launched a new program dedicated to the wellbeing of all its employees: My Wellbeing. Through this program, that supports the Care pillar in the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, Stellantis has an ambitious vision of its employees' wellbeing which complements its health and safety fundamentals, occupational health, safety, ergonomics and contributes to making Stellantis a great company to work for.\n\n**Work life balance:**\n\nEstablishing a collaborative work method is incorporated into the social dialogue and applies to workspaces as well as the expansion of remote working. The goal is to offer more flexible work arrangements without damaging collective productivity. The New Era of Agility program is an innovative hybrid concept allowing eligible employees to remote work up to 70%. Enhancing work-life balance leads to better performance and reduces stress as well as adding flexibility across the various regions by reducing commute time. In several countries we have established the right to disconnect either in the contracts, charters, policies or internal communications.\nShowcase their talents in an inclusive environment where diversity is an asset\n\nAs set forth in our Code of Conduct, Stellantis is committed to gender equality, and is aligned with the vision of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on Gender Equality. Also, Stellantis intends to sign up to the UN Women\u2019s Empowerment Principles, which encourages companies to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women in the workplace, industry and community.\n\nWith this commitment, the Company shares its intention to adopt business practices that support gender equality and empower women within the Stellantis organization, globally and across the automotive industry.\n\nStellantis voluntarily formalized its actions in favor of diversity in its social dialogue. On an international scale, the Collective Bargaining Agreements on Social Responsibility are committed to exceeding local legal requirements in applying and promoting the fight against racism, sexism, xenophobia and homophobia and, more generally, against intolerance of differences and safeguarding respect for privacy.\n\nStellantis is firmly committed to respect and support human rights in all of our activities, in all of the countries in which we operate. Stellantis pledges its commitment to respecting human rights throughout its entire supply chain, as describes in its Human Rights Policy. In support of its commitments to human rights, Stellantis seeks to apply standards that protect our workers, enhance our integrity across the organization and provide effective grievance mechanisms to employees and stakeholders. Human rights are the foundation of our diversity and inclusion policy.\n\n- the gender equality policy is enforced worldwide and monitored with a female/male wage ratio. In 2022, it was 0.94 for blue collars and 0.91 for white collars\n- Stellantis received the label \u201cHappy Trainees\u201d in the category \u201cinternational\u201d initiated by \u201cChoose my company\u201d, that rewards companies that have particularly distinguished themselves in welcoming its trainees, apprentices and VIE (Volunteer International Experience) within its institutions\n- Stellantis seeks to strengthen the place of more experienced employees and considers them an advantage for the Company\u2019s success. Through mentoring programs, the Company encourages knowledge transfer, builds leaders who model inclusion through trust, transparency and feedback. This exchange and the coexistence of generations is considered as an asset for social cohesion and business performance. In 2022, 98,500 Stellantis employees aged over 50 years (versus 91,812 Stellantis employees aged over 50 years in 2021)\n- Stellantis policy regarding social and occupational inclusion of people with disabilities is enacted worldwide through various collective agreements with the goal of keeping workers with disabilities employed, carrying out preventive actions and promoting their integration into the workplace. In 2022, 8,885 disabled employees.\n1.1.4.4 Value created for suppliers and partners\n\nStellantis\u2019 large and complex supply chain is an opportunity for suppliers and partners to get involved in a worldwide eco-system facing major changes in its technological choices, customers\u2019 habits and expectations and new approaches to mobility in local markets.\n\nStellantis is committed to sustainable practices in its procurement activity, notably inspired by the due diligence approach advocated by the OECD and the ILO rules. The selection of suppliers is based not only on the quality and on competitiveness of their products and services, but also on their adherence to social, ethical and environmental principles (third party assessment) and their ability to provide innovative solutions to support Stellantis face such challenges as climate change and wise use of natural resources and raw materials.\n\n* Snapdragon and Qualcomm branded products are products of Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. and/or its subsidiaries.\nThe Stellantis Responsible Purchasing Guidelines require new and renew suppliers to sign the guidelines and grant awards are based on:\n\n- **Innovation**\n  Stellantis involves its core and strategic suppliers in a disruptive innovation process, which is essential in order to meet commitments on reducing CO\u2082 emissions, air quality, and finding more sustainable materials e.g., increased recycled content for use in our products at a cost acceptable to customers. In 2022, 1,177 patents applications were published by Stellantis. Stellantis\u2019 suppliers participated in more than 10 Technology Day events in 2022, seven of which were at Stellantis facilities in Europe and North America and more online or at supplier facilities. These events encourage collaboration with Stellantis personnel and suppliers on innovative solutions for features, efficiencies and quality, and allow suppliers to share their latest technological developments and concepts for the future.\n\nStellantis, as of 2022, is engaged in 21 joint innovation projects with 19 suppliers to identify and implement technologies that reduce CO\u2082 emissions of the vehicles as well as in the production of parts.\n\n- **Efficiency**\n  The CSR commitments that the Company asks its suppliers to make, enable them to reduce their own operational risks. Suppliers are well-informed of best practices and regulatory changes, and can therefore benchmark themselves by comparing their performance against the industry average, build on their strengths and implement action plans to work on any weaknesses. Stellantis monitors the progress of the action plans required from suppliers. If necessary, it can help them find solutions to improve their product quality or optimize their processes.\n\n- **Economic performance**\n  In view of the demanding supplier selection process, being a strategic or core supplier of Stellantis demonstrates a high-level of economic and CSR performance. Through innovation partnerships with Stellantis, suppliers are developing a competitive edge. This distinguishes them from their competitors when bidding for contracts in other markets. They can create commercial opportunities with customers who, like Stellantis, regard CSR criteria as a key aspect of the supplier selection and listing process. The Company\u2019s suppliers can communicate their own CSR commitment and performance (notably their EcoVadis score) to their customers and/or host regions. Similarly, in being chosen to support Stellantis on international projects, companies are boosting their prospects by increasing their presence and competitiveness in new markets.\n\n- **CSR performance**\n  The Company\u2019s responsible purchasing approach drives attention to validated CSR performance from our suppliers. Our policy is to work with suppliers in a partnership to improve CSR performance overall. These expectations are an integral part of the supplier relationship and require a continuous focus to ensure we apply the needed resources to achieve top ranking status. This approach has created results that have Stellantis supplier CSR performance that is...\nclearly above the EcoVadis benchmark. Stellantis also requests the adoption and sharing of sustainable practices among business partners, suppliers and dealers. The third-party assessment of suppliers based on CSR criteria encourages suppliers to be vigilant for CSR risks within their supply chain. Detailed scores in those external CSR assessments allow suppliers to launch action plans to improve their labor and purchasing practices and reduce their environmental impact.\n\nAs a response to the climate change challenge, Stellantis is notably transitioning to electric technology for mobility devices, which rely on raw materials necessary to produce battery components. Some materials pose human rights risks in the supply chain (lithium, aluminum, cobalt). Stellantis annually maps the sourcing of materials that are essential to electric vehicle battery manufacturing, and is a member of global multi partner initiatives (RCS Global, Drive Sustainability notably) to improve risk-identification in the supply chains. Stellantis suppliers are invited to join forces in those global approaches and required to disclose to the Company their raw material suppliers. This allows them to challenge their own supply chains to ensure a better risk coverage. The Company\u2019s responsible purchasing approach is useful in making its suppliers part of a positive trend. In 2022, the average score in EcoVadis of Stellantis suppliers was 54.6 in the environmental category and 54.1 for human rights, outperforming all suppliers assessed by EcoVadis, which had an average score of 44.7 and 47.6 respectively.\n\n1.1.4.5 Value created for host communities and civil society\n\nA support to the social and solidarity economy and to communities:\n\n- **raising awareness of environmental protection among young people**: The e-Mobility Business Unit and DS Automobiles presented the Stellantis strategy in terms of sustainable mobility during the Giffoni Next Generation event to over 5,000 under-30s \u2013 the \u201cGiffoners\u201d about the impact of our actions on the planet.\n\n- **Socially responsible and educational projects**:\n  - In 2022, a Stellantis Foundation grant supported 80 high-school-level FIRST Robotics teams, many mentored by Stellantis employees, as well as the state championship event in Michigan.

Stellantis works with six major French associations and with the Spanish association ILUNION. In total, 11 of our vehicle plants in Europe are working with the sheltered sector. The services bought in 2022 from the adapted and sheltered sector added up to \u20ac50 million.\n\nContribution to road safety, both now and in the future: Stellantis is contributing to the definition of road safety through:\n- strong commitment in safety-related standardization activities (e.g., Functional Safety and Safety of the Intended Functionality, relevant for autonomous driving and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS))\n- participation to several cooperative projects regarding the safety of autonomous driving\n- development of international industry standards in cybersecurity notably through participation in the Automotive-Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Auto-ISAC).\n\nStellantis presented its contributions to the L3Pilot automated driving project at the L3Pilot final event in Hamburg, Germany, in conjunction with ITS World Congress, in October 2021. The event included driving demonstrations on nearby motorways with several vehicles with Level 3 technologies. The piloting phase covered a wide range of driving situations, including parking, overtaking on highways, driving through urban intersections and in close distance scenarios. This tested Level 3 automated driving functions such as Motorway Chauffeur (high-speed driving and\nautomated lane change), Traffic Jam Chauffeur (Low-speed driving in congested roads), Remote Parking (in parallel and cross-parking scenarios), Home Zone (path memory for repetitive maneuvers to park in and out in parking areas). A fleet of sixteen Stellantis prototypes was deployed in different scenarios and driving situations and exposed to variable conditions across several European countries to collect data, detect scenarios and evaluate all aspects of the road tests, to answer key questions bringing these systems to the market.\n\nMany important research institutes are involved with Stellantis in this field (i.e., SystemX and VEDECOM in France). Stellantis also leverages several major cooperative funded projects such as L3Pilot (project finished in 2021 on level 3 driving pre-deployment project), HiDrive (in use monitoring of driver for Level 3), successors of PEGASUS in Germany (Set Level 4 to 5, etc.) and SAM (Scenario database for ADAS and Autonomous driving Level 3) in France. Several projects are also in place for the development of the technologies on autonomous driving and connectivity such as Imagine (V2X) in Germany and C-ROADS (V2X), Mise VeDi 2025 and Mise Scala AD in Europe.\n\nIn addition, the Joint Research Laboratory (Joint LAB), with Valeo and Safran on Artificial Intelligence for Driving Automation (Level 2/Level 3) is noteworthy among our current research partnerships.\n\nIn the area of tertiary safety, or post-accident emergency response, Stellantis provides emergency rescue sheets with information to rescue teams or first responders on special design elements and the position of components to be considered when assisting the occupants of vehicles involved in an accident. In addition, connectivity functions provide assistance when an accident or health related incident occurs in the vehicle. The occupants are connected with a dedicated assistance center that pinpoints the vehicle. For instance, motorway control centers in Europe are automatically warned of any accidents on their roads via the emergency call service in the Company\u2019s equipped vehicles as this is becoming a legal obligation in Europe.\n\n75% of Stellantis model are offered with Lane Keeping Assist technologies (versus 57% in 2021).\n\nSupport to the economic development of host communities:\n\n- Launched in 2021, the Black Supplier Development Program continued also this year, in collaboration with the National Business League (NBL), to develop Black suppliers for future contracting and procurement opportunities in the pursuit of greater racial equity in the marketplace. The Stellantis-NBL National Black Supplier Development Program will support the development of Black businesses around the country and internationally for future opportunities within the federal government and public and private sectors.\n\n- Technology eco-system: Stellantis aims at being more and more recognized as a technology company able to bring innovative systems and services to its customers. Stellantis works with stakeholders of the eco-system; this includes suppliers, technology organizations and research institutes. All maturity phases of the technology (TRL \u2013 Technology Readiness Levels) are of vital importance for the Company and, in particular partnerships with universities contribute to the lower TRLs, basic scientific research and advanced research, providing disruptive and relevant affordable mobility solutions and services in decarbonization, automatization, circular economy areas.\nSupport to the scientific development of host communities:\n\n- **Engaging the universities**: Stellantis partners with several international universities to get the best knowledge and keep in touch with new talent.

Several universities in France in collaboration aimed at providing Stellantis with PhDs working for the Company for three years Polytechnics of Milan and Turin, University La Sapienza in Rome and Federico II in Naples (Italy) in collaboration aimed at providing Stellantis with PhDs working for the Company for three year.\n\n- **Scientific Education**: Stellantis continued to support scientific education, notably, through the CERN project unveiled in 2019 in Geneva, Switzerland. This ambitious and innovative Science Gateway project is a hub for scientific education and culture, meant to raise awareness, curiosity and love for science in every dimension for the most people possible. The exhibitions will feature CERN's accelerators, experiments and computing, how scientists use them in their exploration and how CERN technologies benefit society. Hands-on experimentation will be a key part of the Science Gateway's educational program, allowing visitors to experience first-hand what it is like to be a scientist. The immersive activities available in the Science Gateway will foster critical thinking, evidence-based assessment and use of the scientific method which are important tools in all walks of life. The building supported through the grant is expected to be ready in May 2023. The school project also is progressing, with plans to train the first 100 teachers in Spring 2023.\n\n1.1.4.6 Value created for the environment\n\n**Technological choices for a concrete impact**\n\n- **Eco-design and life cycle assessment to boost innovation**: Stellantis conducts LCAs (Life Cycle Assessment) on its vehicles and components to reduce material consumption and environmental impact of materials. These studies analyze the multi-criteria environmental footprint of a vehicle and validate its components and materials design. The entire product life cycle is taken into account from raw material extraction to manufacture, use and end-of-life. Analyses are conducted using software linked to environmental databases that makes it possible to calculate a product's environmental impact. The goal is to compare the environmental impact from a new model compared to the previous generation. LCAs can be used in the innovation phase to consider environmental impact as early as possible. The analyses are usually conducted at the end of product design and include recyclability and critical materials. LCA results can also be used in the planning of future vehicles. In 2022, LCAs covered 69% of the total fleet sold (versus 62% in 2021).\nA Circular Economy Business Unit to extend products lifespan and reduce waste\n\n- In order to further master the wise use of materials in the vehicle life cycle and reduce the environmental impact in terms of carbon footprint, Stellantis has created a Business Unit dedicated to circular economy. As one of the seven accretive Business Units outlined in Stellantis\u2019 March 1, 2022 Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, its aim is to build a sustainable and profitable business based on circular economy principles investigating and expanding opportunities in various areas such as the use of plant surplus (excess of parts and materials from factories), parts remanufacturing, repairing, end-of-life vehicle management and recycled materials in a closed-loop process. In 2022, the Business Unit also launched SUSTAINera as the Stellantis Circular Economy Label for all reman, repair, reuse, recycle parts. In terms of geographical extension, the Circular Economy Business Unit started to develop a new remanufactured parts offer in South America. In addition, in September 2022, Stellantis announced the creation of its first industrial hub in Italy dedicated to circular economy in order to support the growth ambition in this business.\n\n- **Sustainable spare parts offer in a circular economy mindset:** The dealer network, promotes circular economy through various offerings: remanufactured parts, repair services in Europe and reused parts from end-of-life vehicles dismantling.\n\n- **Affordable maintenance with replacement parts for all budgets in a circular economy mindset:** The total range of sustainable parts covers more than 13% of customers aftersales needs and aims to help reduce the cost of vehicle ownership, decrease the volume of materials heading to landfills and lower energy consumption.\n\n- **Remanufactured Parts:** Remanufactured product lines include parts such as starters, alternators, brake calipers, electronic control modules, high-voltage battery packs, torque converters, steering, suspension and engine and transmission product categories. Depending on the part, the average raw-material usage is reduced between 60% to 95%, while CO\u2082 emissions are reduced between 30% to 80% compared with new part production (values determined according to a methodology approved by an independent company - Sphera). The Company certifies the production of remanufactured parts, manufactured internally or through specialized providers, in order to provide a sustainable solution that is equivalent to original equipment parts and provides the same warranty conditions as new parts.\n\n  REMAN offer has been launched in Brazil, South America in Q2 2022.

In 2022 we confirmed the extension of E-Repair Centers Regional coverage to 21 centers, strengthening the presence in Enlarged Europe and opening in India and Asia Pacific region.\n\n  **Second-life:** Stellantis is also continuing to work on solutions to repurpose for reuse HVBs in non-automotive business in order to use batteries as long as possible before sending them to recycling, prioritizing Second-life activities. In 2022 Stellantis has collaborated with several utility companies and battery integrators by providing Second-life batteries and collaborating with them in designing and creating energy storage facilities.\n\n  **Recycling Process:** in 2021, the partner\u2019s recycling rates were 69.3% for Lithium-Ion (Li-ion) batteries and 83.8% for Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries. The results for 2022 are not yet available at the time of publication of this report. These rates are significantly higher than the 50% regulatory thresholds for recycling efficiency. This agreement covers the dealership networks and industrial sites for all current Li-ion and NiMH batteries across all European marketing countries.\n\n\u25a0 **Revenue generation from Circular Economy Business Unit** The Dare Forward ambition for the Circular Economy Business Unit is to reach \u20ac2 billion total revenue generation by 2030 on this scope of activities.\n\n\u25a0 **Green materials:** Stellantis is involved in a large number of scientific partnerships to boost the development of the green materials industry and expand the use of these materials in vehicles.\n\nThe latest vehicles brought to the market illustrate the results obtained on the inclusion of materials that are recycled or from natural sources. The following examples show the diversity of applications validated on the last vehicles from the different brands in the main regions of commercialization, as follows:\n\n- **Jeep Renegade** (Upland Special Edition) in the interior trims of the dashboard has adopted recycled PC/ABS and an extensive use of textiles based on recycled PET.\n- **Maserati Grecale** in the tufted floor carpets uses recycled polyamide derived from disused fish nets recovered in the sea.\n- **Peugeot 408** integrates 100% of post-consumer P/E-I in the Mudguard components and a combination of 95% post-consumer and 5% post-industry polypropylene in the bumper.\n- **Fiat Fastback** extended the use of polypropylene and wood fibers composite materials to cargo load floor in the trunk.\n- **Citro\u00ebn C3** in South America achieved a historic result for the region with a high mass of green materials applied in eleven different applications, with emphasis on applications in recycled polypropylene.\nA holistic approach to support carbon neutrality and biodiversity recovery, reduce resource use and environmental impacts\n\nStellantis considers its impacts on the environment with a 360\u00b0 and pragmatic approach:\n\n- **Inside the Company boundaries:**\n  - launching an electric product offensive, which aims to sell 100% of electric passengers car sales in Europe and 50% of passengers car and light duty truck sales in North America by 2030, reaching 100% by 2038.\n  - reducing vehicle diversity. Mindful of vehicle CO\u2082 emissions regulations compliance, Stellantis is reducing its vehicle diversity to focus on developing environmentally friendly technologies that can be rolled out on a large scale.\n  - investing in manufacturing process improvements to transform production locations in a more efficient and sustainable condition to reduce their CO\u2082 emissions (through energy efficiency and increased usage of renewable energy), their water consumption and their waste.\n    - The CO\u2082 emitted resulted in 3,443 tons of CO\u2082-eq versus 3,874 tons of CO\u2082-eq emitted in 2021\n    - In 2022, Stellantis generated in total 302,858 tons of waste versus 305,468 tons in 2021, and withdrew in total 26,661 thousand m\u00b3 of water versus 27,540 thousand m\u00b3 of water in 2021\n    - In 2022, 65% of all the active plants have been qualified as zero waste to landfill facilities and 100% of metal waste is recycled. 92% of plants have ISO 14001 certification\n\n- **upstream:**\n  - engaging suppliers on climate-related issues: as of 2022, more than 65% of our most important suppliers (based on APV) commit to a CO\u2082 trend which complies with the Paris Agreement\n  - associating them to decarbonized energy: In South America, Stellantis works to measure, manage and reduce the annual GHG emissions produced by the daily activities of the plants through an emission inventory verified by third parties. The reduction of emissions is the result of the combination of actions focused on energy efficiency, use of energy from a renewable source and substitution of fossil fuel for ethanol and electricity in motor-propulsion. The effort to reduce emissions gradually extends to the supply chain and dealership networks, through actions that seek to meet the objectives established in the Stellantis\u2019 long-term strategic plan Dare Forward 2030. Stellantis was also recognized by the Brazilian GHG Protocol Program with Gold Seal for the completion and certification of the GHG emissions inventory.\n\nCompleting an inventory of emission sources is a key step in the roadmap to achieving carbon net zero by 2038.\n\n- **downstream:**\n  - providing customers with green energy solutions through day to day smart charging offers:\n    - A partnership signed between Stellantis and Digital Charging Solutions GmbH, will provide Jeep 4xe or Fiat EV customers access to the digital service \u201cMy easy Charge,\u201d offering them a single provider for the largest charging network in the world. With just one app and one single card the charging solution will provide access to more than 130,000 charge points in 21 European countries.\nA partnership was also formed between the Jeep Brand and Electrify America to install solar charging stations on Jeep Trails in North America in March 2021.\n\nStellantis\u2019 partnership with NHOA is developing Atlante, a public Fast and Ultra-Fast Charging network in Southern Europe. The network will be enabled by renewables and energy storage and 100% grid integrated. Free2move eSolutions will act as turn-key technology provider and NHOA will develop the network. Approximately, 5,000 fast and ultra-fast charging points should be installed by 2025 and 35,000 by 2030.\n\noutside its value chain:\n\n- supporting the Amazon Forest Carbon Sink Project: since 1998, the PEUGEOT-ONF forest carbon sink project in Mato Grosso, Brazil involves reforesting areas of degraded land and restoring biodiversity while studying the relationship between reforestation and the absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide. More than 604,000 tons of CO\u2082-eq have been sequestered through biomass and soil. Two million trees including more than 50 native species, were reintroduced in a plantation of nearly 2,000 hectares, more than 40 new global species were discovered.\n\n- supporting Tamar Project in Brazil, to protect sea turtles: The Tamar project has been working for over 40 years in the preservation of sea turtles present in several locations along the Brazilian coast. A connection between the Tamar Project and Jeep began in 1982, when the first researchers already used models of the brand, which guaranteed that they could get anywhere, facing the challenges of trails and roads, to collect and release baby turtles into the sea after failing to reach the surface upon leaving the nest. Since early 2018, this Jeep and Tamar Project partnership became a reality with the availability of Jeep 4x4 models for the project.\n\n### 11.4.7 Distribution of added value\n\n| Distributions | Year | (in millions of euros) | (as a % of revenue) |\n|---------------|------|------------------------|---------------------|\n| CapEx + R&D\u00b9  | 2022 | 8,938                  | 5.0                 |\n|               | 2021 | 10,081                 | 6.6                 |\n| Public sector\u00b2| 2022 | 2,729                  | 1.5                 |\n|               | 2021 | 1,911                  | 1.3                 |\n| Employees\u00b3    | 2022 | 18,200                 | 10.1                |\n|               | 2021 | 17,500                 | 11.2                |\n| Shareholders\u2074 | 2022 | 3,353                  | 1.9                 |\n|               | 2021 | 3,765                  | 2.5                 |\n\n\u00b9 Gross R&D Expenses, research tax credit and subsidies excluded.\n\u00b2 Corporate Tax.\n\u00b3 Bonuses and profit sharing included.\n\u2074 Dividends paid to Shareholders.\nDISTRIBUTION OF VALUE CREATED IN 2022\n\n**Customers**\n- 14 iconic brands committed to offering best-in-class fully electrified solutions\n- Two mobility brands offering mobility solutions including subscription programs, carsharing and charging services with 61,304 LEVs in fleet during 2022\n- Affordable maintenance with spare parts from circular economy: close to 60% of vehicle content covered by reused parts offers; cost savings for customers up to 40%\n- Higher level of product quality through 100% of the Stellantis vehicle assembly plants and powertrain plants certified ISO 9001 or IATF 16949\n- 30% reduction in vehicle defect rates\n\n**Employees**\n- Personnel cost: \u20ac18.2 billion\n- Profit sharing: \u20ac2 billion redistributed to employees\n- Training: \u20ac211 million invested delivering about 3.17 million hours of training to approximately 208,535 employees\n- Total lost-time accident frequency rate: 1.25\n- Remote work: up to 70% of work from home for applicable jobs\n- Annual appraisal: 49% of employees\n- Diversity and inclusion: 27% of women in leadership position (L1-L2-L3)\n- 233,015 employees, accounting for 89% of the workforce are covered by collective agreement\n\n**Environment**\n- Investments: \u20ac5.2 billion of R&D costs during 2022 and over \u20ac30 billion total investment planned through 2025 for electrification and software development\n- 2030 Electrification plan: 100% of passenger car models marketed in Europe, and 100% of passenger car and light duty truck models in the U.S., planned to include a full electric version\n- Low Emission Vehicle offering: expanded to 40 electrified models: 48% of passengers car nameplates in Europe and 14% of passengers car and light duty truck nameplates in the U.S.\n- Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) covered 69% of the total fleet sold Vehicles available in Europe are 95% recoverable and 85% recyclable\n- High-Voltage battery recycling rates: 69.3% for Li-ion batteries and 83.8% for NiMH batteries\n- Manufacturing initiatives: control energy consumption led to savings of approximately \u20ac28 million with emission reduction of 123,000 tons of CO\u2082-eq\n- Global BEV sales up 41% year over year\n- Carbon footprint reduced by 14% compared to 2021\n\n**Host communities and civil society**\n- Philanthropy: more than \u20ac19.7 million to support 124 projects focused on education\n- 713 Stellantis employees participated in employee volunteerism program\n- Youth development: 4,378 apprentices and 2,110 interns trained\n- Direct contractual relationship with more than 2,000 Tier 1 direct material suppliers\n\n**Investors and shareholders**\n- Net Revenue: \u20ac179.6 billion\n- \u20ac4.2 billion ordinary dividend\n- Adjusted operating margin: 13.0%\n- Wages to revenue ratio: 10.1%\n- EU Taxonomy Regulation aligned Revenues: 7%, OPEX: 27.5%, CAPEX: 22%\n- Industrial Free cash flow: \u20ac10.8 billion\n- Net profit: \u20ac16.8 billion\n- Synergies: \u20ac71 billion net cash benefit\n\n**Suppliers and partners**\n- Purchase: more than \u20ac98 billion\n- CSR performance: more than 2,974 suppliers assessed by EcoVadis, corresponding to more than 87% of the annual purchased value\n- 1,177 patents applications published\n- Building an innovative and powerful ecosystem with strategic partnerships with notably Automotive Cells Company, Controlled Thermal Resources, Factorial Energy, LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI, Umicore and Vulcan Energy; and collaborations with Amazon, BMW and Foxconn\n- Global innovation ecosystem: more than 160 co-founded projects worldwide with over 1,000 partners\n\n---\n\n1.

Subject to shareholder approval.\n1.2 Material CSR risks and opportunities inherent to the value creation model\n\n1.2.1 CSR MACRO-RISKS AND RELATED CSR ISSUES: STELLANTIS CSR PILLARS AND CHALLENGES\n\nStellantis has identified six CSR macro-risks and addresses them in accordance with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. These six CSR macro risks are the six pillars of Stellantis approach to Corporate Social Responsibility. In light of the Company\u2019s activities, each macro-risk has been broken down into a number of CSR issues, which are material to the Company and its stakeholders. These CSR issues are Stellantis CSR challenges.\n\nCSR risk management approach\n\nGiven its determination to take Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) into account in all its decisions and activities, Stellantis takes the same approach in managing CSR risks as it does for its other risks: the CSR risks are subject to internal control and are specifically included in the Company\u2019s Internal Audit plan.\n\nThe Company\u2019s risks and associated control procedures are described in section 1.2.3 and further detailed in the risk management section of the Annual Report.\n\n1.2.2 STELLANTIS MATERIALITY MATRIX: RELATIVE POSITION OF THE 22 CSR CHALLENGES\n\nFor Stellantis, a material CSR issue is a sustainability factor that can have a present or future impact on the Company\u2019s value drivers, competitive position, and therefore on long-term stakeholder value creation.\n\n22 CSR issues are considered to be material by Stellantis experts and stakeholders, according to two criteria:\n\n- those that reflect the environmental, economic and social impacts of the Company\u2019s activities;\n- those for which the environmental, economic and social contexts in which the Company operates have impact on the Company\u2019s performance.\n\nBased on this double materiality approach, those CSR issues are considered as having a substantive influence on the stakeholders\u2019 assessments and decisions. Hence each CSR issue is a CSR challenge for Stellantis.\n\nThis CSR Report presents a definition, the Stellantis ambition and commitment and the main initiatives and achievements related to each CSR issue / challenge.\n\nThroughout the year Stellantis reviews progress on the CSR issues / challenges and the status is validated by the Top Executive Team and presented to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Company adopts measures proportionate to the position of each CSR issue / challenge in the materiality matrix. These measures are described in this CSR Report.\n### Stellantis CSR macro-risks / pillars and CSR issues / challenges\n\n| 6 CSR MACRO-RISKS / PILLARS | 22 CSR ISSUES / CHALLENGES |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Bringing a tangible impact on climate change | 1.

This materiality assessment allowed us to identify critical economic, environmental and social issues on which we have impacts or which have a significant impact on our business performance and long term value creation. The result was confirmed by a review of issues reported by industry peers and an analysis of worldwide CSR reference and reporting standards.\n\nA representative sample of stakeholders was then interviewed to ascertain their opinion.\n\nThis structured approach enabled to score and position the CSR issues on the matrix:\n\n1. the position of the issue on the horizontal axis represents the importance of the CSR issue for the business performance of the Company, according to three criteria:\n   - likelihood of the threat materializing and opportunities created by the issue\n   - the seriousness of the impact for the Company, quantified in monetary terms by the Division affected, in case of absence of action\n   - impact on long-term performance, in case of absence of action.\n\n2. the position of the issue on the vertical axis represents the importance of the stakeholders\u2019 expectations on the CSR issue, based on their assessment on the impact Stellantis activities have on the environment and the society:\n   - the score given for each issue by the interviewed stakeholders reflects their perception of the impact the Company can have on each issue.\n   - the score is weighted based on the contribution of each stakeholder and their expertise on the issues.\n\nThe materiality matrix is compliant with the double materiality principle that companies should report not only on financially material topics that influence their value, but also on economical, environmental and social impacts that the company have on the society.\n\nAn external provider ensured that each issue was scored strictly and fairly using a rigorous methodology.\n1.2.3 EXTENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF RISKS\n\nThe overall Risk Management System of Stellantis integrates the identification and assessment of climate-related risks. Stellantis uses a group-wide risk analysis framework to assess, manage and report risks, including climate-related physical and transition risks and opportunities. All functions are expected to identify and update the risks inherent to their activities. The principal risks in each function, those which are most critical, are analyzed each half year. The enterprise risk assessment is based on a bottom-up approach beginning with functional areas, and concludes with the review by the responsible Chief Operating Officers. The central Risk Management team consolidates results into a report for review and validation with the Top Executive Team.\n\nStellantis Protection, Audit and Risk Management Department is in charge of assessing the magnitude of the risk as well as the degree of maturity of the risk management measures adopted. The assessment and prioritization process of risks/opportunities, including those posed by climate change, starts with classification of likelihood of the risk occurrence, potential impact on profitability, business continuity and reputation, and mitigation actions in place. These elements determine the residual risk rating defining the risk significance and prioritization for the Company. Risks that are identified as having high- or medium-high rating are considered significant. The top significant risks, those that might have a substantive financial or strategic impact on the business, are deemed \u201cTop Risks\u201d. Each Top Risk is then classified by risk categories (Strategic, Operational, Financial and Compliance) and control measures and mitigating actions are subsequently defined.\n\nResults of the risk assessment are submitted to the Audit Committee, assisting the Board of Directors in their responsibility for strategic oversight of risk management activities. The Audit Committee reviews risk protocols and covers the spectrum of the climate-related physical and transition risks that could have an impact on the Stellantis financial and accounting information. The Board of Directors validates the mapping of Top-Risks.\n\nStellantis\u2019 risk management system includes action plans and quality indicators, which are audited by the Risk Department of the Company.\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) macro risks and issues are also embedded in the Top Risks process through interviews of a significant number of managers and top managers. The relevant actions are reflected in the mitigation plans implemented in operational divisions and included in training programs as needed.\nCSR PILLARS AND THEIR CHALLENGES EMBEDDED IN STELLANTIS

BRINGING A TANGIBLE IMPACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nIn the World Economic Forum \u201c2021 Risk Report\u201d, climate was declared a major and imminent risk to the global economy, having wide environmental impacts, and increasing economic and societal divisions, inside countries and between regions. Companies are key players to introduce solutions and Stellantis is committed to bring a tangible impact on climate change. Stellantis has concerns that the climate emergency may be a threat to the operations of industrial and global companies like ours. Likewise, Stellantis is concerned that if not enough is done to correct the current climate situation, the rise in temperatures might drastically affect the environment including water, air and biodiversity, which may alter the ability to sustain human activities. Challenging dialogues with stakeholders, such as investors, institutions, and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), among others, allow the Company to share its vision of carbon neutrality, its targets, its initiatives and solutions.\n\nMore than ever, to address the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and to meet the challenge of drastically reducing its carbon footprint, Stellantis is rethinking its value creation model to anticipate major trends.\n\nClimate change requires a global response, which for Stellantis includes designing vehicles with lower CO\u2082-eq emissions, reducing the carbon impact of manufacturing facilities, logistics and purchasing and putting measures in place to offset any remaining carbon impact. Stellantis views it as an opportunity to be even more agile to face the challenges and to create the future of mobility, allowing for freedom of movement with reduced or no carbon emissions.\n\nTo demonstrate its tangible commitments for a low-carbon economy, Stellantis strengthened its climate governance by having climate change concern embedded in its decision-making processes and developed a holistic and offensive strategy with the goal to reduce CO\u2082-eq emissions across its entire value chain.\n\nStellantis also considers that growing awareness about upcoming climate changes for each and every individual is of the utmost importance. In this respect, Stellantis is providing a free and easy access to a web-based Climate School with more than ten hours of training to its employees, in order for them to better understand the stakes and to get prepared for the necessary sustainable transformation of their activity. As of end 2022, more than 7,300 cumulated hours of training have been taken.\n\n2.1 Context and Stellantis position\n\nStellantis has a holistic approach to climate change. Given its main sources of greenhouse gas emissions, the Stellantis decarbonization strategy is threefold:\n\n1. Cutting CO\u2082 vehicle emissions\n2. Moving forward into a carbon-efficient production system\n3. Improving the environmental performance of the supply chain\n\nThe subsequent sections of this Climate Report detail the strategy implemented by Stellantis including the governance and actions to achieve the targets, following the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\nCSR issue/challenge #1: Vehicle CO\u2082 emissions\n\nBased on an assessment of more than 14,000 scientific publications, the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) 2021 report on the physical science of climate change demonstrates that human activities have warmed our planet\u2019s atmosphere faster than anything people have experienced for at least 2000 years.\n\nThe report also answers important questions about how greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants are changing our climate. It sheds light on how plants, soil and the oceans store and release carbon, how the global climate is responding to human influence, and what we may fear about increasing global warming: a water cycle of increasingly variable, lasting changes in ocean and sea levels caused by the melting of frozen spaces on the planet, and more generally, extreme weather and climate events.\n\nBy highlighting the way future human activities change, our climate will affect the planet and its habitants. This report also highlights the importance of the choices we all make today. The recommendations from the IPCC report should be taken into account while implementing our strategies.\n\nIn its Vision 2050 report published in 2020, the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) projected that CO\u2082-eq emissions from transportation would rise from 10.9 Gt in 2015 to 11.9 Gt in 2019\u20132022. Forty-six percent of those global transportation CO\u2082 emissions come from the four largest vehicle markets: U.S., China, EU and India.\n\nOur industry has a role in the global effort to limit the rise of temperatures to 1.5 degrees. To achieve this effort, Stellantis is adapting its business model and launching new technologies in order to meet its milestones and objectives while satisfying consumer demands for improved fuel economy and lower CO\u2082-eq emissions in several markets. Our success depends on our ability to meet regulatory emissions requirements while at the same time seek to meet customer expectations for access to safe, sustainable and affordable mobility solutions. The electrification of vehicles is one of the key actions by which we are supporting the transition to a decarbonized economy while working toward carbon neutrality.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nStellantis believes it has an ethical responsibility to offer customers affordable mobility solutions that are sustainable for the planet and its citizens.\n\nStellantis is determined to be compliant with applicable GHG regulations around the globe. This has been demonstrated since the creation of Stellantis with a fast-growing LEV line-up and sales mix, aiming at an ambitious position in the industry in terms of low CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nThis determination has been further strengthened through its Dare Forward 2030 plan published on March 1, 2022, which includes an accelerated roll-out of BEVs worldwide and the target of reducing by 2030 its global carbon footprint by 50% tons CO\u2082 eq/veh versus 2021, on the path to its commitment to achieve carbon net zero in 2038 with a single-digit percent compensation.\nStellantis believes that the renewed global ambitions to tackle climate change, including the Paris Agreement and the EU and U.S. objectives for carbon neutrality by 2050, could be achieved if the ecosystem adapts. Transition to low CO\u2082 transport and mobility at an increased pace requires policy makers to develop and implement a carefully coordinated plan that takes into account the countervailing economic and social challenges associated with this rapid transition. It also requires public authorities to actively support the development of an affordable and sustainable mobility ecosystem through the wise use of the regulatory framework and financial tools and by ensuring the contribution of all sectors and green energy sources of all kinds - in particular the energy sector that should provide green electricity. The availability of a convenient and widespread vehicle recharging and fast charging infrastructure will play a crucial role and must be facilitated.\n\n**CSR issue/challenge #2: Industrial and site carbon footprint**\n\nAlthough the emissions associated with fuel and electricity consumption in our manufacturing and other facilities represents a small part, around 1%, of the Company\u2019s overall carbon footprint, we are committed to reducing carbon emissions from industrial operations and non-manufacturing facilities. We regard this effort as an important factor in tackling climate change. As far as vehicle manufacturing is concerned, the major cause of greenhouse gas emissions is energy consumption. To reduce our impact on climate, Stellantis acts on several levers such as optimizing the energy efficiency of manufacturing processes, using electricity derived from carbon-free renewable sources and adopting more efficient technologies.\n\n**Company\u2019s public position**\n\nAt Stellantis, we are committed to contributing to a decarbonized economy by engaging our talented teams and assets on the road to the world carbon neutrality. The Company has been rolling out a process for controlling its environmental impact and ensuring continuous improvement. Based on our experience (vast majority of our plants are, or are becoming ISO 14001-certified, and the environmental footprint of its manufacturing operations being progressively reduced); we are convinced that the energy transition requires that all actors of the economic ecosystem join forces. Manufacturing companies need to find affordable and available carbon free energy sources to implement their decarbonization pathway. We also believe solutions need to continue to be found or consolidated: we encourage governments to support research and development efforts related to carbon capture and storage technologies that should contribute to decarbonization.\n\n**CSR issue/challenge #3: Carbon footprint of the supply chain: purchasing and logistics**\n\nIn addition to emissions from vehicles and manufacturing, there are significant emissions that come from outside the organization. These additional emissions are connected with our activities. The CO\u2082 emissions related to the purchase of goods for use in our products represents more than 10% of the overall European carbon footprint of the Company while inbound and outbound transportation accounts for about 1%.\nWe are committed to contributing to a decarbonized economy by following the principles of the Paris Agreement. We engage in this journey with our supply base to support our leadership in clean and advanced technologies for mobility solutions. We also ask them to commit to the same objectives of reducing their impact on the climate.\n\nStellantis works to reduce the CO\u2082 emissions associated with logistics as the environmental impact of inbound and outbound transportation is far-reaching, ranging from local impact, such as sound, air pollution, etc., to global warming. The challenge is to optimize transport plans, loads and volumes and the use of multimodal transport.\n\n**Company\u2019s public position**\n\nStellantis supports the decarbonization development of suppliers in the automotive industry. This goal is determined as one of the strategic drivers in the partnership with our suppliers, driven by the fact that decarbonization will be a key factor of competitiveness and long-term commitment between Stellantis and its supply base. Therefore, we tackle this goal with several activities in our direct relationship with our supply base. Together with our suppliers, we aim to reduce CO\u2082 emissions in the supply chain through for example, the design and development of parts and services, increasing the usage of recycled material and recyclability. The monitoring of CO\u2082 emissions of our suppliers is supported by various external partners, like the CDP Supply Chain Module and EcoVadis.\n\nWe are also engaged in several organized initiatives. These include local and wider scale initiatives of the automotive industry, amongst them several in Europe and North America at a national (PFA; AIAG; VDA; ANFIA) and regional level (by the ARIAs, automotive competitiveness clusters, regional automotive industry associations; ACEA) with public authorities and the administration.\n\nThe Global Purchasing and Supply Chain Division supplements this automotive industry network and its ecosystem by appointing regional leadership in each manufacturing cluster around the world.\n\nStellantis supports both carbon net zero objectives as well as the need for a level environmental playing field.\n\nIn the area of transport and logistics Stellantis urges public authorities to increase and improve multimodal transport solutions as this could provide a low carbon intensive access to and from Stellantis facilities worldwide. With regard to road transport Stellantis welcomes policies and innovative solutions supporting efficient use of roads, e.g., high-capacity transport such as giga-liners, enabling freight transport to reduce GHG emissions. A rapid deployment of charging and refueling infrastructure for alternatively powered heavy duty vehicles is essential to reducing CO\u2082 emissions in road transport.\n### 2.2 Forward-looking Climate vision and targets\n\n| CSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE | VISION/AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | RESULTS |\n|----------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|---------|\n| **Carbon footprint reduction in the whole value chain**<br>Owner: Chief Planning Officer | Contribute to a global carbon neutrality, with an ambitious carbon footprint reduction roadmap | GHG emissions reduction (%): absolute GWP in scope 1 and 2, intensity GWP (per veh) for scope 3 -1.5\u00b0C scenario - Global | Short-term: 2023 targets for vehicle programs under development consistent with -50% 2030 objective | 2022: 2023 targets for vehicle programs under development consistent with -50% 2030 objective |\n| **Vehicle CO\u2082 emissions**<br>Owner: Chief Planning Officer | Propose a wide range of Low Carbon mobility devices, rapidly available in countries of operations, to contribute to the race to carbon neutrality, by leading CO\u2082 emissions reduction | Percentage of nameplates with LEV offering (focus on U.S. and EU) | 2025: EU Passenger Cars (PC): 96% U.S. PC & Light Duty Trucks (LDT): 91% | 2022: EU PC: 48% LEV (14% BEV) U.S. PC & LDT: 14% LEV |\n| **Industrial and sites carbon footprint**<br>Owner: Chief Manufacturing Officer | Contribute to a decarbonized economy by achieving net zero emissions within our activities worldwide (scope 1 and 2) | Absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (tons of CO\u2082-eq) | 2025: -50% vs 2021 | 2022: 2023 targets for vehicle programs under development consistent with -50% 2030 objective |\n| **Carbon footprint of the supply chain: purchasing and logistics**<br>Owner: Chief Purchasing & Supply Chain Officer | Request our suppliers and their supply base by reaching into them on a cascading basis, therein to support our road to carbon neutrality by bringing innovative solutions and by adopting own GHG emissions reduction trajectories to comply or outreach the Paris Climate Agreement | (1) Share of Annual Purchased Value from suppliers with CO\u2082 reduction targets compliant with the Paris Agreement (2) CO\u2082 emissions of purchased parts | 2025: (1) 80% Annual Purchase Value from strategic (Level 1 and Level 2) suppliers (2) Award business compliant with CO\u2082 emission targets defined for each new EV project | 2022: More than 65% of strategic (Level 1 and Level 2) suppliers committed to comply with the Paris Agreement |\n\n1. The achievement is conditioned by key external enablers: decarbonized energy (based on Announced Pledges Scenario from International Energy Agency), and conducive public policies for BEV (charging infrastructure, purchasing incentives)\nA net zero commitment to support the planet\u2019s carbon neutrality\n\nStellantis targets to become carbon net zero on the whole value chain by 2038, with single digit percent compensation of residual emissions versus 2021 level.\n\n**STELLANTIS CARBON NET-ZERO ROADMAP**\n\n- **2021**\n  - Base year\n\n- **2025**\n  - -50%* tCO\u2082 eq/veh\n  - Across our entire value chain\n  - 50% decarbonized electricity used\n\n- **2030**\n  - -75%* tCO\u2082 absolute\n  - 100% decarbonized electricity used\n\n- **2038**\n  - CARBON NET ZERO with single digit % compensation\n  - More than -90%* tCO\u2082 eq/veh\n  - Across our entire value chain\n  - Compensation of all residual emissions\n\n**Key external enablers for this roadmap are:**\n- Decarbonized energy (based on Announced Pledges Scenario from International Energy Agency)\n- Conductive public policies for BEV (charging infrastructure, purchasing incentives)\n\n* Reduction vs 2021 base year\nIn order to contribute to the collective global carbon neutrality objective in the most efficient way, Stellantis strategy is based on energy consumption reduction first, then carbon footprint reduction at the maximum, before balancing residual GHG emissions with carbon removal and additional other compensation solutions if relevant.\n\nTo achieve this target, Stellantis has defined a comprehensive, long-term, carbon net zero roadmap, including an intermediate target of -50% reduction by 2030 versus 2021, based on the following key milestones:\n\n- by 2030, Stellantis targets to reduce GHG emissions by -75% on industrial sites and real estate (scope 1 and 2 of GHG protocol) and to use 100% of decarbonized electricity;\n- Stellantis continues to reduce the Well-to-Wheel CO\u2082 emissions of its vehicles, due to electrification roadmap, improvement of BEV efficiencies and fuel consumption of remaining ICE vehicles (scope 3 Use of sold products of GHG protocol). By 2030, Stellantis intends to sell 100% BEV for passenger cars in Europe and 50% BEV for passenger cars and light-duty trucks in the U.S.;\n- Stellantis has actively engaged with its suppliers to reduce the carbon footprint of purchased parts, especially led by an objective of cutting by 40% the carbon footprint of purchased parts of BEV by 2030 (scope 3 Purchased goods and services of GHG protocol). This will allow to keep under control the share of carbon footprint of battery and components production in the context of a global footprint reduction thanks to electrification.\n\nThese objectives can be reached under the condition that the ecosystem adapts at the right pace and is conducive to electrification (public policies, charging infrastructure, decarbonized electricity, etc.).\n\nConsidering regulatory orientations are still pending on carbon removal questions, Stellantis has engaged an in-depth screening of mature and emerging technologies - including Spot Source Capture, Direct Air/Ocean Capture, Bio Capture and Storage, Mineral Storage, etc. - to assess the most reliable and impactful carbon removal and storage technologies.\n\nKey orientations on this topic are planned to be submitted to the Strategy Council consistently with the timeline of decisions to be made for the Stellantis carbon net zero roadmap.\nStellantis is computing its carbon footprint in accordance with Green House Gas Protocol and consistently with ISO 14064 standard. Targets - covering absolute GHG emissions from scopes 1 and 2 and Well-to-Wheel CO2 emissions from scope 3 in intensity - are established referring to the available Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) methodology at the time of roadmap definition, based on Sector Decarbonization Approach for the transport sector. The 2030 intermediate targets are in line with the Paris Agreement and 1.5\u00b0C scenario.\n\nConsistency of Stellantis approach with SBTi recommendations has been verified by EcoAct in 2022, a specialized firm in environmental analysis and greenhouse gas diagnostics.\n\nThe targets are defined assuming no change in the lifetime mileage of vehicles over the years, nevertheless, we will also work on the improvement of the durability of our vehicles.\n\nImpacts on other environmental criteria of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) are also taken into consideration.\n\n### 2.3 Identification and management of climate risks and opportunities\n\nThe automobile industry is facing profound economic, regulatory, environmental and societal challenges, driven by the fight against climate change. This translates into increasing pressure from all stakeholders (financial players, customers, regulators, civil society, NGOs and suppliers). In this context, the identification and the management of climate-related risks and opportunities is a key approach for Stellantis to work towards business sustainability.\n\nManaging those risks and opportunities leads Stellantis to define a clear decarbonization strategy, ambitious objectives and efficient enablers.\n\nGiven its determination to embed CSR in its decisions and activities, climate risks are managed by specific strategic actions and resources within the area of expertise required. Risk management is integrated at the heart of the strategy across the organization, from the decision-making bodies to the operational entities.\nClimate leadership of Stellantis: ambition and strategy\n\n**CLIMATE CHANGE RISK AND OPPORTUNITIES**\n\n**OUR IDENTIFIED CLIMATE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES**\n\n**TRANSITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES**\n- New Mobility\n- Innovation\n- Resource efficiency\n- Vehicle complexity\n- Vertical Integration\n\n**RISKS**\n- Policy and legal\n- Technology\n- Market\n\n**Physical**\n- Social\n- Reputation\n- Supply chain\n- Facilities\n- Scarcity\n\n**OUR VISION FOR CLIMATE**\n\nContribute to a global carbon neutrality, with an ambitious carbon footprint reduction roadmap\n\n**OUR CLIMATE STRATEGY**\n- Innovation breakthroughs for low-carbon technologies\n- Strategic partnerships to master the EV value chain\n- New mobility solutions expansion\n- Close collaboration and innovation with stakeholders across the supply chain (purchasing and logistics)\n- Carbon / energy-efficient and resilient production assets (Stellantis Production Way roadmap)\n\n**OUR OBJECTIVES FOR 2038**\n- Carbon net zero of the whole value chain (scope 1, 2 and 3) with single digit % compensation of residual emissions versus 2021 level\n- 100% nameplates with BEV offering in Europe** and U.S.***\n- 100% BEV sales in Europe** and 100% BEV sales in U.S.***\n- Carbon net zero of the supply chain with minimal compensation\n- Absolute greenhouse gas emissions reduced by more than 90% for scope 1 and 2\n\n**OUR ENABLERS**\n- Efficient governance with clear responsibilities\n- Solid climate-related risk management with scenario analysis\n- Transparent climate monitoring with ambitious metrics and targets\n- Focused research and development/innovation investments\n- Continuous workforce skill improvement policy\n- Benchmark and sharing best practices to improve overall consumption by plants\n\n* Commitments, targets and conditions are detailed in 2.2\n** For passenger cars\n*** For passenger cars and light-duty trucks\nCarbon footprint\n\nIn order to manage its carbon footprint, Stellantis annually quantifies the total CO\u2082 equivalent of greenhouse gases, primarily CO\u2082, emitted from its activities over the whole life cycle of its automotive products, taking into account its global activity and the real-life emissions of the vehicles.\n\nThe table below sums up the assessment of global Stellantis emissions of CO\u2082 equivalent from 2021, first year of operation of Stellantis.\n\n**Global Stellantis carbon footprint**\n\n| Scope 1 (million tons CO\u2082-eq) | 2022 | 2021 |\n|------------------------------|------|------|\n|                              | 1.5  | 1.7  |\n\n| Scope 2* (million tons CO\u2082-eq) | 2022 | 2021 |\n|-------------------------------|------|------|\n|                               | 1.9  | 2.2  |\n\n| Scope 3 (million tons CO\u2082-eq) | 2022 | 2021 |\n|-------------------------------|------|------|\n|                               | 447.2| 523.3|\n\n| Total emissions (million tons CO\u2082-eq) | 2022 | 2021 |\n|---------------------------------------|------|------|\n|                                       | 450.6| 527.2|\n\n*market-based\n\n2022 global carbon footprint has reduced by 14.5% in absolute -

all component materials of vehicles manufactured in 2022 from extraction to molding and assembly on the vehicle, using life cycle analysis databases\n  - the upstream transport\n  - the work-related travel air trips\n  - Car trips being made with company cars are accounted through the use of Stellantis vehicles in Scope 3 downstream activities.\n\nFor Detailed comparison of 2022 and 2021 emission items refer to 2.5.4.3\n\nFor more information refer to 2.7\nCOMPANY ACTIVITIES include energy consumption in:\n- manufacturing plants (assembly plants or components factories)\n- tertiary sites\n- dealership networks\n\nThey are derived from GHG (greenhouse gas) assessments carried out at Stellantis plants, tertiary sites and Company-owned dealership network.\n\nDOWNSTREAM ACTIVITIES including:\n- Tank-to-Wheel CO\u2082 emissions: use of vehicles sold in 2022 according to the CO\u2082 emissions data for each vehicle sold and the following operating criteria:\n  - Mileage\n    - For North America: 225,865 miles (363,643 km) for Passenger Cars and Light Duty Trucks, and 150,000 miles (241,500 km) for Heavy Duty Trucks over 15 years, consistent with EPA Green House Gas regulation\n    - For Europe and other regions: 50,000 km for micromobility devices, 225,000 km for Passenger Cars and 300,000 km for Light Commercial vehicles over 15 years\n  - Real-life consumption assumptions based on regional monitoring, notably for ICE vehicles: +20% against WLTP regulatory CO\u2082 emission value for Europe and +30% against unadjusted EPA fuel Consumption (consistent with EPA label value) for North America\n- Well-to-Tank CO\u2082 emissions, corresponding to the impact of the production of:\n  - the fuels used by conventional vehicles, evaluated using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) databases;\n  - the electricity used by the electrified vehicles, evaluated based on actuals and forecasts from LCA databases and International Energy Agency scenarios per region\n  - the production of spare parts used for the maintenance of the cars, using LCA databases\n  - the vehicle end-of-life modelled on current processes\n  - the downstream transport.\n\nOther subcategories of GHG protocol (such as employee commuting, waste generated in operations, etc.) \u2013 have an impact of less than 1% according to our first assessment. A detailed analysis is on-going on those activities as well as on emissions from purchased services. These activities are not captured in the 2021 & 2022 disclosure.\n2.3.1 CLIMATE RELATED RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION AND ACROSS THE VALUE CHAIN\n\nOn the Stellantis materiality matrix, climate change appears as one of the top macro-risks the Company has to tackle. It requires a global and comprehensive response supporting the attainment of our carbon-neutrality target in the long-term as well as our intermediate targets in the short- to medium-term. A clear and transparent acknowledgement of the risks and issues related to climate change is therefore vital for Stellantis to work towards sustainability.\n\n2.3.1.1 Extensive assessment of climate risks\n\nAs part of its Risk Management System, Stellantis uses its company-wide risk analysis framework to assess, manage and report climate-related physical and transition risks and opportunities. Given their potential impact on the Company\u2019s situation, the two climate-related risks, \u2018natural hazards\u2019 and \u2018global carbon footprint\u2019, are considered as top risks and presented to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\n2.3.1.2 Sowing the seeds of the carbon-neutral future opens new business opportunities\n\nIn accordance with the TCFD recommendations, our climate-related risk assessment sorts risks into two categories: transition risks and physical risks. The assessment of transition climate-related risks considers risks related to the current and emerging regulation, technology risks, legal risks, market risks and reputation risks. As for the assessment of physical climate-related risks, it considers both acute risks from extreme weather conditions such as floods or wildfires and chronic risks such as impacts of rising temperatures and accelerating loss of biodiversity.\n\nWhile the climate crisis generates transition and physical risks, Stellantis also considers it as an opportunity. The Company\u2019s agility enables it to focus on the most relevant market stakes and to rapidly implement decisions made to adapt to evolving mobility expectations. New \u201clow-carbon\u201d mobility solutions and urban mobility markets are becoming significant sources of revenue. Along with operational efficiency and technological innovation, they enhance the leadership and value of Stellantis.\n\nThe process used to assess and manage climate-related opportunities is identical to the one used to manage climate-related risks, in the sense that they are embedded within the Company\u2019s business lines, with entities managing specific climate issues that are within their area of expertise.\n### RISK #1: MORE STRINGENT CO\u2082 EMISSIONS REGULATIONS THRESHOLDS FOR VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS\n\n**Type of risk:** Transition Risk: Policy & Legal  \n**Timeframe:** Short-term (until 2025)\n\n| Risk | Opportunities |\n|------|---------------|\n| **RISK DESCRIPTION** | **MITIGATION STRATEGY**  \nThe number, scope and ambition of regulatory requirements regarding greenhouse gas emissions are expected to increase significantly in the future. This concerns vehicle fuel efficiency regulations and emissions standards as well as regulations that apply to Stellantis\u2019 production facilities and to most of its suppliers. A failure to comply may lead to fines, vehicle recalls, the suspension of sales and may adversely affect Stellantis\u2019 reputation. Stellantis takes this risk into account because the Company sells vehicles in countries where regulations on fuel consumption are severe.  \n**POTENTIAL IMPACT**  \nMost of CO\u2082-related regulations worldwide include fines payment clause in case of noncompliance - see examples of assessment for Stellantis below the table. Stellantis must devote financial and management resources, vehicle engineering and design attention, to these legal requirements. Emissions standards applying to production facilities may require investments to upgrade facilities, thus increasing operating costs. Because these regulations drive investors to monitor the carbon intensity of their asset portfolios, a failure to comply may have risk profile impacts and increase credit costs. A failure by suppliers to meet applicable environmental laws or regulations may lead to a disruption of Stellantis\u2019 supply chain or to raw materials and components price increases\u00b2.  \n**ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES**  \nReducing vehicle complexity. Focusing on development of environmentally friendly technologies that can be rolled out on a large scale, allow product design simplification as well as purchasing and manufacturing optimization (footprint, logistics, inventories, etc.). This is a strong enabler for Stellantis powertrain and vehicle complexity reduction.  \nAssociating suppliers to decarbonized energy. Using CO\u2082-eq \u201ccradle-to-gate\u201d performance as a criterion for the business award and requesting key suppliers to commit to CO\u2082 reduction trajectory compliant with Paris Agreement brings a significant improvement to Stellantis environmental targets achievement.  \nIncreasing business attractiveness. Stellantis considers complying with European Taxonomy regulation by properly disclosing the share of Taxonomy-aligned turnover and expenditures (capital and operational) will provide several opportunities, such as demonstrating to customers, media and financial markets our incremental contribution to sustainable mobility and confirming our attractiveness as taxonomy will allow comparison between companies of the same sector regarding their share of Taxonomy-aligned activities. The Company will have access to new financial instruments at favorable conditions, such as EU Green bonds. |\n\n\u00b2If no CO\u2082 improvements were brought to 2022 Passenger Cars European fleet, disregarding the benefit of eco-innovation technologies, the theoretical fine incurred in 2025 would be close to \u20ac1.3 billion (average 105.5g versus 98g estimated 2025 Stellantis target * 1.8 million vehicles * \u20ac95/g) - according to regulation UE 2019/631; In US, considering only NHTSA CAFE regulation for Light Duty Fleet, disregarding any credits banking and off-cycle technology benefit, the theoretical fine incurred in 2025 for a fleet with the same performance as in 2021 would be close to $2.5 Billion (average 28mpg vs 38mpg estimated 2025 Stellantis target * 1.7 million vehicles * $15 per 0.1mpg) - according to regulations 49 CFR 531, 49 CFR 533 (Targets) and 49 CFR 578.6 (h) (2) (Penalties)\n## RISK #2: IMPACTS ON THE BUSINESS MODEL OF THE TRANSITION TO LOW CARBON TECHNOLOGIES\n\n**Type of risk:** Transition Risk: Technological  \n**Timeframe:** Short-term (until 2025)\n\n| Risk | Opportunities |\n|------|---------------|\n| **RISK DESCRIPTION** | **MITIGATION STRATEGY** | **ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES** |\n| The registration of LEVs is increasing sharply and is expected to keep growing. | Speeding up the electrification of the car line in all segments. Stellantis aims to over perform the market with its LEV sales, anticipating LEV pricing improvements due to a reduced Total Cost of Ownership.  \nRefer to section 2.5.3.2 | Selling highly efficient LEVs to gain a competitive advantage. Increased battery longevity and efficiency would increase EV range and, in turn, the demand for these vehicles.  \nRefer to section 2.5.3.2.4 |\n| **POTENTIAL IMPACT** | Gaining control over EV components supply chain to maintain the value added.  \nRefer to section 2.5.3.2.2 | Selling batteries to third parties. Our vertical integration strategy provides us with the opportunity to sell batteries to other automobile manufacturers and therefore generate additional revenue.  \nPlacing a Zero-emission hydrogen fuel cell offer complementary to the battery-electric solutions.  \nRefer to section 2.5.2 |\n| The transition to low carbon technologies may lead to an increase in vehicle price and have a negative impact on the demand addressed by the company\u2019s products, especially if government subsidies for EV sales are not maintained. Manufacturers may not be able to generate profit from LEV sales as anticipated since competitive pricing might be used in order to win market share, while adversely affecting profits. Technological capabilities may prove short-lived if BEVs replace PHEVs sooner than expected. After-sales revenue may also be impacted as EVs require less maintenance than ICE vehicles. The transition to LEVs could create a loss of added value if carmakers fail to obtain expertise in electrified technologies. Since EV manufacturing reduces the number of workers needed per vehicle produced, increased LEV sales could impact workforce volume. However, eventual delays in the development of new technology for electrification may result in the loss of revenue and market shares. The inability to keep up with the market\u2019s electrification trends would prevent the Company from complying with CAFE regulations. | Optimizing battery cost. The Battery Management System aims to maximize the useful energy in real life, and controlling the aging to postpone discharge as much as possible.  \nAnticipating the impacts of the Company\u2019s decarbonization strategy on its workers, in a \u201cjust transition approach\u201d Stellantis boosts its workers\u2019 employability through training programs. The powertrain and gearbox industrial strategy is often on the agenda of employee representative bodies meetings.  \nRefer to section 3.1.4 and 3.2.7 | Launching a fast charging network across Europe to encourage EV adoption by supporting the EV ecosystem.  \nRefer to section 2.5.3.2.3 |\n### RISK #3: INSUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF CRITICAL RAW MATERIALS TO SATISFY THE PRODUCTION NEEDS RELATED TO LEVS\n\n**Type of risk:** Transition Risk: Market  \n**Timeframe:** Short-term (until 2025)\n\n| Risk | MITIGATION STRATEGY | Opportunities |\n|------|---------------------|--------------|\n| **RISK DESCRIPTION** | Implementing battery circular economy solutions to reduce automobile manufacturers\u2019 pressure on scarce raw materials.  \nRefer to section 6.1.7.7 | **ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES**  \nPlanning dual chemistry battery strategy and solid-state batteries.  \nFrom 2024 dual chemistry strategy based on two cobalt free batteries to relieve EVs of raw materials concerns.  \nJoint development agreement signed with Factorial Energy to become a significant player in the solid-state batteries market in 2026.  \nRefer to section 2.5.3.2.4 |  \nRelying on alternative sourcing. Stellantis promotes the materials coming from recycling supply chains. Engineering resources are dedicated to increasing their rate in the production of vehicles.  \nRefer to section 6.1.7.2 |  \nReducing CO\u2082 emissions in the supply chain. Resource efficiency is an opportunity to combine competitiveness and climate change mitigation. Reducing the consumption of raw materials is a win-win situation: it reduces the purchases expenditures as well as the carbon footprint.  \nRefer to section 2.7 |  \nThe life cycle assessment will enhance the visibility on lower tier down to the raw material producer |\n\n**POTENTIAL IMPACT**  \nIncreased market power of raw materials and batteries suppliers may negatively impact Stellantis\u2019 ability to negotiate with its suppliers and may provoke raw material inflation. Price increases would increase Stellantis\u2019 operating costs and could reduce profitability. If the increased costs are passed through to customers via higher vehicles prices, the demand addressed to the products sold by Stellantis might decrease. Certain raw materials needed in lithium-ion batteries are sourced from a limited number of suppliers and countries. These may be susceptible to supply shortages or disruptions. Their sourcing may also cause negative environmental or social impacts. The global demand and supply of a single part could have huge impacts on our production. If Stellantis fails to optimize the raw materials and components used in its manufacturing processes, it may face increased production costs.\n### RISK #4: CHANGING MOBILITY MARKET DUE TO SHIFTS IN CUSTOMER PREFERENCES\n\n**Type of risk:** Transition Risk: Market  \n**Timeframe:** Medium-term (2026-2035)\n\n| Risk | Opportunities |\n|------|---------------|\n| **RISK DESCRIPTION** | **MITIGATION STRATEGY**  \nThe automotive industry is facing disruptive trends that range from the emergence of the mobility services market to the acceleration of new technologies such as the autonomous vehicle. Automotive markets are shifting from vehicle ownership to shared mobility services that change the use of the vehicle fleet. More environmentally conscious consumers turn to product-service systems that encourage the collaborative consumption of goods and services. In some areas of the world, consumers are more reluctant to buy new vehicles and would rather look for shared mobility services. The risk for Stellantis is insufficient adaptation of its business model to new forms of mobility. | Developing a portfolio of mobility services to prevent any gap between the market and Stellantis\u2019 business strategy. Free2move and Leasys aim to compete with other actors, in and out of the automotive sector, on subscription economy trends. They represent opportunities for Stellantis to increase its revenue and gain market share outside of its traditional segments.  \nRefer to section 4.1.7 |\n| **POTENTIAL IMPACT** | **ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES**  \nAs new forms of mobility gain consumer acceptance, vehicle sales may decrease in some markets. The loss of revenue could affect profitability, lead to asset impairment and a fall in their securities valuation. The mobility service market may negatively affect the strength of Stellantis\u2019 brands: new mobility services make it harder to differentiate a company\u2019s products from those of its competitors and therefore harder to encourage customer loyalty. | Pursuing revolutionary autonomous driving projects as part of a multi-partner strategy. While tech players and start-ups should play an important role in the development of the autonomous vehicle market, it also represents a huge opportunity for traditional automakers who manage to launch innovative high technology projects.  \nRefer to section 4.1.7 |\n### RISK #5: INCREASED FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS AND WATER SHORTAGES\n\n**Type of risk:** Physical Risk: Acute  \n**Timeframe:** Medium-term (2026-2035)\n\n| Risk | Opportunities | ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES |\n|------|---------------|--------------------------|\n| **RISK DESCRIPTION** | | Reusing effluents for industrial use. Stellantis filters flushing water from the paint pre-treatment process and water from reverse osmosis to reuse them as industrial water.  \nRefer to section 6.3 |\n| Science shows that extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense, that incremental climatic changes are very likely to happen, and that their impacts are expected to grow more severe over the coming years and decades. The impacts of physical risks are uncertain, in probability, magnitude and timing. Water shortages represent a direct risk for Stellantis since its manufacturing sites use water for production processes. In 2022, 35 plants were located in a high water-stressed area (according to the World Resources Institute\u2019s Aqueduct \u201cbaseline water stress\u201d indicator). These sites represent 32% of the Company\u2019s production volume. | | |\n| **POTENTIAL IMPACT** | | |\n| Stellantis\u2019 production facilities and supply chain are subject to risks related to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes and other climatic phenomena. Any catastrophic loss or significant damage to any of its facilities would likely disrupt Stellantis\u2019 operations, delay production and adversely affect its product development schedules and shipments and lead to a loss of revenue. Our suppliers and the entire extended supply network is also vulnerable to these same disruptive impacts, potentially leading to disruption in the supply of parts for Stellantis. The occurrence of a major incident at a single manufacturing site could compromise the production and sale of several hundred thousand vehicles. Any such loss or significant damage could result in expense to repair or replace the facility. Physical climate-related risks could also have an impact on the cost of insurance. Conflicts of use in water stressed areas could have significant repercussions, notably economic and social impacts that would change the company\u2019s relations with some of its stakeholders.

The higher the climate sensitivity is, the more the climate risks affect Stellantis activities for those same CSR issues. For each issue, Stellantis adopts measures proportionate to its position in the materiality matrix and its sensitivity to climate.\n\nFor more information refer to 6.2.3\n2.3.1.3 A specific management of physical climate risks\n\nIdentifying and assessing the medium-, and long-term evolution of climate changes in terms of frequency and severity are key for Stellantis to build appropriate adaptation plans, manage the related financial impacts and mitigate the risks. In its global risk assessment, Stellantis evaluates the physical risks on its owned sites as well as in its supply chain. Indeed, extreme weather events or natural disasters could damage production facilities owned by Stellantis and its suppliers\u2019 sites, disrupting production and leading to costly delivery delays to the end customer, or resulting in plant repair costs.\n\nFor its own operations, Stellantis has implemented assertive industrial risk prevention strategies designed to:\n\n- prevent the occurrence of major incidents;\n- limit and control high-risk situations;\n- enable the various Stellantis structures to deal with emergency and crisis situations;\n- promote a risk prevention culture;\n- and optimize the transfer to the insurance market of high frequency risks.\n\nStellantis sites build and update plans for continuity and recovery of operations according to exposure to the risks and criticality to the business. To evaluate the physical risks of Stellantis sites, the Company insurance partners use natural disaster risk analyses from insurance databases, such as NatCatService from Munich RE. They monitor and analyze the number of past geophysical, meteorological, hydrological and climatological events and their related financial losses. They also project future occurrences of natural disasters and their potential physical impacts.\n\nBased on this data, Stellantis evaluates the probability of future impacts due to earthquakes, flooding, storms and hurricanes on all its sites. This methodology was applied globally to 120 sites worldwide. As flood events are among the most relevant natural hazards that could affect Stellantis sites, a specific flood risk assessment study was done on the sites that were potentially exposed to a higher flood risk across the regions. The sites also continue to develop prevention plans based on those analyses with the adapted protocols, whereby investment requests regarding risk management are presented. In addition to the induced extreme climatic phenomena such as natural disasters, Company insurance partners also provide risk analyses regarding the direct consequences of the increase in temperature on Stellantis locations. In 2022, a specific assessment based on the RCP 8.5 scenario identified the Stellantis locations the most prone to temporary closure due to heatwaves, triggering business interruption and related loss.\n\nIn its global risk assessment, Stellantis not only evaluates the physical risks on its owned sites, but also in its supply chain. The strategy to manage physical climate-related risks along the supply chain begins with a simplified, semi-quantitative approach used to prioritize suppliers, which helps focus on those crucial suppliers with the greatest potential impact or loss likelihood to Stellantis supply chains. A second step entails a methodology and supporting tool that allows Stellantis to assign a risk management maturity index to the supplier risk management processes.\nThe final step is to work with specialized third-party risk research and development advisors to identify and quantify risks that could impact the supply of components to Stellantis and develop adequate action plans to mitigate those risks. In terms of supplier selection processes, climate-related physical risks analyses based on the same tools are also used on suppliers\u2019 sites based on their GPS coordinates. Stellantis is therefore able to identify the most resilient supply chain options and associated suppliers. Another way to manage climate-related physical risks in the supply chain is to support the increase in the recycling rates of critical raw materials and favor the integration of recycled material in our vehicles which also reduces the Company\u2019s dependence on raw materials supplies.\n\n2.3.2 RESILIENCE STRATEGY BUILT WITH CLIMATE-RELATED SCENARIOS\n\nIn order to assess the impacts of both transition and physical climate-related risks in its strategy and planning and thus to build an effective resilience strategy, Stellantis takes into account how these risks could potentially evolve and what their implications might be. Indeed, most impacts of climate change are likely to affect Stellantis\u2019 business and strategy in the medium- to long-term. This generates uncertainty concerning future climate events and the solutions that might be encountered to mitigate these risks. On those grounds, the Company uses qualitative and quantitative climate-related scenario analysis for three main purposes:\n\nTo make technology mix projections\n\nThe assessment of transition climate-related risks is based on a qualitative and quantitative climate-related scenario analysis. The scenarios used by Stellantis notably include potential scenarios for technological development or market conditions. Marketing and products division teams use various climate-related scenarios based on internal assessment, that are benchmarked with business partners and external scenarios developed by climate specialists, to ensure consistency with the 1.5\u00b0C scenario.\n\nThe output of those scenarios is the potential market evolution by energy and technologies and for different geographical zones, taking into account electricity mix projections in the countries considered. This analysis enables Stellantis to understand the minimum and maximum thresholds of electrified vehicles needed on the market to be aligned with the Paris Agreement. The use of climate-related scenarios also helps with identifying the share of effort to be made to optimize CO\u2082 emissions on conventional thermal vehicles in order to reach Stellantis targets relating to the average CO\u2082 emissions of all vehicles.\n\nTo set greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets\n\nThe use of climate-related scenarios supports the development of company-wide climate-related targets and the targets defined for scopes 1, 2 and 3 are aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C scenario. The assumptions for the decarbonization of electricity are based on the International Energy Agency scenarios.\n\nFor more information refer to 6.1 TCFD.Sc\nTo measure Stellantis\u2019 assets exposure to climate events\n\nStellantis\u2019 assessment of physical climate-related risks for Stellantis assets and for its suppliers is based on a qualitative and quantitative climate-related scenario analysis. The Company relies on its insurance partners who notably use natural disaster risk analyses from insurance databases, such as NatCatService from Munich RE. One of the most extreme scenarios considered in these databases is the IPCC RCP 8.5 scenario, the \u201cworst-case climate scenario\u201d studied in the IPCC fifth assessment report.\n\nSpecifically for water stress risk, the Company uses the business-as-usual scenario (SSP2 RCP8.5) of the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas for 2030 to conduct sensitivity analysis and stress testing.\n\n2.3.3 CLIMATE EMBEDDED INTO BUSINESS PLANNING VIA THE USE OF AN INTERNAL PRICE OF CARBON\n\nRegarding \u201ccarbon pricing\u201d, Stellantis acknowledges - and has started to integrate into its various decision processes - the principle of regulatory pricing of GHG emissions, such as EU Emissions Trading System (ETS).\n\n- The principle is already implemented for technical levers that reduce vehicle CO\u2082 tailpipe emissions, allowing Stellantis to propose an optimized set of CO\u2082 reduction levers on its vehicles based on a cost-efficiency analysis.\n- For upcoming new vehicle programs cost of compensation through carbon removal technologies of their global carbon footprint \u2013 including purchased parts - is assessed and is implemented in profitability study when relevant.\n- All plants have CO\u2082 reduction targets and are required to present roadmaps to reach Stellantis carbon net zero ambition and present yearly progress. The decision-making process which allows capital investments in carbon reduction projects takes carbon price into account as well as the alignment with the decarbonization goals.\n\nIn any case, Stellantis\u2019 decarbonization pace is driven by its commitment to cut 2021 emissions by 50% in 2030 and by more than 90% in 2038, not by a trade-off between decarbonization costs and costs of remaining emissions.\n2.4 Climate governance and decision bodies to lead actions\n\nIn order to have an efficient governance to support the implementation of decisions related to climate actions, Stellantis has embedded climate issues at various levels of the organization, with responsibility exercised within the Company\u2019s management and executive functions. Taking steps for climate to be central in decisions and operations can protect performance and enable Stellantis to improve its economic and financial efficiency by safeguarding the value of its assets, managing its risks more effectively and protecting its value and sustainability in the medium- to long-term.\n\n2.4.1 SUPERVISORY BODIES: STRIVING FOR LONG-TERM CLIMATE RESILIENCE\n\nBodies responsible for climate risks and opportunities oversight and control\n\nStellantis N.V. has a one-tier board: the Board of Directors is responsible for management and strategic direction of the Company as well as oversight and control.\n\nThe CEO is supported by the Top Executive Team aiming to secure worldwide profitable growth for Stellantis.\n\nWithin this governance structure, the Board of Directors considers subjects that link to the strategic plan. Climate being a key topic, the Board of Directors ensures that the strategy fits with Stellantis long-term vision and climate resilience, but also that related risks and opportunities stemming from the effects of climate change are properly identified and managed.\n\nThe CEO and the Strategy Council are responsible for defining the overall environmental strategy, including Climate related policies. The CEO reports to the Board of Directors.\n\nMajor strategic projects with significant impact on the CO\u2082 emissions of the Company or its products are being brought to the Board of Directors for review and decisions. Those projects can be related to vehicle CO\u2082 emissions reduction, as well as product planning or new mobility offers with CO\u2082 emission reduction targets.\n\nOther major projects that can be impacted by the consequences of climate change, such as the location of new sites, are also reviewed by the Board.\n\nThe Board reviews the related financial implications of strategic projects with significant impact on CO\u2082 emissions, such as the CAPEX or strategic transformation needed to implement these projects. The Board discusses these projects for approval after being informed about aspects such as CO\u2082 emission consequences and expected changes in the future mobility market.\n\nDuring Board meetings, Stellantis\u2019 strategic climate commitments, their implementation and their progress versus targets, are discussed to the Board of Directors, in order to deliver relevant information on the climate-related CSR issues impacting the organization.\nBoard of Directors committees: incorporation of climate related topics\n\nWith its 11 members, the Board of Directors has implemented three Committees with specific roles:\n\n- the Audit Committee;\n- the ESG Committee;\n- the Remuneration Committee.\n\nThese specialized Committees prepare and produce work for the Board of Directors. Each Committee issues proposals, recommendations and opinions within the scope of its responsibilities.\n\nESG Committee\n\nThe ESG Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating reports on the Company\u2019s sustainable development policies and practices, management standards, strategy, performance and governance globally. It is also responsible for reviewing, assessing and making recommendations regarding strategic guidelines for sustainability-related issues and reviewing the annual CSR Report.\n\nIn 2022 climate change-related topics have been addressed by the Committee in its meetings.\n\n2.4.2 EXECUTIVE BODIES: PUTTING CLIMATE RESPONSIBILITY AS A CENTRAL THEME IN EXECUTIVE DECISION-MAKING\n\nThe Top Executive Team has a broad reach across the organization. Therefore, the Team has a global vision of climate-sensitive challenges and the impacts that these challenges have on the Stellantis business model and management bodies. The Top Executive Team monitors progress against climate commitments and objectives, and reviews the top risks with a particular focus on climate change, especially vehicle CO\u2082 emissions, as the most strategic CSR issue for Stellantis.\n\nTherefore, climate-sensitive issues are embedded in decisions made by the Top Executive Team on reviewing and guiding major plans of action, annual budgets or business plans.\n\nAt the Executive level, two global Committees review climate-related topics:\n\nThe Strategy Council\n\nThe role of the Strategy Council is to look at the long-term future and potential courses of action for growth and to define the Strategic Plan and validate the corresponding investment plans. Since the topic of CO\u2082 emissions of vehicles is a strategic issue for Stellantis, the Strategy Council\u2019s role is to verify that proposals on these topics fit the Company\u2019s strategy and its execution.\nThe Strategy Council meets monthly, to direct the strategy regarding vehicle CO\u2082 emissions and to review on a quarterly basis the overall carbon net zero roadmap with the Top Executive Team. The main objectives are to:\n\n- Share the forecast of vehicle CO\u2082 emission average for short, medium and long-term in different countries and geographical areas (especially where CAFE/CO\u2082 regulation exists, such as in the U.S., Europe, China, Brazil, Japan, Korea, India, Australia, etc) and decide on action plans;\n- Share the scenarios on hypotheses worked out by the Company\u2019s experts:\n  - using internal data related to Stellantis\u2019 current technologies\n  - using external data related to climate scenarios and market trends (regulation assumptions, energy mix evolution, uptake of electrified vehicles, etc.)\n  - covering risks regarding the supply chain including shortages.\n- Approve global action plans and make the necessary decisions to achieve Stellantis carbon net zero roadmap consistently with the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan.\n\nThe range of attendees demonstrates that the CO\u2082 issue is at the core of Stellantis activities and strategy: the CEO is the Chairman of the Strategy Council. Top Executive Team members from Planning, Manufacturing, Purchasing & Supply Chain, General Counsel, Human Resources & Transformation, Finance, Regions, Brands and Engineering also participate. The frequent briefings of Top Executive Team members during the Strategy Council meetings about climate-related topics such as Life Cycle Assessment or carbon neutrality are meant for top managers to be up-to-date regarding climate change.\n\nThe Industrial Committee\n\nReflecting Stellantis\u2019 commitment to embed CO\u2082 issues within executive decision-making, the Industrial Committee was established in 2021. It provides notably executive bodies within Stellantis with a global overview of CO\u2082 issues within industrial activities. This instance validates the mid- and long-term vision about CO\u2082 emissions from industrial activities. This committee reviews all initiatives related to the plants to ensure that they are following the decarbonization strategy.\n\nStrategic and operational decision-making to drive climate risks and opportunities management across the organization\n\nCO\u2082 Corporate Office\n\nIn the planning division, the CO\u2082 Corporate office is leading a global cross-functional team to drive all the action plans to go towards CO\u2082 emissions reduction and carbon net zero objective.\n\nThe Executive Vice President, Planning holds direct and specific responsibility on corporate CO\u2082 emission average, provides orientation for the development of new vehicles and in particular low-carbon vehicles. The Planning division translates Stellantis strategy into product plans and supervises their implementation by steering the development of vehicle and subassembly programs with the responsibility for their economic performance.\nSeveral climate issues fall into the scope of the Executive Vice President, Engineering, who supervises the research and development of low emission technologies as well as the reduction of the impact on air quality of the Company\u2019s technologies and the wise use of materials in the vehicle life cycle.\n\nThe Executive Vice President, Purchasing and Supply Chain, is involved in reducing emissions from purchased goods and services since they will represent an increasing portion of the Company\u2019s CO\u2082 footprint. The division monitors the environmental performance and CO\u2082 emissions of suppliers and uses local sourcing as a way to enhance CO\u2082 performance of Stellantis. It also manages the logistics challenges on CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nThe Executive Vice President, Manufacturing, coordinates the deployment of Stellantis environmental policy for manufacturing and research sites. In addition, the Executive VP manages an annual investment plan that targets plant operations compliance with regulatory changes, while mitigating pollution and environmental risks. In addition to product strategy, which emphasizes the development of low-carbon vehicles, the Executive Vice President Manufacturing focuses the Manufacturing Division on programs and actions to reduce the Company\u2019s carbon footprint through a reduction of energy consumption and an increase of renewable sources.\n\nThe Executive Vice President, Customer Experience, is responsible for the Company\u2019s Quality Policy and the Conformity of Production of the homologated vehicles, notably their conformity to the vehicles CO\u2082 emission requirements.\n\nThe Executive Vice President, Human Resources and Transformation contributes to the Company\u2019s transition to a low-carbon economy by providing the necessary skills through the attraction of talent, the upscaling of employees and the co-construction of the Company\u2019s future via social dialogue with employees\u2019 representatives. In addition, the Human Resources and Transformation Division is widely developing teleworking and online meetings to reduce the carbon footprint linked to employees commuting daily from home to the workplace or travelling between Company locations. Real Estate assets are also managed to minimize their carbon footprint and their resilience to physical risks. This Executive Vice President also supervises the Audit and Compliance Department in charge of the Company\u2019s risk management and internal control.\n\nThe Executive Vice Presidents for mobility and connectivity services, have an essential role in the implementation of new mobility solutions and the development of Free2move and Leasys, Stellantis\u2019 mobility brands, with the ambition to make them the preferred mobility service providers for customers.\n\nThe Office of the General Counsel provides climate change-related, CO\u2082 regulatory updates and legal support to the Company\u2019s organizations. Among other matters, it deals with GHG-related governmental enforcement and private litigations. The Public Affairs Department, under the responsibility of the General Counsel, is responsible for supporting the Company\u2019s interactions with institutions concerning climate.\n\nFinally, across the regions and brands, consistency on climate change is also targeted at the Top Executive Team level, since the Executive Vice Presidents of the Company\u2019s geographical business regions or brands are in charge of implementing climate action plans in their area of responsibility and working to the achievement of the objectives set by the Executive Committee.\n2.4.3 EMBEDDING CLIMATE ACROSS VARIOUS MANAGEMENT LEVELS\n\nClimate risks and opportunities management is shared across the organization. Meeting the climate-related commitments is highly strategic for Stellantis. Therefore, CO\u2082 dedicated targets are annually set at various management levels and according to job perimeters (defined and reviewed during the annual performance review). Corresponding incentive plans are in place to foster the climate performance of the Company and the achievement of the set targets. Individual salary raises and bonuses are linked to the annual performance assessment, which can notably take into account some of the following carbon-related targets for certain employees.\n\nExamples of incentives plans for the management of climate-related issues\n\n| ORGANIZATIONAL DIVISIONS | CLIMATE-RELATED TARGETS |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------|\n| All Stellantis employees eligible for the incentive plans | Reductions in carbon emissions principally through the growth in production and sales of electric vehicles |\n| Chief Executive Officer | Short-term CO\u2082-related targets, on the implementation of specific programs aligned with the ambition to reduce average CO\u2082 emissions of the vehicles sold worldwide. Vehicle project managers can have targets based on vehicle CO\u2082 performance. |\n| Top Executive Team members | Short-term CO\u2082 reduction targets based on improved energy consumption and increased share of decarbonized electricity. Energy, environment and facility managers are operationally involved in facilities environmental management and energy saving and have targets related to energy savings in terms of CO\u2082 emission reduction. |\n| Planning | Short-term CO\u2082 reduction targets based on the increase of the share of strategic suppliers demonstrating a CO\u2082 trend compliant with the Paris Agreement and on the implementation of processes allowing to reduce CO\u2082 emission of purchased parts for EVs. |\n| Manufacturing | |\n| Purchasing & Supply Chain | |\n\nThis incentive plan demonstrates the integration of climate objectives in the compensation system across the organization. The 2023 annual bonus plan will include the additional ESG metric of reductions in carbon emissions principally through the growth in production and sales of electric vehicles.\n2.5 Vehicle CO\u2082 emissions\n\nCutting CO\u2082 vehicles emissions is the first dimension of Stellantis\u2019 decarbonization strategic plan. The levers on Well-to-Wheel CO\u2082 emissions presented in this section support Stellantis to meet its objective of reducing by 50% its carbon footprint in 2030 compared to 2021, on the Company\u2019s path to carbon net zero in 2038.\n\n2.5.1 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nStellantis is committed to reducing its CO\u2082 emissions in the various regions in which it operates. Stellantis\u2019 strategy is to strive for compliance with Corporate Average Fuel Economy and CO\u2082 regulations worldwide. As they are by far the Company\u2019s main carbon footprint component, emissions from use of sold products (use phase of new sold vehicles) are at the center of the Company\u2019s carbon net zero objective, which was determined using a Well-to-Wheel approach.\n\nThe main levers for the Company to reduce vehicle CO\u2082 emissions are:\n\n- a LEV mix ramp-up, offering a wide range of BEV and PHEV;\n- a zero-emission fuel cell offer for LCVs, complementary to full battery models;\n- a BEV-by-design platform strategy to be operational from 2024;\n- a vertical integration strategy aiming to control the LEV value chain and its costs, to secure supply and quality;\n- the use of MHEV technologies;\n- the deployment of technical levers to improve all key aspects of energy consumption: for example, aerodynamics, rolling resistance and electrical consumption.\n\n2.5.2 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nGiven its high stake for Stellantis, resources are mobilized across the Company for its electrification: from the definition of the strategy to the sales in all regions, with the involvement of planning, engineering, manufacturing and supply chain divisions.\n\n2.5.2.1 Managing vehicles CO\u2082 emissions\n\nStellantis incorporates CO\u2082 emissions management from product planning to sales. Dedicated tools have been put in place to provide real-time information on the current status and forecasts of CO\u2082 emissions for all Stellantis brands, allowing the revision of production program and commercial policy accordingly.\n2.5.2.2 Investment in innovative tech to reduce CO\u2082 emissions of products\n\nTo limit CO\u2082 emissions from vehicles, Stellantis is continuing to develop efficient products by implementing technical solutions whose cost effectiveness is beneficial for its customers. The Company plans to invest more than \u20ac30 billion through 2025 in electrification and software, while continuing to be one of the automotive efficiency front runners, with investment efficiency significantly better than industry average, with respect to total Capex and research and development spend versus revenues.\n\nPatent strategy\n\nOur patented inventions are a key factor in working toward these objectives and provide us with a strategic competitive advantage. In 2022, Stellantis published a total of 1,177 patents applications that were mainly focused on major challenges of tomorrow\u2019s mobility, notably the development of new powertrains to meet our customer expectations for energy transition and sustainable and responsible mobility: engines and transmissions for electrified vehicles, batteries, fuel cells and their control strategies, as well as driver assistance systems, connectivity and services; vehicle platforms comfort and safety equipment.\n\nFuel Cell: an additional opportunity in Stellantis\u2019 portfolio\n\nThrough its Hydrogen Fuel cell Center of Competence in R\u00fcsselsheim (Germany), Stellantis is leading research to develop Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) technology.\n\nThe research is built around the following pillars:\n\n- design to customer: LCV market, B2B, Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) centric, shipping volume and payload preserved;\n- design to optimize development cost: right power architecture associated with a plug-in battery and a high level of carry over platform and e-powertrain;\n- global offering: Stellantis/Energy providers partnerships including vehicle, aftersales, leasing, services, energy infrastructure and supply.\n\nAs a result, the Company began the launch in 2021 of a Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV) fleet equipped with this FCEV technology. This technology combines hydrogen fuel cell and electric battery to provide the energy to the electric motor. It allows Stellantis to place a zero emission FCEV solution, complementary to the 100% battery-electric solution, and thus will attract new customers, in particular those who drive frequently long distances and need to refuel quickly. This version offers 400 km of range at a refueling time for a complete fill with hydrogen of three minutes only, without any compromise on payload and volume. This technology is already available on Citro\u00ebn, Peugeot and Opel models and production capacity will reach 5,000 vehicles per year from 2024 because of new investments at Hordain plant in France.\n\nMore information on Hydrogen Fuel Cell is available on the corporate website.\nUse of alternative fuels\n\nAlternative fuels are also a key component of Stellantis\u2019 strategy to achieve fleet greenhouse gases (GHG) emission reduction, considering that the production of alternative fuels emits less CO\u2082 which can compensate for tailpipe CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nIn close collaboration with leading renewable fuel producers, Stellantis makes sure that products in the hand of customers will be well prepared for these fuels.\n\nWithin Stellantis, the Center of Competence Alternative Fuels (CCAF) leads the research and development activities and is responsible for technological, strategic and application knowhow on Alternative Fuels.\n\nAlternative fuels from biological origin (Biofuels)\n\n- Ethanol flex-fuel vehicles in Brazil: Stellantis develops flex-fuel vehicles (FFV), which run on gasoline-ethanol blends in variable proportions: in 2022, more than 500,000 Stellantis flex-fuel vehicles were registered in Brazil.\n- Stellantis is also working to anticipate the potential increase of bio component rate like ethanol or Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil, in order to have vehicles that are compatible with future European standards.\n- To support the development of \u201cadvanced biofuels\u201d from non-food resources, such as biomass waste, non-hazardous organic waste and micro-algae, Stellantis has conducted projects such as lipid biofuels from micro-algae in France (PE Shamash project) and in Brazil with the Federal University of Parana in Curitiba.\n\nAlternative fuels from non-biological origin: non-fossil e-fuels\n\nStellantis is also actively exploring the potential of e-fuels, synthetic fuels produced from the combination of carbon dioxide and hydrogen from water electrolysis with renewable electricity. The objective is to reduce production cost and prices of such e-fuels and to develop direct air capture of CO\u2082 to optimize GHG balance.\n\n2.5.3 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\n2.5.3.1 CO\u2082 performances of Stellantis vehicles: a trajectory in line with the COP21 commitments\n\nThe whole Company is committed to CO\u2082 reduction efforts, from the Engineering Department to commercial network.\n\nA Tank-to-Wheel performance compliant with CO\u2082 regulations\n\nBeing fully compliant to regulatory requirements is an essential prerequisite for Stellantis.\n\nDriven by the electrification ramp-up and technical improvements brought to conventional vehicles, the CO\u2082 emissions of sold vehicles are improving year-over-year.\n\n3 Production of a methyl ester from the microalgae Nannochloropsis grown in raceways on the French west coast, Fuel Elsevier, Fuel 153(2015)640-649\nIn 2021 and 2022, in the European Union and United Kingdom, Stellantis has reached its Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulatory targets, both for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles without buying any external credits.\n\nStellantis is also planning for compliance with local regulations in all other CO\u2082 regulated markets, potentially leveraging opportunities to carry forward and carry back credits where applicable through local regulation with the aim of ensuring self-compliance of Stellantis without additional credit purchases from other manufacturers.\n\nStellantis is striving to achieve a higher level of CO\u2082 performance year after year by:\n\n- Investing in LEV technologies\n- Increasing our LEV sales with the ambition to be one of the top players of LEV markets in the future years, especially in Europe and in the U.S.\n- Optimizing technologies that benefit both LEV and ICE vehicles.\n\n*Outside of Stellantis brands and Stellantis JV\u2019s*\n2.5.3.2 Electrification: an ambitious plan to roll out electric and hybrid technologies\n\nStellantis responds to the environmental challenges associated with vehicle use thanks to technological solutions designed to drive powerful breakthroughs in fuel efficiency and CO\u2082 emissions. The introduction of zero-emission electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles, are poised to enable the company consolidate its position in the low-emission vehicle (LEV) segment in its various markets.\n\nPlacing short-, medium- and long-term quantitative targets on the share of LEVs sales in the total sales and on the percentage of nameplates available in a LEV version enables Stellantis to define and track alignment with a clear roadmap of how to attain its fleet CO\u2082 emissions reduction targets.\n\n**Stellantis electrification roadmap**\n\nEach of the Company\u2019s 14 vehicle brands is committed to offering fully electrified solutions.\n\nIn 2022, 48 percent of Passenger Cars nameplates in Europe (versus 40 percent in 2021) and 14 percent of Passenger Cars and Light Duty Trucks nameplates in the U.S. (versus 10 percent in 2021) were available in an electrified version.\n\nIn 2025:\n\n- 96% of the Passenger Cars (PC) models marketed by Stellantis in Europe will be offered in full electric (BEV) or plug-in hybrid versions (PHEV);\n- 91% of the Passenger Cars, Light Duty Trucks (LDT) models marketed by Stellantis in the U.S. will be proposed in electrified version.\n\nBy 2030, Stellantis targets to include a BEV version of all our passenger car models marketed in Europe and all our passenger car and light duty trucks models marketed in the U.S.\nAfter four BEVs and six PHEV in 2021, three new BEV and five new PHEV vehicles have been launched in 2022:\n\n- **BEV**: Fiat E-Doblo, Fiat E-Scudo (in Europe) and Citro\u00ebn All-New \u00cb-C3 (in India)\n- **PHEV**: Peugeot 308 SW, Citro\u00ebn C5 X, Opel Astra, Alfa Romeo Tonale, Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe\n\nIn 2023, nine BEV and three PHEV are planned to extend Stellantis LEV offer.\n\nStellantis also offers a sustainable urban mobility line-up, including Citro\u00ebn AMI, AMI Cargo and Opel ROCKS-e. Those urban low footprint electric devices, accessible to young drivers, are an additional answer to current mobility requirements, especially in cities.\nThis electrification roadmap supports the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan objective to grow, year by year, the worldwide LEV sales mix and to reach in 2030 a BEV sales mix of 100% in Europe for PC and 50% in the U.S. for PC and LDT.\n\nBased on internal estimates, in 2022:\n\n- In Europe 30, LEV sales represented 18.3% of Stellantis passenger cars (versus 12.8% in 2021),\n- In U.S. 4.9% of passenger cars and light duty trucks sold by Stellantis were LEVs (versus 3.4% in 2021).\n- more than 40% of electric light commercial registered on European market were Stellantis vehicles.\n\nLEV mixes increase is one of our main levers on our roadmap to carbon net zero.\n\nStellantis\u2019 fast LEV mix ramp-up is supported by:\n\n- Europe 30 = EU 27 (excluding Malta) + Norway + Iceland + UK + Switzerland (inc. Liechtenstein)\n\n> For Stellantis\u2019 detailed sales mix by energy type refer to 2.5.4.2\nA pure BEV-focused platform strategy\n\nA vertical integration strategy to master the LEV value chain\n\nA charging and energy strategy that aims to position Stellantis in the e-mobility ecosystem\n\nThese three levers are consistent and intertwined. Stellantis strategy to gain control over the LEV value chain is supported by specific EV-related services from Free2move eSolutions joint venture that delivers charging infrastructure solutions, charging-as-a-service and advanced energy services to European customers. This is expected to be leveraged in the BEV-focused platform strategy, which means that Stellantis should have a 360-degree approach to control the performance that it delivers to the customers, both in terms of range, drive smoothness, quality, but also the high level of control of cost and supply.\n\nDIALOGUE WITH STAKEHOLDERS\n\nElectrification is one of the key pillars supporting Dare Forward 2030 long term Stellantis strategic plan (announced March 1, 2022)\n\nThrough a 360-degree approach, Stellantis electrification strategy includes:\n\n- Electrification roadmap for product line up and adaptation of our manufacturing facilities\n- New integrated value chain covering the product life cycle Mastering the LEV value chain\n- Development of future batteries technologies (Solid-state) Battery technologies innovation: more energy density, faster to charge, less expensive\n- Raw material availability increase Link to paragraph Material supply\n- Wide range of services for the customers Link to An active role in contributing to affordable and clean mobility\n\n2.5.3.2.1 The pure BEV-focused platform strategy of Stellantis\n\nFrom 2024, the sales of Stellantis\u2019 LEV products worldwide are expected to be driven by a 4 platform BEV-focused strategy for Passenger Cars: Stella Small for the A, B and C segments; Stella Medium for C and D segments; Stella Large for D and E segments and Stella Frame platform for the electrified E and F segments SUVs and the pickup trucks. Covering the various market segments and regions where Stellantis operates, these full-BEV platforms should enable high modularity with parts and technology commonality without any compromise on BEV performance.\nThis limited number of platforms will be BEV-focused to ensure that the Company has a volume scale effect that is intended to drive the cost competitiveness and therefore the profitability of Stellantis, in order to compensate for electrification costs. Being BEV-focused, they will deliver a significant performance to address the range anxiety of BEVs. The Stella Small for A, B and C entry products is expected to deliver more than 500 kilometers of range. The Stella Medium is expected to deliver more than 700 kilometers of range. The Stella Large is expected to deliver more than 800 kilometers of range. On the Stella Frame, the expected range is 800 kilometers.\n\nUntil the launch of Stellantis\u2019 BEV-by-design platforms, existing multi-energy platforms will allow the manufacture of the next generation of electric vehicles.\n\nAs a result, Stellantis has the flexibility to adapt to changes in the energy mix in its various markets and can offer its customers a comprehensive range of technologies that meet their usage needs and contribute to increasingly responsible mobility.\n\n**STELLANTIS\u2019 BEV-BY-DESIGN PLATFORM MOMENTUM**\n\n| 4 BEV BY DESIGN PLATFORMS | STLA SMALL | 500 km | 300 miles |\n|---------------------------|------------|--------|-----------|\n| HIGH ENERGY DENSITY AND EFFICIENT BATTERIES | STLA MEDIUM | 700 km | 440 miles |\n| OPTIMIZED SEGMENTATION FOR FULL MARKET COVERAGE | STLA LARGE | 800 km | 500 miles |\n| CROSS SHARED COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS | STLA FRAME | 800 km | 500 miles |\n\nThe sales of Stellantis\u2019 LEV products worldwide will be driven by a 4 platform BEV-focused strategy for Passenger Cars.\nCOMPANY TRANSFORMATION THROUGH THE SOFTWARE STRATEGY\n\nThe heart of the transformation to customer-centric services is the new electrical/electronic (E/E) and software architecture. As announced on December 7, 2021 during the Stellantis Software Day, three new tech platforms (STLA Brain, STLA SmartCockpit, STLA AutoDrive) will be launched in 2024 and will be deployed, at scale, across the four vehicle platforms of Stellantis over the following two years.\n\nSTLA Brain will be fully Over-the-Air (OTA) capable, with 30 modules addressed, versus 10 today, making it highly flexible. It is a service-oriented architecture fully integrated with the cloud that connects electronic control units within the vehicle with the vehicle\u2019s central high performing computer (HPC) via a high-speed data bus.\n\nIt breaks today\u2019s bond between hardware and software generations, enabling software developers to create and update features and services quickly without waiting for a new hardware launch.\n\n2.5.3.2.2 Mastering the LEV value chain\n\nStellantis is working to secure and grow its share of the added value relating to low-emissions vehicles, having found a balance between partnerships with expert companies and in-house design and manufacturing.\n\nWith this strategy, Stellantis is targeting to control 80% of the BEV value with its joint ventures which is more than the share of value that the company controls for ICE (in both cases without taking into account raw materials).\nStellantis is working to secure and grow its share of the added value relating to low-emissions vehicles.\nStrategic move to become a leading player in battery cells and modules\n\nGetting ready for the electric future of mobility, Stellantis is focused on securing its battery cells supply as it is the most cost-, quality- and performance sensitive matter of an EV, which is the battery cell. For that purpose, the Automotive Cells Company (ACC) joint venture was created in September 2020 between former PSA/Opel and Total/Saft. In September 2021 Mercedes-Benz AG agreed to join ACC as its third partner. First ACC gigafactories will be located in Douvrin (France) for the start of production in 2024 and in Kaiserslautern (Germany) for the start of production in 2025. A third facility located in Termoli (Italy) has been announced for a total ACC cell capacity of more than 120GWh by 2030. ACC capacity plan will mobilize an investment of more than \u20ac7 billion. The technology used targets to offer the highest level of energy performance, both in terms of range and charging time and improved carbon footprint compared to current results. This project aims to position ACC as a major competitive player in supplying electric vehicle manufacturers with high-performance batteries.\n\nIn 2022, Stellantis finalized a joint venture with Samsung SDI for the production of battery cells and modules for North America, targeted to begin production in Kokomo, Indiana (U.S.) in 2025 with initial annual production capacity of 23 GWh. In 2022, Stellantis and LG Energy Solution also announced a plan to invest $5 billion CAD in a joint venture for Canada\u2019s first large scale lithium-ion battery production plant, which will be built in Windsor, Canada. The agreement between Stellantis and LG Energy Solution is subject to customary closing conditions. Other joint ventures, with Nidec Corporation and Punch Powertrain, were established to design and manufacture electric propulsion system-related components. Total capacity of these two plants is planned to be close to 80 GWh which will contribute to support the global Stellantis demand of 400 GWh by 2030.\n\nStrategic partnerships regarding e-components integration for next generation of electrified Powertrain\n\nAs announced in the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, in order to increase control of cost, quality and performance of electric powertrain-related components, Stellantis has embedded their design and manufacture through joint ventures \u2013 respectively Nidec Stellantis e-motors and Punch Powertrain Stellantis e-transmissions \u2013 but also reduction gears and battery pack assembly. Thereby, new e-components for PHEV, BEV and MHEV applications are integrated in the upcoming generation of electrified powertrains. Innovation activities aim to reduce cost, improve efficiency and compactness.\n\nNidec Stellantis e-motors\n\nStellantis formed a joint venture with Nidec Leroy-Somer Holding in the field of electric motors. Backed by a \u20ac220 million shared investment, the partnership should lead to the development of a cutting-edge range of electric motors for electrified vehicles. The joint venture aims to meet the needs of both Stellantis and other automakers.\n\nBased in Carri\u00e8res-sous-Poissy, just outside Paris, the entity currently comprises 240 employees dedicated to designing, developing and manufacturing new electric powertrains to be produced at the Tr\u00e9mery plant (Moselle, France). This plant has been upgraded through industrial investments of more than \u20ac93 million to date. Production has started in 2022 and is expected to exceed one million motors per year by 2024 for PHEV and BEV vehicles of Stellantis and possibly other automakers.\nPunch Powertrain Stellantis e-transmissions\n\nStellantis and Punch Powertrain have formed the e-Transmissions Assembly joint venture. The entity is backed by a shared investment of \u20ac82 million and will focus on producing the future generation of electrified dual-clutch transmissions (eDCTs) as from 2023.\n\nFeaturing a 48-volt configuration, the transmission will be fitted on Stellantis\u2019 future MHEV models. The eDCT will be designed and developed in Punch Powertrain research centers in Belgium and the Netherlands and manufactured at Stellantis\u2019 Metz plant in Moselle (France), a facility chosen for its cost-efficiency and recognized for its expertise in gearbox production. The Metz plant is expected to have an annual production capacity of 600,000 eDCT gearboxes, supported by a \u20ac57 million industrial investment to date. To extend further the manufacturing capacities of eDCT gearbox, a second plant in Mirafiori (Turin - Italy) has been announced in September 2022 and is expected to start deliveries in 2024.\n\nA second joint venture was established to design, manufacture and supply state of the art components and sub-systems for the future generation of the electrified transmission, the Dual Clutch Transmission (DT2) by Punch Powertrain which is cost efficient and compact, available in Mild hybrid 48V, plug-in hybrid or conventional variants.\n\nIndustrial footprint of LEV-related activities\n\nELECTRIFICATION FOOTPRINT: PICTURE 2022>2025\n\n- Battery Cell Gigafactory\n- Battery Tray Process\n- Battery Assembly Process\n- ePWT Process\n- Electrified Transmission\nMaterial supply\n\nMany raw materials used for High-Voltage Batteries are in demand due to the shift to electrification. The manner in which the materials are extracted and processed are often riskier and require appropriate monitoring. For example, cobalt is of growing interest for the auto industry due to its use in electric vehicle batteries. Stellantis participates in a variety of projects related to materials research, notably to reduce or substitute critical raw materials with other more sustainable metals in high-voltage batteries. We are a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) to build capacity in the extended supply chain down through the mine level. Activities to conduct voluntary due diligence efforts are underway with our suppliers. We have used the Cobalt Reporting Template (CRT) from the RMI to begin preliminary data gathering. Stellantis is conducting a due diligence program on these raw materials, with a priority on Cobalt and Lithium, in partnership with RCS Global.\n\nAs announced in the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, to secure lithium availability, Stellantis signed a binding agreement with Vulcan Energy to supply battery grade lithium hydroxide in Europe for use in electrified vehicles.\n\nOn June 24, 2022, Stellantis announced a \u20ac50 million (A$76 million) equity investment in Vulcan Energy Resources Limited and an extension of the original binding offtake agreement signed in November 2021 for supply in Europe from 5 years to 10 years (up to 99,000 tons per year). The equity investment will go towards Vulcan\u2019s planned production expansion drilling in its producing Upper Rhine Valley Brine Field. These are subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.\n\nVulcan\u2019s Zero Carbon Lithium\u2122 Project in the Upper Rhine Valley in Germany uses geothermal energy to produce battery-quality lithium hydroxide from brine without the use of fossil fuels and minimal water usage, reducing the generation of carbon in the battery metals supply chain. The location in Germany, proximal to Stellantis\u2019 European gigafactories, will allow to reduce the transport distance of lithium chemicals.\n\nTo secure North American electric vehicle production, On June 2, 2022, Stellantis announced the signing of a binding offtake agreement with Controlled Thermal Resources Ltd. (\u201cCTR\u201d) for CTR to supply battery grade lithium hydroxide for use in Stellantis\u2019 North American electrified vehicle production (up to 25,000 tons per year).\n\nBeyond lithium sourcing, Stellantis N.V is paving its way to a secured sourcing of other raw materials:\n\n- Nickel sulphate:\n  - a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) has been signed with Alliance Nickel Limited for the future sale of quantities of battery grade nickel and cobalt sulphate products from the NiWest Nickel-Cobalt Project in Western Australia (NiWest). This project is expected to produce approximately 90,000 tpa (tons per annum) of battery grade nickel and cobalt sulphate for the electric vehicle market.\nA five-year supply agreement - starting in 2025 - has been signed in January 2023 with Finland-based Terrafame Ltd. Due to its unique production technology, the carbon footprint of the nickel sulphate produced by Terrafame is among the smallest in the industry.\n\nManganese sulphate:\nA binding agreement has been signed in January 2023 with Element 25 for supply of battery grade, high purity manganese sulphate monohydrate to Stellantis for use in electric vehicle (EV) battery packs. The five-year agreement calls for shipments to begin in 2026, a total volume of 45 kilotons, and options to extend the supply term and volumes. Element 25 will source the material from its Butcherbird project in Western Australia and plans to construct a processing facility in the United States. Stellantis will make an equity investment in Element 25.\n\nBattery recycling\nTo make EVs climate change mitigation solutions as effective as possible, Stellantis strives to develop a global circular economy for high-voltage batteries from hybrid and electric vehicles: a re-pair strategy with 21 e-repair centers, a re-man strategy with our remanufacturing center in R\u00fcsselsheim and re-use strategy with Second-life projects. Engaging partnerships with recyclers is a way for Stellantis to secure access to secondary raw materials enabling the production of EVs. Thus, battery recycling is embedded in Stellantis ambitions for circular economy development based on a \u201ccradle-to-cradle\u201d model which will play a major role in reaching 2038 carbon net zero commitment.\n\n2.5.3.2.3 Charging and energy strategy\nAs charging operations is a crucial user experience aspect of e-mobility, Stellantis:\n- technologies contributing to a simple and seamless user experience: plug and charge feature (easy payment process), high power charging (quick charge for long range journey), services facilitating the charging operations\n- the opportunity to make services for the grid, by the energy and power buffering capacity of the vehicles connected to it: Smart charge functions and Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) generate value both for the customers and for the energy operators.\n\nCharging service offering related to electric mobility\nTo ease the customer electric mobility experience and therefore support its LEV mix ramp up, Stellantis has developed a complete service offering:\n- a range of connected services:\n  - Trip Planner and Charging Pass services, to plan a trip and for easy charging at public charging stations\n  - Mobility Pass, to temporarily access other mobility solutions if the electric vehicle autonomy is not sufficient for a long trip\n  - Car Remote, to optimize the charge (charging management and air conditioning preconditioning).\nnew services available at home and in the commercial network:\n\n- Private Charging: devices and installation;\n- after sales: battery capacity certification, adapted roadside assistance, adapted service contracts;\n- electric vehicle skilled contact center.\n\nA partnership signed between Stellantis and Digital Charging Solutions GmbH, will provide Jeep 4xe or Fiat EV customers access to the digital service \u201cMy easy Charge,\u201d offering them a single provider for the largest charging network in the world. With just one app and one single card, the charging solution will provide access to more than 130,000 charging points in 21 European countries. A partnership was also formed between the Jeep Brand and Electrify America to install solar charging stations on Jeep Trails in North America in March 2021.\n\nThe Company\u2019s electric vehicles are already used in many urban carsharing services set up with communities and private partners in numerous European cities.\n\nAn active role in contributing to affordable and clean mobility\n\nBeyond its electric vehicle line up offer, Stellantis is also actively supporting access to an affordable and clean mobility through a dedicated BEVs long-term rental program and e-Mobility program with Free2move eSolutions.\n\n\"Electric as You Go\":\n\nThis new competitive long-term rental program designed by the e-Mobility Business Unit, Banque PSA Finance and Opel Bank aims at providing an affordable driving experience. Started in France for private customers, this program allows them to change their old ICE vehicle to a BEV B-segment car from \u20ac 110 per month plus a cost of use at 7 cents per kilometer (with 500 kms minimum per month). This program will be extended to other full electric vehicles within the Company\u2019s portfolio shortly and is expected to expand to other countries in Europe. It offers the consumers the possibility to pay for their vehicle only when they are actually using it. Combined with the lower operational cost of BEVs, this initiative results in an innovative commercial offer that may contribute to accelerate a sustainable car parc renewal.\n\nFree2move eSolutions:\n\nIn January 2021, Stellantis created Free2move eSolutions, a joint venture with NHOA (formerly Engie EPS, global player in energy storage and active also in EV Fastcharging Infrastructure in Southern Europe), with the ambition to become a leader in the European e-Mobility landscape. Free2move eSolutions has the ambition to support and ease the transition to electric mobility by offering innovative and tailor-made electric solutions for both private and business actors of the value chain.\n\nThrough a digital and seamless journey across all product lines, the scope of Free2move eSolutions activities will range from charging infrastructures (installation, servicing and operations), public and home charging subscriptions with monthly fee, to battery life cycle management and advanced energy services such as Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) integration and energy management solutions to reduce the total cost of vehicle ownership.\nThe joint venture between Stellantis and NHOA is expected to simplify the access to e-Mobility and aims to complement Free2move\u2019s current portfolio with a new set of offers 100% dedicated to electric mobility.\n\nFree2move eSolutions also allowed the implementation of projects, such as the introduction of the exclusive Stellantis easyWallbox, an easy-to-use plug-and-play charging unit, the recently launched Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) pilot project and the innovative customer-oriented energy packages. The newly created company offers a full suite of products and solutions for EV customers such as residential, business and public charging infrastructures as well as green energy packages. It enables customers to charge at home and at any public charging point across Europe with a subscription at a fixed monthly rate.\n\nStellantis expanded the V2G project at the Mirafiori plant in Turin (Italy) to 25MW with 600 EVs connected. V2G technology represents an opportunity to optimize vehicles\u2019 operating costs for the customers\u2019 benefit, as well as contributing to a more sustainable electrical power delivery system. Experiments using this innovative technology have started with a bidirectional charging solution, which both charges the car and returns power to the grid.\n\nIn addition, Stellantis\u2019 partnership with NHOA is developing Atlante, a public Fast and Ultra-Fast Charging network in Southern Europe. The network will be enabled by renewables and energy storage and 100% grid integrated. Free2move eSolutions will act as turn-key technology provider and NHOA will develop the network. Approximately, 5,000 fast and ultra-fast charging points should be installed by 2025 and 35,000 by 2030.\n\n**Rewarding customers for the environmentally conscious driving behaviors**\n\nDeveloped by the green-tech startup Kiri Technologies exclusively for e-Mobility by Stellantis, the system rewards New Fiat 500 drivers in 13 European countries based on their environmentally conscious driving behaviors with KiriCoin, a cryptocurrency that can be spent in a dedicated marketplace. Drivers can check the KiriCoin collected based on an eco:Score obtained according to their driving style. Analysis of the driving style of New Fiat 500 customers has shown that the best participants in the contest drove up to 20% more efficiently than the average. This has a direct positive impact of 20% on charging costs and on the range of the car. The drivers with the best scores receive exclusive extra rewards.\n\n**2.5.3.2.4 Battery technologies innovation: more energy density, faster to charge, less expensive**\n\nBattery technology is key for customers\u2019 acceptance of LEV vehicles since it drives the zero emission range for BEV and PHEV, the charging time to provide a seamless long-range user experience, but also the cost of the system and its safety. Thus, within the ACC joint-venture, Stellantis strives for innovation on battery technologies. The technologies covered include:\n\n- electrochemistry and cells design, with a specific focus on the next generation based on solid-state electrolytes;\n- pack design, including mechanical parts optimization, thermal management, wires;\n- software and Battery Management System (BMS) design.\nFrom 2024, Stellantis plans to base its electrification strategy on 2 battery technologies to offer a wider range of vehicles, to adapt to consumer needs and affordability constraints. These technologies are expected to enable energy density gains and therefore reduce the environmental footprint of the batteries. This dual chemistry strategy relies on:\n\n- a Nickel and Cobalt Free battery, that should enable an energy density between 400 and 500 Wh/L at cell level\n- a Nickel based battery with an even higher energy density, between 600 and 700 Wh/L at cell level.\n\nFrom 2026, competitive solid-state batteries are expected to be introduced in Stellantis\u2019 fleet. A first joint development agreement has been signed with Factorial Energy to advance Factorials\u2019 high-voltage traction solid-state battery technology.\n\n2.5.3.3 Mild & Hybrid Electric Vehicles (MHEV & HEV)\n\nComplementary to development of BEV offer, Stellantis is proposing mild hybrid and hybrid electric vehicles.\n\nThe mild hybrid technology combines a small electric motor with an ICE, in which the hybrid technology recovers the energy generated on braking to reuse it for vehicle motive power, thus cutting down on fuel use and reducing CO\u2082 emission up to 15% compared to a vehicle powered entirely by an ICE.\n\nMHEV technologies are already available on several Stellantis models for some powertrains:\n\n- Jeep Renegade, Jeep Compass, Jeep Wrangler, Fiat 500x, Fiat Tipo, Alfa Romeo Tonale and Ram 1500 - marketed as \u201ceTorque\u201d - are equipped with 48V technology\n- Fiat 500, Fiat Panda, Lancia Ypsilon (in Europe) and Maserati Ghibli are equipped with belt-starter generator solutions.\n\nFrom 2023 onwards, a 48-volt MHEV solution using electrified Dual Clutch Transmission (e-DCT) gearbox, developed with Punch Powertrain, will be widely deployed on Stellantis lineup.\n\nFor the North American market, new investments for a total of $99 million have been announced in three plants to speed up the electrification of the future North American lineup. These investments will allow to provide 1.6-liter, I-4 turbocharged engines, based on current Stellantis production in Europe, predisposed for hybridized applications from 2025.\n\n2.5.3.4 Efficient vehicles: a holistic approach to design vehicles\n\nThe company aims to leverage all the features of its vehicles in order to improve their efficiency, reduce energy consumption and CO\u2082 emissions. Beyond the technologies related to engines and fuels, Stellantis continues to develop technical levers that enable energy consumption gains on both electrified and ICE vehicles such as weight, aerodynamics, vehicle architecture, materials, tire rolling resistance, losses through mechanical friction (brakes, rolling, bearings, etc.), electric consumption (sensors, actuators, engines), comfort features (air conditioning system, etc.), safety features and driver assistance features.\n2.5.3.4.1 Weight: the virtuous cycle of reducing weight\n\nWhile we work to optimize vehicle architecture, we also focus on the choice of materials. High-tensile steel is preferred because of its superior strength. However, whenever technically feasible and cost effective, choosing lower-density materials, such as aluminum, composite materials and thermoplastics instead of steel, can reduce vehicle weight. For example, the 2021 Jeep Wrangler features lightweight, high strength aluminum doors, hinges, hood, fenders and windshield frame, as well as a magnesium swing gate, all of which help boost fuel economy. Innovative process techniques provide further gains (heat stamping, laser welding, joining structure, etc.) by helping reduce the weight of the car body while improving resistance to impact.\n\n2.5.3.4.2 Limited air resistance and rolling resistance\n\nAerodynamics and rolling resistance have an impact on fuel and electrical consumption and the Company endeavors to continually optimize these levers. For instance, since 2020 in Europe active air shutters, under body deflectors, class A efficient tires, lower than 5.9 kg/T, have been widely deployed on vehicles in order to reduce the CO\u2082 consumption for our customers.\n\nIn order to further improve the overall design and the energy efficiency of its upcoming models, Stellantis has decided to invest \u20ac33 million in its test facilities located in Turin (Italy) and Auburn Hills (U.S.) for its electric and autonomous vehicles development.\n\nTECHNOLOGIES FOR EFFICIENT ELECTRIC VEHICLES\n\n- A+ class low rolling resistance tires\n- Aerodynamic rear spoiler\n- Aerodynamic wheels\n- Extended underbody panel\n- Eco LED lighting\n- Electric gearbox\n- Electric motor\n- Wheel deflector\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\nStellantis Invests \u20ac33 Million in Global Testing Hubs for Cutting-Edge Engineering\n\nhttps://www.stellantis.com/en/news/press-releases/2022/june/stellantis-invests-33-million-in-global-testing-hubs-for-cutting-edge-engineering\n2.5.3.4.3 Better management of onboard electricity\nReducing electricity consumption in vehicles is a way to lower energy consumption on conventional and electric vehicles. For instance, in Europe, the Company decided to deploy the following levers:\n\n- optimizing the operating phases of the alternator through an intelligent control system (charge the alternator at times when fuel consumption is lower), lever incorporated into the new generation of engines\n- optimizing the alternator\u2019s efficiency, with the deployment of ultra-high efficiency alternators (80% efficiency compared to less than 70% before)\n- high charge acceptance on 12-volt battery technology to optimize alternator recovery strategy;\n- using specific Light Emitting Diode (LED) lights, widely on the vehicle lines, to optimize the electricity consumption of the lighting functions.\n\n2.5.3.4.4 Reducing the environmental impact of refrigerants\nEuropean Directive 2006/40/EC gradually phases out the use of refrigerants in vehicle air conditioning systems, that provide air conditioning in the passenger compartment, which have a global warming potential (GWP) of more than 150 CO\u2082-eq. This regulation has applied to all models on the EU market that weigh less than 3.5 tons since 2017.\n\nNew types of vehicle produced by Stellantis use refrigerants that meet all regulatory standards. For example, the Peugeot 508, Fiat 500 and Opel Corsa no longer use fluoride gas R134 a.\n\nIn order to reduce environmental impacts, quantities of refrigerant filled in European vehicles were reduced. This good practice was partly rolled out in other regions. Stellantis also carries out refrigerant leakage inspections in assembly plants to check the tightness of the vehicle air conditioning system.\n### 2.5.4 Detailed Key Performance Indicators\n\n#### 2.5.4.1 Sales-weighted\\(^6\\) average fleet fuel economy and CO\\(_2\\) emissions (Tank-to-Wheel)\\(^7\\)\n\n| Regulated region | Category | Volumes* | Results |\n|------------------|----------|----------|---------|\n| **European Union 27 + Norway + Iceland (gCO\\(_2\\)/km)** | M1 (Passenger Cars) | 2022 | 1,828,813 | 105.5 gCO\\(_2\\)/km |\n| | | 2021 | 2,141,837 | 114.8 gCO\\(_2\\)/km |\n| | N1 (Light Commercial Vehicles) | 2022 | 337,887 | 168 gCO\\(_2\\)/km |\n| | | 2021 | 446,629 | 189 gCO\\(_2\\)/km |\n| **United States (mpg)** | Passenger Cars domestic | 2022 | 161,616 | 27.2 mpg |\n| | | 2021 | 201,790 | 27.7 mpg |\n| | Passenger Cars import | 2022 | 12,586 | 30.7 mpg |\n| | | 2021 | 25,208 | 32.3 mpg |\n| | Light Duty Trucks | 2022 | 1,160,416 | 27.0 mpg |\n| | | 2021 | 1,447,313 | 26.9 mpg |\n| **Brazil (MJ/km)** | Total Stellantis | 2022 | 645,628 | 1.7 MJ/km |\n| | | 2021 | 633,139 | 1.9 MJ/km |\n| **China (L/100km)** | Total Domestic | 2022 | 91,231 | 5.4 L/100km |\n| | | 2021 | 102,553 | 6.7 L/100km |\n| | Total Import | 2022 | 19,142 | 9.1 L/100km |\n| | | 2021 | 21,723 | 10.1 L/100km |\n| | Total Stellantis | 2022 | 110,373 | 6.0 L/100km |\n| | | 2021 | 124,276 | 7.3 L/100km |\n\n* Considering registrations, shipments, productions or custom clearance according to local regulations based on Stellantis operational reporting tools.\n\n** The European Commission imposes standardized emission requirements on vehicles sold.

The levers presented in this section aim to enable Stellantis to meet its Dare Forward 2030 objective of reducing its absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50% by 2025 compared to 2021, on the path to carbon net zero in 2038.\n\nThis chapter focuses on energy and climate-related aspects of its manufacturing facilities, offices, warehouses, retail operations and other stationary operations.\n\n2.6.1 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nThe Industrial manufacturing divisions is focusing on Stellantis Environmental and Energy policy to contribute to a decarbonized economy by achieving net zero emissions within its activities worldwide (scope 1 and 2) by 2038.\n\nStellantis is committed to actions that preserve the environment, by implementing initiatives that minimize energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. Such initiatives include using alternative and renewable energy sources, supporting the purchase of energy-efficient products and services and designing manufacturing processes for improvements in energy performance.\n\nThe analysis of our industrial and site CO2 performance showed that the main emissions factors were:\n\n- Energy consumption in the manufacturing plants (including processes and building systems) of which foundries and paint shops are main contributors\n- The electricity source type consumed by the manufacturing plants.\n\nTherefore, Stellantis seeks solutions in its manufacturing processes that enable reductions in energy consumption, with a particular focus on decreasing the use of fossil fuels. This involves an energy management approach that notably maps the energy performance of all manufacturing plants and identifies the areas in need of improvement. This also involves associated short-term capital expenditure to reduce energy consumption. Another lever is to increase the share of renewable energies used by the Company to further reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nStellantis\u2019 ambition is to implement green electricity on a broader scale. Therefore Stellantis has signed contracts in Europe and United States on Photovoltaic and Wind parks which will operate on -and off-site.\n\nEnergy efficiency will play a key-role in our strategy, the main levers to manage industrial greenhouse gas emissions are:\n\n- Managing energy use in manufacturing activities\n- Relying on low CO2 energy sources attributed to:\n  - Green Electricity contracts\n  - Green self-generated electricity projects\n\nFor more Stellantis\u2019 environmental management system refer to 6.3\n\nFor the presentation of the policy elements refer to 2.6.3\n\nFor more information refer to 2.6.3.2\n\nFor more information refer to 2.6.3.3\n\nFor more information refer to 2.6.3.2.1\n\nFor more information refer to 2.6.3.3\nIn an effort to manage energy use, we are defining our joint Energy Management System which is an integral part of the implementation of the Stellantis Production Way (SPW). This managerial approach begins with an initial stage of staff involvement at all levels including the machine operator level, targeting the reduction of energy losses during non-production periods. The following stage consists of developing solutions to reduce consumption during production periods. As solutions are developed, best practices are shared and rolled out across the plants. Stellantis\u2019 environmental and energy management policies focus on methodologies and processes related to the optimization of energy use. At the end of 2022, the majority of the Stellantis plants were ISO 50001 certified, representing approximately 74% of the Company\u2019s total energy consumption versus 77% in 2021. Accredited third parties certify the Company\u2019s Energy Management System. This management system supports our efforts to achieve a steady and consistent reduction in the environmental and energy impact of manufacturing processes.\n\nThe attainment of Stellantis\u2019 GHG emissions reduction targets are founded on five fundamentals, which are already well-established:\n\n- Being mindful of regulatory compliance and transparency in relationship with administration bodies\n- Involving staff at all levels of the organization\n- Rolling out an Energy Management System at the manufacturing sites, taking into account ISO 50001 and ISO 14001 requirements and recommending that suppliers maintain similar management systems\n- Implementing production methods which incorporate the best practices that have adopted low cost and energy efficient processes from the design stage onwards, covering various aspects of production (logistics, maintenance, production)\n- Employing shared best practices in these production methods to optimize consumption and emissions.\n\n**Main levers to reach carbon net zero for scopes 1 and 2**\n\n| PERIOD          | Levers                                                                 |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Short term 2025 | - Energy management in all plants                                      |\n|                 | - Energy efficient projects                                            |\n| Medium term 2030| - Site compression and improvement of industrial footprint             |\n|                 | - Use and production of renewable energies                             |\n| Long term 2038  | - Technical innovations (e.g., Hydrogen, Power to gas)                 |\n|                 | - CO\u2082 capture and storage                                              |\n|                 | - Compensation of residual emissions                                   |\n\nFor more information refer to 6.3.3\n\nStellantis plants ISO 50001 certified at the end of 2022 representing 74% of total energy consumptions\n2.6.2 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nEnergy Domain\n\nStellantis through its Stellantis Production Way (SPW) organization has implemented during 2022 a specific plan called \u201cSPW in action\u201d.\n\nThe purpose of the Energy Domain is to define, deploy and improve our Energy Management System: a system to monitor, control, and optimize the energy performance in our plants and in our buildings, based on continuous improvement.\n\nThree of the most important fundamentals of the domain are:\n\n- Energy Efficiency\n- Renewable Energy\n- Energy Business Club\n\nEnergy efficiency implies that we need to keep a constant eye on the energy consumption of every machine and all equipment. KWh is our main driver. Elimination of waste and losses will protect us against price volatility.\n\nThe use of Renewable Energy is a must to achieve our CO\u2082 emissions target announced in Dare Forward 2030. The implementation of solar panels is intended to support this goal.\n\nThe Energy Business Club is a forum where plants share their best practices. We identify the performance gap, deliver the benchmark, ranking the best plants and support the ambitious target setting.\n\nFacilities have a dedicated Site utility manager and a team in charge of the energy management system. Teams on site supported by central energy team, declare that around 220 people are involved.\n\nThey monitor energy consumption, conduct audits, identify potential savings and drive energy reduction projects.\n\nInvestment Initiatives\n\nIn 2022, more than \u20ac28 million versus \u20ac6.3 million in 2021 is invested in energy savings which is approximately \u20ac4.9 versus \u20ac1.1 in 2021 per vehicle produced.\n\nAll plants have CO\u2082 reduction targets and are required to present roadmaps to reach net zero emissions and present yearly progress.\n\nThe decision-making process which allows capital investments in carbon reduction projects takes carbon price into account as well as the alignment with the decarbonization goals.\nParticipation in the CO\u2082 emission allowance scheme\n\nEuropean regulation system\nStellantis is part of the CO\u2082 allowance trading plan implemented by European Directive No. 2003/87/EC, also called the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) regulation amended for combustion operations (heating and processes) of its largest plants and for two of its casting plants. There are 20 sites involved in the fourth phase of the CO\u2082 emission allowance plan scheduled from 2021 to 2030. Price per ton of CO\u2082 increased from \u20ac25 in 2019 to around \u20ac80 in 2022. Stellantis expects a further price increase in the upcoming years.\n\nCanadian regulations system\nCanadian Carbon Emissions Levy: Federal Output Based Pricing System (OBPS).\nA carbon levy program that imposes \u201ccarbon\u201d costs on all fossil fuel-based energy consumption across Canada.\nStellantis two Assembly Plants and Casting Plant located in Canada do not pay for a significant portion of their carbon emissions under an OBPS program design feature intended to protect Emissions-Intensive and Trade-Exposed industry (EITE) and help businesses transition to the program. Unit Costs of Carbon rise every year from $20 Canadian dollars (CAD) (\u20ac13.50) in 2019 to $50 CAD (\u20ac36.50) per ton in 2022. The Ontario Provincial Emissions Performance System came into effect in 2022. The Emissions Performance Standard (EPS) will charge for Carbon emissions according to the Annual Emission Limit (AEL) which is the amount of allowable emissions in tons of CO\u2082-eq for each Automotive Facilities. AEL will be declining between 2022 and 2030 and is expected to continue to decline annually by 1.5% through to 2030.\nOBPS facilities will have to pay an increasing carbon cost for every ton of CO\u2082-eq over the AEL. The increase is expected to be $15 CAD (\u20ac10.95) every year (in line with the Federal program).\n\n2.6.3 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\nVehicle manufacturing uses energy for a wide range of industrial processes including casting, machining, paint curing, heat treatment, etc., as well as lighting and heating of buildings.\nStellantis has completed a thorough review of its energy consumption and energy efficiency across the Company. A consumption control plan was developed to map the performance of the largest plants in order to identify the lines of action necessary for a full overhaul of their energy patterns.\nThe plants continue to implement energy saving activities, based on the best practices shared between the two former companies. Each energy reduction project is validated based on its CO\u2082 impact and return on investment. Once validated and implemented at one of the Company\u2019s sites, initiatives that prove successful are gradually rolled out to all plants.\n\nFor more detail on the actions to reduce energy consumption in production processes refer to 2.6.3.2.1\nDue to the current geopolitical situation, the cost of energy has experienced a sharp rise in prices during 2022. To reduce the impact of this increase in energy costs, Stellantis has implemented a very aggressive consumption reduction plan. Especially in non-productive periods (e.g. weekends and holiday periods) a rigorous monitoring of energy consumption was carried out in particular through comparing between different plants and disseminating best practices. Beside regular energy efficiency action plan, additional actions made in recent years during the shutdown periods for Covid-19 crisis have been maintained and further implemented. The Energy Teams worked their way through each major energy using sub-system, such as compressed air, chillers, HVAC, boilers, lighting and process systems, to gain access to information concerning the idle condition of each of the systems. The Energy Teams used specific information gateways to those systems which could be interrogated remotely and analyzed. Many energy projects are in the phase study and some specific investments are already approved - e.g., a new biomass boiler will be in the operational phase during 2023 at the Trnava plant (Slovakia).\n\n2.6.3.1 Main achievements on GHG emission reduction\n\nIn 2022, Scope 1 emissions amounted to 1,526,757 tons of CO\u2082-eq versus 1,641,028 tons of CO\u2082-eq in 2021. The scope 1 has reduced of 7% thanks the less usage of natural gas, despite the inclusion in the reporting year of the CO\u2082 by fugitive emissions derived to unintentional releases during the use of refrigeration and air conditioning equipment. Scope 2 emissions amounted to 1,916,359 tons of CO\u2082-eq versus 2,233,459 tons of CO\u2082-eq in 2021. The scope 2 has reduced of more than 14% thanks to the increase in the use of renewable electricity. The CO\u2082 emitted resulted in 3,443,124 tons of CO\u2082-eq versus 3,874,486* tons of CO\u2082-eq emitted in 2021 this corresponds to 0.597 tons of CO\u2082-eq (Scope 1 + 2) per vehicle produced versus 0.681 tons of CO\u2082-eq in 2021.\n\n* Revised from 2021 Annual Report in the Non-Financial Information section.\nThe breakdown of GHG emission is as follows:\n\nby GHG, o/w direct, indirect market-based, incl. from renewable sources\n\n| SCOPE 1 EMISSIONS | 44% | 42% |\n|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| SCOPE 2 EMISSIONS | 56% | 58% |\n\nThis graph shows the scopes of CO\u2082 emissions for Stellantis facilities.\n\nPlacing short, medium and long-term quantitative targets on the share of electricity consumed from renewable sources enables Stellantis to define and track alignment with a clear roadmap of how to attain its Scope 1 and 2 CO\u2082 emissions reduction targets. By 2025, Stellantis will use 50% of electricity coming from renewable or decarbonized sources. The target is for the share to increase to 100% by 2030.\n\nIn 2022, the share of decarbonized electricity used by the Company amounted to 3,512 GWh versus 2,940 GWh in 2021. The percentage of decarbonized electricity resulted in 55 percent of the electricity consumed versus 45 percent in 2021, overachieving the initial 2025 target to use 50% of electricity coming from renewable or decarbonized sources. Decarbonized electricity includes renewable electricity (1,698 GWh) representing 27 percent of the total consumed electricity versus 18 percent (1,170 GWh) of the total consumed electricity in 2021.\n\nThe share of renewable electricity comes directly from electricity suppliers.\n\nThe 1,698,486 MWh of electricity consumed from renewable sources were generated by hydropower, solar power, biomass and wind power and from other renewable sources such as geothermal and marine power.\n\nA science-based roadmap for CO\u2082 Scope 1 and 2 emissions to reach Net Zero in 2038\n\nStellantis has defined its CO\u2082 emission reduction roadmap and targets for scopes 1 and 2 in accordance with Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) methodology and aligned with 1.5\u00b0C scenario.\n\nHaving 2021 as a baseline, the target is to reduce emissions from scope 1 and 2 by 50% in 2025, by 75% in 2030 and reaching carbon net zero, with single digit percent compensation of residual emissions, by 2038.\n2.6.3.2 Main initiative on GHG emission reduction\n\nThe following sections detail the initiatives that enable the majority of industrial and sites CO\u2082 emissions reductions.\n\n**ENERGY SCHEMES TO CUT CO\u2082 EMISSIONS**\n\n**LOW CO\u2082 ENERGY SCHEMES**\n\n- **100% GREEN ELECTRICITY CONTRACTS**\n  - Aspern (Austria); Teksid Aluminium, Itauna, Jaboat\u00e3o dos Guararapes (Brazil); Trnava (Slovakia); Grugliasco Mould Shop (Italy); Madrid, Vigo and Zaragoza (Spain).\n  - **129,534** tons of CO\u2082-eq avoided\n\n- **SOLAR SELF-GENERATED ELECTRICITY**\n  - Balocco and Pomigliano R&D Center, Cento, Pratola Serra, Mirafiori and Mopar European headquarter in Rivalta (Italy).\n  - **2,617** tons of CO\u2082-eq avoided\n\n- **SOLAR SELF-GENERATED HEAT**\n  - Pratola Serra (Italy)\n  - **2** tons of CO\u2082-eq avoided\n\n- **SOLAR ELECTRICITY GENERATED AT OUR SITES**\n  - Sochaux (France); Cassino (Italy); Kaiserslautern, R\u00fcsselsheim (Germany); Madrid, Zaragoza (Spain).\n  - Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) signed in Mangualde (Portugal); Zaragoza (Spain)\n  - **23,327** tons of CO\u2082-eq avoided\n\n- **WASTE HEAT FROM FOUNDRY PROCESS TRANSFERRED TO A NEARBY DISTRICT**\n  - Charleville-M\u00e9zi\u00e8res (France)\n  - **2,727** tons of CO\u2082-eq avoided\n\n**AVOIED CO\u2082 EMISSIONS**\n\n- **ZERO EMISSION ENERGY**\n  - Own consumption of renewable energy\n  - Self-generation of renewable energy\n  - Third party ownership and/or consumption of electricity generated at our sites\n\n- **OTHER CO\u2082 EMISSION REDUCTION PLANS ON STELLANTIS SITES**\n  - Waste heat from foundry process transferred to a nearby district\n\n**GRI 3-3**\n\n**GRI 305-5**\n2.6.3.2.1 Low-carbon energy consumption\n\nIn 2022, the plants in Itauna, Jaboat\u00e3o dos Guararapes, Porto Real (Brazil), Trnava (Slovakia), Aspern (Austria), Grugliasco Mould Shop (Italy), Madrid, Vigo and Zaragoza (Spain) sourced 100% green electricity. The 100% Green Electricity contracts led to the avoidance of 129,534 tons of CO\u2082-eq.\n\nStellantis has approved a new project supply for renewable electricity in Michigan (U.S.) through the DTE-MIGreenPower voluntary renewable energy program, developed with the supplier DTE Energy.\n\nThe project provides for the supply of 400 MWp of photovoltaic electricity guaranteed through a Virtual Power Purchase Agreement (VPPA) starting from 2026 at a latest. The signing of this contract represents an important step towards on the decarbonization of the manufacturing activities based in North America. Stellantis\u2019 CO\u2082 emissions will be reduced annually by approximately 670,000 tons of CO\u2082-eq. The agreement is subject to obtaining relevant regulatory approvals.\n\nIn South America, Stellantis works to measure, manage and reduce the annual GHG emissions produced by the daily activities of the plants through an emission inventory verified by third parties. The reduction of emissions is the result of the combination of actions focused on energy efficiency, use of energy from a renewable source and substitution of fossil fuel for ethanol and electricity in motor-propulsion.\n\nThe effort to reduce emissions gradually extends to the supply chain and dealership networks, through actions that seek to meet the objectives established in the Stellantis\u2019 long-term strategic plan Dare Forward 2030. Stellantis was also recognized by the Brazilian GHG Protocol Program with Gold Seal for the completion and certification of the GHG emissions inventory.\n\nCompleting an inventory of emission sources is a key step in the roadmap to achieving carbon net zero by 2038.\n\nThe wood furnace in the Vesoul (France) plant produced 20,087 MWh in 2022 (6,653 tons of CO\u2082-eq) by burning wood packaging waste generated on site.\n\nThis action reduces waste transportation and avoids fossil fuel emissions.\nIMPACT OF THE ELECTRIFICATION STRATEGY\n\nStellantis is driving its initiatives under consideration of local circumstances to identify most appropriate approach. In parallel to our electrification programs, initiatives for decarbonization of our facilities are being developed, as illustrated in the following example:\n\nEllesmere Port (UK) is on track to become Stellantis\u2019 first manufacturing site dedicated to battery electric LCV and passenger car models for Vauxhall, Opel, Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn. Stellantis has planned a \u00a3100 million (\u20ac114 million) investment, supported by the UK government, to secure an all-electric future for the plant. The goal at the Ellesmere Port plant is to be self-sufficient for electricity by mid-decade. The plant is currently being transformed and the production activities are planned to start again prior Q2 2023.\n\nStellantis has planned $3.6 billion CAD (\u20ac2.65 billion) investment for its Canadian Operations to accelerate electrification plans.\n\nAnnouncement supports company\u2019s long-term strategic plan Dare Forward 2030:\n\nWindsor Assembly Plant will be transformed to support production of a new multi-energy vehicle (MEV) architecture that will provide battery-electric capability for multiple models. The plant will have maximum flexibility to adjust production volumes as needed to meet changing market demand over the next decade.\n\nBrampton Assembly Plant will be retooled and fully modernized, the plant will introduce an all-new, flexible architecture to support the Company\u2019s electrification plans.\n\nThe upgrades at Tr\u00e9mery-Metz (France) strengthen Stellantis\u2019 powertrain manufacturing capabilities in battery electric, plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and hybrid vehicles, supporting society\u2019s need for clean, safe, and affordable mobility and easing the transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to BEVs.\n\nThrough investments in two key joint ventures at Tr\u00e9mery-Metz (France), Stellantis has deployed a vertical integration strategy designed to increase control of the global electrification value chain.\n\n2.6.3.2.2 Low-carbon energy generation\n\nTo increase the share of self-produced green energy, in 2021 Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) were signed in Zaragoza, Spain (23,000 MWh) and at the Manguade plant in Portugal (4,000 MWh). These contracts stipulated the installation of solar power panels on the plant premises. Electricity production started in 2021. Photovoltaic panels were installed with the support of the Company\u2019s partners in Sochaux (France), Kaiserslautern and R\u00fcsselsheim (Germany), Madrid and Zaragoza (Spain) plants. The CO\u2082 emissions reduction is estimated at 23,327 tons of CO\u2082-eq per year.\n\nThe self-production of renewable electricity at the Zaragoza plant is Spain\u2019s largest renewable self-generation project. The photovoltaic installation, developed and executed by Prosolia Energy, consists of 34,800 photovoltaic modules installed over a 163,000 m\u00b2 surface. The extended project\u2019s capacity, from 8.6 MW up to 16 MW, is sufficient to provide 30% of the plant\u2019s annual electricity consumption and achieve an additional reduction of 2000 tons of CO\u2082-eq. Therefore, Stellantis Zaragoza is capable of generating and obtaining its own \u201cclean\u201d energy, increasing its competitiveness in a market of rising electricity prices. At the same time, it fulfills its purpose of reducing carbon emissions,\navoiding more than 4.2 thousand tons of CO\u2082-eq. In addition, the Zaragoza plant is certified according to ISO 50001 standards and on the path to implementing the Stellantis Production Way sustainable efficiency model.\n\nIn Mirafiori plant, a photovoltaic system was installed with a total power of 5.1 MWp in the logistic parking area and occupies an area of approximately 27,000 m\u00b2. The project consists of approximately 12,000 photovoltaic panels and is able to produce yearly approximately 6,200 MWh avoiding around 2,800 tons of CO\u2082-eq per year.\n\nFurthermore, an ongoing project to install photovoltaic panels in the Vigo plant should eventually enable the self-generation of 17% of the plant\u2019s electricity needs. The capacity of the project is expected to reach 19 MWp in 2023. By 2030, the plant plans to rely on green hydrogen instead of natural gas for some of its industrial processes.\n\nIn addition deep geothermal projects are under investigation in R\u00fcsselsheim (Germany), Mulhouse and Caen (France). These projects represent a further step towards achieving our ambitious Dare Forward 2030 plan.\n\n2.6.3.3 Main achievements on energy use reduction\n\nStellantis total energy consumption during the year amounted to 15,495 GWh versus 16,058 GWh in 2021. Overall, energy consumption decreased by 3.5% with a production level that increased by about 1.4%.\n\nThis amounts to 2.7 MWh per vehicle produced versus 2.8 MWh per vehicle produced in 2021.\n\nThe breakdown of energy consumption is as follows:\n\nEnergy GRAPH (by source)\n\n| Source                  | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|\n| HEAVY FUELS             | 0.39%  | 0.003% |\n| NG + LPG                | 50.80% | 52.14% |\n| COKE                    | 0.90%  | 0.90%  |\n| BIOMASS (WOOD)          | 0.13%  | 0.11%  |\n| ELECTRICITY (NOT RENEWABLE SOURCES) | 30.37% | 33.12% |\n| ELECTRICITY (RENEWABLE SOURCES) | 10.96% | 7.28%  |\n| STEAM + COOLING         | 6.45%  | 6.45%  |\n\nThis graph shows the sources of energy consumed in Stellantis facilities. This representation allows comparison with data from other manufacturers in the sector without casting operations.\n2.6.3.4 Main initiatives on energy use reduction\n\nIn light of the environmental challenges related to GHG emissions, despite the fact that industrial GHG emissions represent a relatively small portion of the vehicle\u2019s carbon footprint throughout its life cycle, the Manufacturing Division continued its effort on its own strategy towards reduced energy consumption and a carbon free environment within a given time period.\n\nStellantis focused on energy efficiency projects and initiatives as an integrated part of the CO\u2082 decarbonization strategy. In 2022 Stellantis approved energy efficiency projects for over \u20ac28 million in line with the Company\u2019s ambitious Dare Forward 2030 plan.\n\nAs part of the Company merger, we used the opportunity to learn from former PSA and FCA companies by sharing best practices on a global level. Significant energy and emission reduction projects are shared in the next section.\n\n2.6.3.4.1 Energy efficiency in buildings\n\nLighting\n\nLighting retrofits were implemented at numerous plants around the globe and included innovative lighting designs which utilized the latest LED lighting and control technology for enhanced operations. Collectively, these projects were an investment of \u20ac3 million with a provided benefit of \u20ac2.1 million. Some of the largest retrofits that took place included investments implemented in particular in Atessa (Italy), Windsor Assembly Plant (Canada), Goiana (Brazil) and Tichy Assembly Plant (Poland). The cumulative energy reduction makes it possible to reduce CO\u2082-eq emissions around 6,000 tons of CO\u2082-eq yearly.\n\nTemperature management\n\nStellantis has been heavily focused on controlling the temperature inside buildings. Numerous initiatives have been carried out in the production plants through the improvement of the control systems, the modernization and the improvement of the thermal insulation. Cumulative investments, in this important initiative, amounted around to \u20ac6.5 million, reaching \u20ac6.1 million in savings and CO\u2082-eq reductions of approximately 35,000 tons.\n\nSome of the largest initiatives regarding the upgrade of the energy management system to control wide heating, ventilation and air-condition (HVAC) took place in Windsor Assembly Plant and Etobicoke Casting Plant (Canada), Atessa (Italy), Tychy (Poland) and in the following U.S. manufacturing plants Detroit Assembly Complex, Sterling Heights and Warren.\n\nInsulation\n\n- Insulation of building supports the reduction of energy consumption as for example for the structural renewal of building facade in Szentgotth\u00e1rd (Hungary).\n2.6.3.4.2 Energy efficiency in production processes\n\nGiven that the energy consumed during the manufacturing process represents the majority of Stellantis\u2019 energy consumption, Stellantis focus specifically on this process for the reduction of energy costs and for the achievement of objectives Dare Forward 2030.\n\nCompressed Air\n\nThrough the following investments made which overall amount to \u20ac1.2 million we reached economic savings of \u20ac2.1 million and around 4,000 tons of CO2-eq.\n\n- In Pratola Serra (Italy) the compressor room was renewed with the installation of a new centrifugal compressor and a new dryer.\n- In Mulhouse (France) with the installation of a dedicated energy management system to optimize compressed air production in the compressor station.\n- In Poissy (France) with the reduction of the compressed air consumed and the implementation of heat recovery.\n- In Bielsko-Biala (Poland) and Porto Real (Brazil) through a leak reduction program both during production and non production period.\n\nHigh Efficiency Motors & Variable frequency drives\n\nStellantis continues to invest on improving its efficiency in the usage of motors, ventilation and pumping systems by installing variable speed drives and replacing his electrical motors with high efficient motors in various plants. The cumulative investments represent more than \u20ac2 million reaching saving around \u20ac2 million and saved 6,500 tons of CO2-eq.\n\nThese kind of investments were implemented in Madrid (Spain), Verrone, Pratola Serra, Cassino and Pomigliano (Italy), Cordoba and Palomar (Argentina), Manguade (Portugal) and Windsor Assembly Plant (Canada).\n\nProcess Optimization\n\nIn the field of process optimization, Stellantis has planned in 2022 investments around \u20ac16 million related to 70 projects around the world. More than half of the investments will be implemented in the painting process which represents the higher energy consumption.\n\nThese investments will result in cumulative economic savings of \u20ac15.6 million and a CO2 reduction of over 70,000 tons.\n\n- An upgrade of the painting process to 4 wet concept has been planned in Saltillo Van assembly plant (Mexico).\n- The first phase for the elimination of steam in the paint shop at Windsor assembly plant (Canada).\n- Investments were made in Hordain and Poissy (France) to optimize the air flows in the paint shop.\nAround 600 process improvement projects were completed in South America that reduced more than 49,000 MWh of electricity, 24,000 MWh of natural gas and around 8,800 tons of CO\u2082. Most of the energy savings from these projects were a result of plant process optimization and improved shutdown efforts.\n\nThe Sterling Heights Assembly Plant in Michigan (U.S.) was awarded first place in the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) 2022 Technology awards for their \u201cChiller Plant Optimization Project.\u201d The ASHRAE Technology Awards recognize: \u201coutstanding achievements by members who have successfully applied innovative building design in the areas of occupant comfort, indoor air quality and energy conservation.\u201d The main goals of optimizing energy consumption were the keys to the success of the project reaching the first place in the category \u201cIndustrial Facilities or Processes \u2013 Existing.\u201d\n\n2.6.3.4.3 Company policy or behavioral change:\n\nReal estate footprint\n\nIn 2022, the Real Estate Division continued to work on our footprint optimization for all Stellantis activities:\n\n- Evolution of use principles, geographical grouping of activities, maximizing use intensity, compaction (reduction of 1,845,752 m\u00b2). Collectively, these actions provided an estimate reduction of 53,527 tons of CO\u2082-eq. Real Estate committees integrate the environmental issues of projects into decision-making processes including improvement of energy efficiency in the major renovation projects of our dealership, financial support for energy retrofits of buildings and the implementation of renewable energy solutions.\n\nRetail activities also conduct optimization of energy consumption and CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nCarbon and energy impacts are integrated into all the phases of transformation and development of the network. The mutualization on single site multi brand activities or the intensification of the services activities on site, allows to reduce our footprint and to valorize our building by the renovation of our energy systems and the improvement of their control.\n\nExample: In 2022, the works for the Creation of the mobility factory on our historic site Nanterre (France) have started. This unique concept integrates a dealership, sales to companies\u2019 activities, a megastore for used vehicles and a center for light commercial vehicles.\n\nThe concept of four sites in one, allows the reduction of the surface by 59% m\u00b2. The works for this new project will need refurbishment, demolition of around 18,200 m\u00b2 and construction of 3,443 m\u00b2 and liberation of 18,300 m\u00b2.\n\nThe environmental requirement has been defined upstream of the project: decarbonized energy sources and energy performance better than regulatory thresholds (-30% versus requirements of the French thermal regulation 2012).\n\nFor all French dealerships and warehouses, which represent 40% of the scope, a process of energy supervision has been implemented in 2021 to support site managers and to share best practices. This new process allows to reduce by 10% of total energy consumption versus 2021.\nKey figures to illustrate the optimization of energy consumption and CO\u2082 emissions in France:\n\n- **LED solution on 20 sites**: an investment of \u20ac500 thousand and an annual saving forecast of 404 MWH electricity.\n- **Renovation heating equipment with low carbon energy instead of gas on six sites**: an investment of \u20ac353 thousand and an annual saving forecast of 354 tons of CO\u2082-eq.\n\nFor the other countries in Europe, a strong animation is deployed to implement actions in order to reduce the energy consumption and the carbon intensity, based on the two following pillars: Energy Sobriety and Efficiency \u2013 Use of low carbon sources.\n\nIn Poissy (France) and R\u00fcsselsheim (Germany), Stellantis plans to develop green campus for the national headquarters that will serve as role models for Stellantis with low-carbon concept and extensive \u201cgreening\u201d by 2025.\n\n- **Poissy** headquarters in France is expected to group together employees working in nearby sites in a 60,000 m\u00b2 campus. With this project, Stellantis expects to reduce its real estate footprint with a modern, vegetated site, using eco-design construction technologies to reduce CO\u2082 emissions.\n\n- **R\u00fcsselsheim** headquarters in Germany is expected to be transformed to minimize its carbon impact with a consistent low-energy concept and extensive use of solar panels on roofs. The headquarters is to be integrated into an historical building, allowing reduced use of resources compared to the construction of a completely new building. Stellantis integrates the great industrial tradition of the Company into its future site concept. The concept also integrates state-of-the-art equipment and allows easy accessibility.\n\nFeasibility studies are ongoing to possibly extend this Green Campus development to others Stellantis historical main footprint.\n\nThe initiatives implemented by Stellantis in 2022 resulted in an emission reduction in scope 1 and scope 2 for more than 123,000 tons of CO\u2082-eq equals (versus 49,924 in 2021) to 21.4 kg of CO\u2082-eq/vehicle produced (versus 8.8 kg in 2021).\n\nThe actions to control energy consumption led to savings of approximately \u20ac28 million. These figures are included in the vehicle production costs and affect the Stellantis\u2019 overall economic performance.\nAVERAGE PLANT ENERGY SPENDING AND (ELECTRICITY AND GAS)

emissions from all Stellantis industrial facilities including direct emissions from four cogeneration plants and has been calculated based on GHG Protocol standards.\n\nThe Company uses energy produced by cogeneration plants managed by two different approaches. In Melfi, Melfi Plastic, Cassino and Atessa (Italy), Sochaux, Rennes, Mulhouse and Hordain (France) plants have signed contracts with external suppliers which provide electricity, steam and hot water used in paint shop process. Three other cogeneration plants produce electricity and steam from gas. The energy produced is partly used in the plant, but a large part is also sold to other facilities or to external customers. The amount of gas used is 989,256 MWh LHV to produce 326,445 MWh of electricity and 441,059 MWh of steam. Electricity generated by cogenerations operated in Zaragoza, R\u00fcsselsheim and Eisenach has a lower CO\u2082-eq content than the national electricity mix from the grid and therefore contributes to CO\u2082-eq reduction. These scope 1 emissions of the energy sold increase the reported absolute emissions even though they were not caused by the production. The CO\u2082-eq from energy sold to external customers represents 76,222 tons in 2022.\n2.6.4.2 Breakdown of energy consumption from operations\n\nReported energy consumption is expressed in MWh LCV (the most common unit of measurement). In terms of method, the use of calorific values is recommended by the French decree of October 31, 2012 as part of the application of European regulation No. 601/2012 on the monitoring and declaration of greenhouse gas emissions under Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and Council. The coefficients proposed by these two regulations are derived from the work of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), as are those of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, used as a reference by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Following this approach, values expressed in MWh can be converted to GJ simply by applying a multiplying factor of 3.6 (1 Wh = 3.6 kJ).\n\n| (MWh) | Combustible energy | Non-combustible energy | Total energy consumption | Total energy consumption as % |\n|-------|--------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|       | Non-renewable | Renewable | Non-renewable | Renewable | Electricity | Renewable electricity produced and consumed | Of which decarbonized electricity | Share of decarbonized electricity (%) | Steam & Cooling | |\n|       | Heavy fuels | NG + LPG | Coke | Biomass (wood) | Electricity | | | | | |\n| Enlarged Europe | | | | | | | | | | |\n| 2022 | 53,949 | 3,307,277 | 78,263 | 20,087 | 2,995,071 | 4,525 | 2,160,240 | 72% | 996,109 | 7,455,281 | 48% |\n| 2021 | 561 | 3,928,611 | 76,121 | 16,895 | 2,985,282 | 1,759,576 | 59% | 1,034,074 | 8,041,544 | 50% |\n| North America | | | | | | | | | | |\n| 2022 | - | 3,929,455 | 61,570 | - | 2,670,931 | - | 999,720 | 37% | - | 6,661,956 | 43% |\n| 2021 | - | 4,063,762 | 68,883 | - | 2,742,931 | 1,001,723 | 37% | - | 6,875,756 | 43% |\n| South America | | | | | | | | | | |\n| 2022 | 3,645 | 328,560 | - | - | 556,005 | - | 272,819 | 49% | - | 888,210 | 6% |\n| 2021 | 343,766 | - | - | - | 589,166 | 156,048 | 26% | - | 932,932 | 6% |\n| Middle East & Africa | | | | | | | | | | |\n| 2022 | - | 28,945 | - | - | 36,315 | - | 6,576 | 18% | - | 65,260 | 0% |\n| 2021 | - | 34,699 | - | - | 34,315 | 6,217 | 18% | - | 69,014 | |\n| China and India & Asia Pacific | | | | | | | | | | |\n| 2022 | 682 | 1,328 | - | - | 15,148 | - | 4,982 | 33% | 1,371 | 18,529 | 0% |\n| 2021 | 1,509 | - | - | - | 9,397 | 5,455 | 55% | - | 11,446 | |\n| Total Manufacturing | | | | | | | | | | |\n| 2022 | 58,276 | 7,595,565 | 139,833 | 20,087 | 6,273,470 | 4,525 | 3,444,337 | 55% | 997,480 | 15,089,236 | 97% |\n| 2021 | 561 | 8,372,348 | 145,004 | 16,895 | 6,361,631 | 2,929,019 | 46% | 1,034,074 | 15,930,512 | 99% |\n| Retail | | | | | | | | | | |\n| 2022 | 2,696 | 269,737 | - | - | 131,257 | 1,230 | 67,503 | 52% | 735 | 405,655 | 3% |\n| 2021 | 253 | - | - | - | 126,519 | 11,053 | 9% | 925 | 127,697 | 1% |\n| TOTAL | | | | | | | | | | |\n| 2022 | 60,972 | 7,865,302 | 139,833 | 20,087 | 6,404,727 | 5,755 | 3,511,840 | 55% | 998,215 | 15,494,891 | |\n| 2021 | 561 | 8,372,601 | 145,004 | 16,895 | 6,488,151 | 2,940,072 | 45% | 1,034,999* | 16,058,210 | |\n\n1,169,776 MWh of electricity consumed were generated from renewable sources.\n\n* Revised from 2021 Annual Report in the Non-Financial Information section\n2.7 Carbon footprint of the supply chain: purchasing and logistics\n\nImproving the environmental performance of the supply chain is the third dimension of Stellantis\u2019 decarbonization strategy. The levers presented in this Chapter aim at supporting Stellantis to meet its objective of reaching carbon net zero with single-digit % of compensation over its entire supply chain in 2038.\n\nStellantis\u2019 responsible purchasing practices are presented in Chapter 7.1. This chapter focuses on environmental and climate-related aspects.\n\n2.7.1 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nReducing the Company\u2019s carbon footprint includes actions to reduce the CO\u2082 emissions related to:\n\n- purchasing, as the extraction of materials and the production of parts represents the second largest source of Stellantis\u2019 CO\u2082 emissions;\n- logistics, which represents a small portion of the carbon footprint of Stellantis.\n\nIn line with Dare Forward strategy, Stellantis GPSC has defined a target to reduce the carbon footprint of scope 3 upstream activities by -40% for electric vehicles compared to 2021 by 2030 and to reach carbon net zero with minimal compensation by 2038.\n\nThe Company has established a specific CO\u2082 requirement in its sustainable policy guidelines and has included the CO\u2082 performance as a criterion in its business award policy for the most intensive CO\u2082-emitting commodities that represent 80% of the CO\u2082 footprint of the supply chain.\n\nPurchasing\n\nSuppliers to Stellantis are deeply involved in the Company\u2019s approach to reducing CO\u2082 emissions in the supply chain, including the emissions generated for the production of goods and services purchased by Stellantis. Our strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the entire supply chain consists of:\n\n- selecting suppliers according to environmental criteria such as the ISO 14001 certification, or their capacity to develop products which incorporate green or recycled materials. As of December 31, 2022, 61% of direct material suppliers have ISO 14001 certifications;\n- collecting a status report from its 250 major suppliers on their current and future CO\u2082 emissions and implementing a reduction plan by inviting them annually to participate in the Stellantis CDP Supply Chain program. CDP is an organization which supports companies with the disclosure of environmental impacts. It aims to make environmental reporting and risk management a business norm while driving disclosure, insight and action towards a sustainable economy.\n\nStellantis\u2019 climate change objectives are translated into contractual commitments via specifications and purchasing policies according to two different criteria: CO\u2082 emissions reduction and the type of materials used.\nRegarding CO\u2082 emissions linked to the Company\u2019s purchases from suppliers, the Purchasing & Supply Chain division challenges its suppliers to establish and work according to an emission reduction plan at least compliant with the Paris Agreement and to be aligned with Stellantis climate ambitions. In 2022, 51% of the Company\u2019s suppliers set up a reporting process for energy consumption or greenhouse gas emissions. Stellantis is placing particular emphasis on CO\u2082 emissions linked to specific commodities covering around 80% of the CO\u2082 emission footprint of the supply chain.\n\nStellantis\u2019 No-Deforestation requirement to suppliers is incorporated into the Responsible Purchasing Guidelines available on the corporate website. Stellantis engages its suppliers globally to set out appropriate monitoring, traceability and action plans related to efforts to avoid deforestation.\n\nAmbitious targets have been set on the percentage of \u201cgreen/recyclable materials\u201d. These objectives are also a key focus of the innovation policy that is part of the Company\u2019s supplier certification criteria. Furthermore, suppliers also have a key role to play in our commitments on reducing hazardous substances.\n\nLogistics\n\nStellantis\u2019 logistics operations policy\n\nA specific policy is defined to reduce GHG emissions from logistics and identify areas of improvement and actions needed. The logistics operations are handled by a variety of external operators and a minority of internal operations, depending on the origin and destination of the goods. The Company has adopted internal logistics guidelines that provide direction on how to reduce logistics carbon footprint including methodologies to reduce the impact of freight and vehicle movement.\n\nThe Company\u2019s logistics approach focuses on the:\n\n- optimization of logistics flows regarding network, mode and capacity in addition to the adoption of low-emission transport vehicles in our own fleets to improve performance and minimize impacts on the environment:\n  - make efforts to use the least polluting transport methods available, in line with the most stringent environmental standards\n  - the Company is exploring and prioritizing alternatives to road transport by increasing the use of rail and river transport\n  - contractors comply with applicable legislation and regulations.\n\n- Requirement to suppliers for the use of recyclable or reusable packaging raw materials for new projects vehicles in Europe.\n\nEmployee travel policy\n\nStellantis undertakes policies to optimize employee mobility and reduce CO\u2082 emissions related to business travel. This approach encourages a more frugal approach to travel and supports alternatives to traditional individual transport. The Company is committed to limit travel to what is strictly necessary. The Company also focuses on the promotion of remote working, which reduces commuting.\n2.7.2 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nPurchasing\n\nMonitoring CO\u2082 emissions and GHG emissions of our supply chain is a major aspect of our responsible purchasing practices. It requires various internal and external resources and is deeply embedded in our management and tracking tools for CSR as well as the decision-making process.\n\nStellantis has started to use CO\u2082 performance of suppliers as a key factor in sourcing decisions. We are also utilizing the CDP Supply Chain module as CDP is the most recognized global carbon accounting initiative and has the biggest network and impact. This initiative promotes awareness among suppliers of their impact on the climate, particularly regarding greenhouse gas emissions and provides detailed information on the suppliers\u2019 level of emissions as well as reduction targets and commitments.\n\nFurthermore, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and CO\u2082 emissions are major subjects discussed in the Drive Sustainability Initiative, where Stellantis is a partner, as well as in various other Automotive industry groups in multiple countries.\n\nLogistics\n\nA specific environmental network in the Logistics Department in each of the 6 regions has to focus on the reduction of the logistics carbon impact and waste optimization roadmap. This network is composed of 10 logistic correspondents who are monitored at least quarterly in a Care CO\u2082 Business Club, has the target to:\n\n- improve the way of measuring logistics CO\u2082 emissions and waste impacts\n- analyze those impacts\n- set up process evolutions and monitor activities to reduce emissions and waste quality impact.\n\nIMPACT MEASUREMENT OF THE ELECTRIFICATION STRATEGY\n\nThe increase of Low Emission Vehicles (LEVs) strategy has two impacts on our logistics. The first one is on the sourcing of LEVs\u2019 component, which comes with an increase of our upstream distances. The solution to this impact is the creation of a battery gigafactory close to our plants already announced by Stellantis. The second impact is the increase of the LEVs weight, which bring a strong constraint on our trucks capacity thus affecting our loading rate on our downstream flow.\n2.7.3 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\n2.7.3.1 Initiatives to support the electrification strategy\n\nOver the next three years we intend to expand our electrification plan across all products and all Regions. We want to ensure the availability of our EV products for our customers and that means securing batteries and raw material supply. Working with suppliers that are best in class on environmental criteria enables Stellantis, as of 2022, to be engaged in 21 joint innovation projects with 19 suppliers to identify and implement technologies that reduce CO\u2082 emissions of the vehicles as well as in the production of parts. In order to secure the supply of critical materials needed to produce LEVs, it is necessary to have supporting contracts and relationships with our supply chain to procure the needed raw materials which will also reinforce the strategy for emissions reduction.\n\nIn addition, Stellantis\u2019 electrification strategy relies on battery repair and reuse, which could contribute to reducing CO\u2082 emissions from the raw materials and parts supply chain by decreasing the quantity of materials that needs to be purchased.\n\n2.7.3.2 Suppliers make a significant contribution to Stellantis\u2019 environmental targets\n\nMost suppliers in the automotive industry face the same environmental issues as Stellantis, which pushes them to reduce their carbon footprint and water consumption, managing their industrial waste, improving waste recycling and protecting biodiversity. Stellantis involves them in the efforts to monitor our environmental roadmap.\n\nAt this time the manufacturing of BEVs is more CO\u2082 intensive than the manufacturing of ICEVs, principally due to the production of the battery. Moreover, EV manufacturing uses more aluminum to reduce vehicle weight and therefore optimize their energy efficiency and their range. As a result, electrification, although it reduces significantly CO\u2082 emissions from the use of sold products, could lead to an increase in Stellantis\u2019 CO\u2082 emissions from the purchases of materials and parts.\n\nIn 2022, CO\u2082 emissions linked to purchases of materials and components correspond to 8.6% of Stellantis carbon footprint (versus 8.3% in 2021). Efforts carried out by Stellantis to integrate suppliers into our CO\u2082 emissions reduction ambitions are based on:\n\n- the integration of climate change in the supplier evaluation: as part of its responsible purchasing strategy, Stellantis assesses the supply base also on environmental criteria annually via the CDP Supply Chain Module as well as part of the EcoVadis process annually. In 2022, the average environmental score in EcoVadis of Stellantis suppliers was 54.6 outperforming all suppliers assessed by EcoVadis, which had an average score of 44.7. In 2022, 2,974 supplier groups were assessed, corresponding to more than 87% of the Annual Purchased Value. In case of insufficient performance or nonconformities, suppliers have to prove their actions in Corrective Action Plans, that get shared with Stellantis and monitored.\n\n- For 2023 the integration of CO\u2082-eq performance in the supplier selection is planned.\n\nFor new BEV projects we target 70 products, counting for 80% of the CO\u2082-eq footprint of the supply chain. Stellantis works on a CO\u2082-eq \u201ccradle-to-gate\u201d performance as a criteria for supplier selection.\nStellantis strives to integrate its suppliers in its decarbonization strategy, notably by encouraging them to set greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets compliant with the Paris Agreement. In 2022, more than 65 percent of our targeted suppliers had defined such trajectories (based on annual purchase value) versus 55 percent in 2021. The Company has established a specific CO\u2082 requirement in its sustainable policy guidelines and has included CO\u2082 performance as a criterion in its business award policy for the most intensive CO\u2082 emitting commodities that represent 80 percent of the CO\u2082 footprint of the supply chain. The share is then expected to increase to 95% by 2030 and to contribute to the carbon net zero with single-digit % of compensation objectives in 2038.\n\nIn addition, Stellantis\u2019 electrification strategy relies on battery repair and reuse, which could contribute to reducing CO\u2082 emissions from the raw materials and parts supply chain by decreasing the quantity of materials that needs to be purchased.\n\n- the collaboration of all major suppliers in the Stellantis CDP Supply Chain program. To promote and closely monitor awareness among suppliers of their impact on climate change, 250 suppliers have been invited to participate to the program in 2022. This program allows for a deeper understanding of several aspects including: the management, the targets and the results of individual CO\u2082 emissions of all major CO\u2082 emitting suppliers of Stellantis.\n\n- the deployment of an engagement campaign to educate suppliers about climate change: Stellantis considers all suppliers as partners which play a key role to reduce carbon emissions in the supply chain. Therefore, various ways of dialogue and training opportunities are offered to the supply base for CSR related matters, in particular on CO\u2082 emissions and GHG.\n\n- Maintaining dialogue with key suppliers: The company intensifies the dialogue on CO\u2082 with its key suppliers and key partners during annual business reviews with the biggest CO\u2082 contributors in the supply chain.\n\n- Organizing annual supplier awards event: Our very top Suppliers having a leading CSR Performance are annually recognized by our GPSC Top Leadership in the CSR category of our supplier award. The requirements and criteria for this award includes a strong CO\u2082 Performance, overall CSR Policy and Achievements. In 2022, the CSR Award winner, Aptiv was selected for its large contribution to the implementation of low emission vehicle technology as well as for its low CO\u2082 emissions in production.\n\nStellantis\u2019 2025 target is to monitor 80% (based on APV) of suppliers\u2019 CO\u2082 emissions through the Stellantis CDP Supply Chain program and dedicated actions from specific focus commodities.\n\n2.7.3.3 Reducing the carbon impact of logistics operations and travel\n\nStellantis is a global vehicle manufacturer and therefore manages thousands of flows on a daily basis, from sourcing supplies for its plants to delivering vehicles and spare parts to its clients. Stellantis\u2019 logistics operations are part of the scope 3 emission category.\n\nStellantis is working to define an ambitious trajectory for the carbon footprint of logistics operations that would be compliant with the Paris Agreement.\n\nSince they represent a minor portion of the logistics flows, internal logistics emissions are included in the scope 3 disclosure.\n2.7.3.3.1 Reducing the carbon impact of logistics operations\n\n**LOGISTIC FLOWS**\n\n**UPSTREAM FLOW**\n- Supplier Tier 1\n- Stellantis foundry sites\n- Stellantis engine and transmission sites\n- Stellantis assembly plant sites\n\n**DOWNSTREAM FLOW**\n- Planning process\n- Forecasts and orders\n- Independent dealership network\n- End customer\n- Integrated dealership network\n\n**PHYSICAL FLOW**\n- Upstream\n- Downstream\n- Spare parts\n- Information flow\n\n**SPARE PARTS**\n- Storage warehouses\n\n**SUPPLIER**\n- Tier 1\n\n**STELLANTIS**\n- Foundry sites\n- Engine and transmission sites\n- Assembly plant sites\n\n**INTEGRATED DEALERSHIP NETWORK**\n- End customer\n\n**INDEPENDENT DEALERSHIP NETWORK**\n- End customer\nActions undertaken by Stellantis\n\nThis table presents examples of actions undertaken from both companies.

We firmly believe that employees should feel valued and respected. We encourage an environment of inclusivity, celebrating the differences that our employees bring to work every day.\nWe are cultivating performance, continuous learning and permanent development with a high level of creativity and inspiration based on positive employee experiences. With meritocracy as a key rule, we recognize and reward success.\n\nBased on a constructive and responsible social dialogue, we aim to lead the changes and unleash new expertise in technologies and services to offer competitive mobility solutions to our customers for a greater future.\n\nStellantis launched a global employee survey in 2022 to get regular global and local data relative to engagement, sustainability, wellbeing, diversity and inclusion. The objective is to identify our strengths and drive improvements based on an employee data centric approach. In 2023 we will conduct two global employee surveys leveraging this tool to achieve our ambition of making Stellantis a great company to work for.\n\n3.1 Management of Company transformations and social dialogue\n\n3.1.1 CONTEXT AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\nCSR issue/challenge #4: Management of Company transformations and social dialogue\n\nThrough the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, our objective is to evolve from a legacy automaker to a sustainable mobility tech Company. Anticipation and development of skills helps the organization to identify the best match between future needs and current resources. This challenge needs the support and ability of all employees and employee representatives to change. Stellantis promotes and supports co-constructive, trustful and responsible social dialogues with employee representatives at each level of the Company. In this way, management and employee representatives can tackle the major ongoing and upcoming challenges together and provide economic and social performance for a sustainable future.\n\nTo support its objectives, Stellantis will leverage the following actions:\n\n- continuously improve our organization, with more agility and efficiency to fit business needs;\n- increase care for social climate and make the social dialogue a competitive advantage and the lever to support Company performance;\n- implement a sustainable transformation due to a common approach to develop and evaluate skills;\n- become a sustainable mobility tech Company through our employee journey and accelerate the transformation.\nSocial Dialogue\n\nAt Stellantis, employee representatives are fully engaged and involved at global and local level. We have dedicated meetings for sharing a clear vision of the current and upcoming situation and the strategy, to protect the Company and its employees. Our goals are managing the transformations linked to market changes and regulation and together, paving the way to a sustainable future.\n\nOur co-construction approach with our social partners to anticipate and manage upcoming transformation is a pillar we have implemented since the beginning of the merger through collective agreements.\n\nActions in 2022:\n\n- We signed 582 collective agreements (versus 467 in 2021) with 88% of our countries covered (versus 86% in 2021).\n- We have the strong ambition to assign in 2023 as pillar of a Sustainable Transformation framework agreement addressing:\n  - commitment to fundamental human rights\n  - commitment to environmental protection\n  - corporate social responsibility\n  - co-construction with social partners\n  - developing skills and employability\n  - being a magnet for talent\n  - acting for our employee\u2019s wellbeing, health and engagement\n  - diversity and equal opportunities\n  - embracing new ways of working that develop greatness\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nThe automotive sector is going through a significant transformation, ranging from electrification to the integration of artificial intelligence in autonomous driving. At Stellantis, we believe that social dialogue is key to the transformation taking place within the Company, supporting this change in a responsible way and engaging our workforce. Our employee representatives participate in dedicated meetings to discuss how to protect the Company and its employees by managing the risks linked to market changes and regulations. By involving and sharing a clear vision of the current and upcoming situation, the employee representatives are involved in paving the way to a sustainable future.\n3.1.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\nCommitment scoreboard\n\n| CSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE | VISION/AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | RESULTS |\n|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|---------|\n| Management of company transformations and social dialogue | Implement co-construction with trustful and transparent social dialogue with employee representatives and stakeholders to continuously develop and prepare the Company for future challenges | % of countries* covered by collective agreements | Short-term: 2024: 90% | 2022: 88% |\n| | | | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan): 2030: 95% | 2021: 86% |\n| | | | Long-term: 2040: 100% | |\n\n* Countries with over 150 employees\n\n3.1.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nSocial relations and workforce management are key success factors for involving and engaging employees in an Environment Social Governance (ESG) process and to realize the Company\u2019s transformation. Against this background, risks and opportunities were identified.\n\n3.1.3.1 Risks\n\n- Regulations and industry changes are creating unprecedented requirements for specialized talent, for example related to cybersecurity and carbon neutrality, including CO\u2082.\n- High inflation and the insecurity of our staff\n- Operational risks:\n  - lack of availability of specialized skills, skills assessment and inventory;\n  - lack of attractiveness and speed at enriching the Company with new competencies needed for the coming challenges;\n  - decisions to conclude the working relationship with employees that are not aligned with the market-led and regulatory transformations of the Company, can cause social issues (e.g., social demonstrations, complaints provided by employee representatives);\n  - not having the support from social partners, the speed of transformations could be hampered, which is key to maintaining our market competitiveness. Threat to our reputation in the event of strikes, social movements, dismissals, legal actions, employee unsatisfaction, etc., as a result not achieving the changing needs of the operational merger implementation and synergies execution. (e.g., department definition and boundaries).\n3.1.3.2 Opportunities\n\n- **Availability of skills and competencies:**\n  - accelerate Stellantis transformation fostering agility, continuous improvement and innovation;\n  - anticipate changes and equip employees with competences required to succeed;\n  - achieve sustainable performance aligned with new business needs and trends;\n  - making best use of existing human capital with strong skills background and recruit for game-changing new fields.\n\n- **Diversity of skills, engine to power the transformations:**\n  - contribute to the global distribution of competencies, with the new way of working, New Era of Agility, by having the right skills at the right time and place to support the business strategies of the Company.\n\n- **Innovative social dialogue:**\n  - co-construction through innovative Collective Bargaining Agreement;\n  - reassurance on the Company\u2019s ability to manage transformation through social dialogue to facilitate its relationships with unions and public authorities.\n\n- **Implementation of our purposes \u201cwinning together\u201d and \u201ccaring for the future\u201d, both for the employees and the Company.**\n\n- **The highly competitive and committed team from the merger leverages its combined skills and diverse backgrounds to guide Stellantis to become a great company to work for.**\n\n- **More efficient organization** by simplification and redesign to decrease bureaucracy and provide more agility to our employees.\n\n**IMPACT MEASUREMENT OF THE ELECTRIFICATION STRATEGY**\n\nOur electrification process relies on a strong inclusive strategy, among others battery repair and reuse. It will create workforce opportunities for our five gigafactories managed through dedicated Joint Ventures, 21 e-repair centers, and a battery expertise center in R\u00fcsselsheim, Germany. These new opportunities will be used to ensure the workforce transition from Internal Combustion Engine vehicles (ICE) to Electric Vehicles (EV). Stellantis is supporting this workforce transition by training and offering skill enhancement to employees to assist them with their chosen professional paths internally or externally.\n3.1.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nThe Chief Human Resources and Transformation Officer (CHRTO) is part of the ESG Committee to assist, advise and act under authority delegated by the Board of Directors with respect to ESG. For Human Resources and Labor Relations at Stellantis, the CHRTO sets and enforces a global Stellantis Social Relation strategy approved by the Top Executive team.\n\nThe Chief Human Resources and Transformation Officer is involved in strategic decisions taking the human factor into account. This is a necessary condition to establish a quality and proactive social dialogue. By finding the right balance between corporate and local needs, the global operating model supports further integration of diversity in the Company. In this way, local needs are considered, while consistent and cohesive actions are taken. Local collective agreements are led by the regions or countries which take global Company policies into account and reflect local particularities.\n\nTo get a global social overview, social climate monitoring was implemented in each region or country with the objective to provide insight, create common understanding, allow forecasting on a corporate level and define further action plans, as needed. Each month, HR representatives from about 30 countries participate in a poll and share information about working rhythms and atmosphere, manufacturing, engineering, sales, and Union activities and local policies. These criteria enable sharing the state of the social climate from within the workforce to allow for actionable planning and preparedness.\n\nThe Chief Human Resources and Transformation Officer is responsible for the oversight of the Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining. The CHRTO is a member of the Strategy Council and the owner of the strategic ESG issue \u201cManagement of company transformations and social dialogue\u201d.\n\nCo-construction is the approach promoted by the Company to build a responsible relationship based on trust and transparency and aimed at reconciling economic and social performance by implementing the most appropriate and pragmatic solutions. With this objective in mind, active dialogue was maintained in 2022 with various employee representation bodies at the national or transnational level. In Europe, through the European Works Councils of PSA, Fiat and Opel Vauxhall or in North America UAW (U.S. Union) or Unifor (Canadian Union) whose mandates are respected. Through the Special Negotiation Body, we will continue to create our employees\u2019 representatives Stellantis community by negotiating the future Stellantis European Works Council by the end of 2023.\n\nThe approach of co-construction through social dialogue is held as a competitive advantage for the Company in a more and more demanding environment. The notice period provided to employees and their elected representatives regarding significant operational changes is regulated either by local legislation or through collective bargaining agreement. The Company fully complies with both legislation and Collective Bargaining Agreements. Stellantis promotes and implements exchange with social partners regarding any significant operational changes to find the most appropriate solution in a responsible manner.\nThe Stellantis Social community is set up by leveraging on local and regional employee representatives (e.g. UAW, European Works Council) and worldwide events on the Dare Forward 2030 plan and HR strategy as foundations of the future of Stellantis.\n\n**Employees Covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement***\n\n(Stellantis worldwide)\n\n| Year | Number of employees covered | % of employees covered |\n|------|-----------------------------|------------------------|\n| Blue collars | | |\n| 2022 | 172,214 | 97% |\n| 2021 | 162,173 | 97% |\n| White collars | | |\n| 2022 | 60,802 | 74% |\n| 2021 | 58,952 | 65% |\n| Total | | |\n| 2022 | 233,016 | 89% |\n| 2021 | 241,125 | 87% |\n\n* Countries with more than 150 employees\n\nIn 2022, 582 collective agreements were signed worldwide and 97% of Company blue collar workers are covered by a collective bargaining agreement at sectoral and/or Company level.\n\nTo identify and develop the appropriate and diverse skills needed to be the front runner in tech leadership, we implemented strong governance and resources dedicated to the know-how evolution strategy.\n\n### 3.1.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nThe Stellantis social relations strategy is based on six commitments:\n\n- Stellantis supports the principles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the right to work without discrimination for just remuneration.

The recently formed Human Rights Committee, the designation of a Chief Human Rights Officer, together with our Human Rights Policy, are examples of the Company\u2019s focus on human rights.\n\n- The Responsible Purchasing Guidelines and the Stellantis Human Rights Policy seek to align with the human rights principles embodied in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Modern Slavery Act 2015.\n\n- As a signatory of the UN Global Compact and supporter of the ILO Principles, Stellantis considers environmental and societal impacts in its decision-making processes in a 360-degree approach, sharing values and requirements with suppliers, subcontractors, industrial partners and dealer networks.\n\n- Stellantis reinforces its commitment to global principles with an addition focus on compliance with related local legislation, such as the French Duty of Vigilance and the UK\u2019s Modern Slavery Act.\n\n- Incorporated in our recently launched compliance questionnaire, we monitor responses of individuals to determine if they are aware of any human rights risks or violations.\n\n- Our various due diligence processes also are designed to alert us with regards to potential violations in by our suppliers or other business partners on a risk-based basis.\n\n- Stellantis performs a global audit focused on human rights targeting specific legal entities on a risk-basis in order to assess the internal control system concerning the human rights process.\n\n**Human Rights Audit Coverage (at the end of September 2022)**\n\n| Number | % |\n|--------|---|\n| Human Rights audit Coverage (Total workforce) | 188,556 | 71% |\n| Headcount with Issue Noted (white collars only) | 52,015 | 28% |\n\nStellantis performs a global audit focused on human rights - targeting specific Legal Entities on a risk-basis in order to assess the internal control system concerning human rights on issues such as child and forced labor, high risk countries/areas of corruption or conflict, responsible supply chain sourcing, training and communication internally and to suppliers based on our yearly assessment. Findings from the 2022 Human Rights Audit identified areas of improvement as training processes, communication, access to policies and procedures. In total 11 action items for the findings were issued and supported by our governance-related policies and controls, including our Company\u2019s Code of Conduct, Integrity Helpline and various communication campaigns on internal websites. In 2023, we will continue to work with outside consultants to update our 2022 assessment to ensure human rights issues are prioritized, validated and reported regularly to the Stellantis Ethics and Compliance Committee and to the Board of Directors Audit Committee quarterly.\nSecurity personnel\n\nExternal service providers often provide the security personnel that protect many of our sites. As with other suppliers, we require such service providers to follow our Global Responsible Purchasing Guidelines. They are asked to pledge their commitment to fulfill their responsibility toward respecting human rights, cascading it throughout their entire supply chain. Internal security personnel need to fulfill the mandatory trainings as all other employees.\n\n3.1.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nThe Company aims to have relevant employee representative bodies at all levels (global, regional, local) enabling them to share implementation of the Company\u2019s strategic plan across all regions and to conduct an efficient dialogue with employee representatives.\n\nTo implement and support the co-construction approach over the whole Company, a four-level organization has been implemented as follows:\n\n- corporate labor relations division;\n- regional labor relations leader in each region;\n- country labor relations leader in each main country (U.S., France, Italy, Germany, Brazil);\n- local labor relation experts within the plants or sites.\n\nStellantis dedicates more than 300 employees fully to manage the social relation and HR specialists who support on the field the right management of the social climate. Moreover, a dedicated training session was held on social relation during the Team2Win training program. This worldwide training program include team leaders, supervisors, shift and plant managers.\n\nStellantis focuses on ensuring a global approach for skills transformation, leveraging on global job families\u2019 policy and proper ramp-up plans and on setting up a global network of expertise as a lever to be front runner in tech leadership. The job family approach provides a worldwide and cross-functional jobs and skills foundation for Stellantis, which is fully integrated with talent management and learning policies. This foundation of jobs and skills is based on internal and external data. Through Human Resources analytics facilitation, job roles and required skills are customized and finally validated by a Job Family and Human Resources stakeholders network.\n\nA job family consists of a set of common skills and jobs with the same business purpose. Each job family is split in a specific set of activities called \u201cprofessions\u201d (100 different professions), requiring the mastery of skills, tools and standardized processes. All employees are assigned to a profession and a job family allowing a job and skills driven mapping, cross-functional to the organization.\n\nTo enable a cross-organization policy to develop and evolve skills for each global job family, governance is set up with key stakeholders.\n### JOB FAMILIES GOVERNANCE\n\n| GOVERNANCE | MISSION / DELIVERABLES |\n|------------|------------------------|\n| **Top Management Sponsor** | Validate job family vision |\n| **Job family Leader** | Define priorities, validate proposals and give orientation for the job family |\n| **HR job families Coordinator** | Accountable for coordinating and ensuring proper implementation for the job families processes, supporting Job Family leader and Profession managers: Job catalog and key jobs, technical skills and learning offer, strategic domains and skills, typical career path, future needs |\n| **Profession Manager** | Main accountabilities: build and approve the job catalog identifying key jobs, core technical skills development needs and learning roadmap validation, identify the strategic changes impacting the profession, express future needs of skills and employment, define the standards and best practices at the global level, set up their network of expertise. |\n| **Expertise Network (Fellow and Senior Fellow)** | Accountable with profession managers to define and support future trends, Company performance and technical knowledge and awareness for the technical domains with the highest level of innovation and technology |\n\n#### WORLDWIDE\n\n- **Regional Network and Skills correspondent**\n  - Guided by Profession Managers, accountable to help deploying the professions orientations and bring up local inputs from Regions\n\n- **Regional HR job families**\n  - Engaged by Global HR job families coordinator, to provide guidance for the local implementation and to ensure job families processes development thanks to local HR network involvement\n\n#### REGIONAL\n\n- **15** global job families involving all white collar employees\n- **100** different professions\nAs a key asset of the job family approach is the set up of a global employee collective expertise community, gathering 6 distinguished fellows, 54 senior fellows and 254 fellows in specific areas of competencies (domains of expertise), designed to strengthen the evolution of the highest level skills in the most technical and technological domains to support know-how development as Innovation and Implementation activities (~300 white collar).\n\nThis community, managed together with the Chief Human Resources Transformation Officer and the Chief Technology Officer, has the aim of:\n\n- concretely acting to strengthen the best technical know how in the Company ensuring the proper development of the most technical domains;\n- being the point of reference for supporting our Company performance, becoming the \u201cgo-to person\u201d to find the most efficient and innovative solutions;\n- developing the ability in forecasting changes to secure sustainability for the business;\n- building a world-wide expertise network, powered by Stellantis diversity, with an inclusive environment in which providing value to the whole innovative ideas and know-how.\n\nThis community will play a key role for research and experimentation, external relationships, and partnership to develop technical know-how aligned with the Dare Forward 2030 strategy.

We share the challenges and the consequence of the data and energy transition with the willingness to have a common understanding and the construction of the path to achieve the transition to a sustainable mobility tech company. Regarding skills management, the anticipation of future needs is a critical element. The Job Family approach and expertise network is a solution to manage the required operations and ensure a leadership position within the automotive industry. Furthermore, a budget has been allocated to retrain or reskill people who used to have jobs no longer pursued. This is managed via two specific academies.\n\n**Work with communities**\n\nThroughout several divisions among others Manufacturing, Human Resources and Communications Stellantis is in contact with its surrounding communities. We act in a sustainable manner and aim for adding value in the communities in which we are active. This exchange is adapted to the regional and cultural needs and laws, indigenous rights and depending on the project itself, including employee representatives and/or local trade unions. Often the open dialogue allows finding the most creative and helpful ideas. Our collaboration ranges from:\n\n- supporting events by providing corporate infrastructure;\n- rural development;\n- education promotion, promotion of learning projects providing buildings, material or lessons and infrastructure;\n- joint clean-up operations;\n- integrative projects of various population groups.\n- health and hygiene and Environment Protection.

The CLPI, which is deployed based on the Company\u2019s economic performance, is distributed among the countries involved on a shared basis and is paid out according to terms defined by each country based on collective economic performance achievement criteria. The CLPI is progressively being implemented in countries with no profit-sharing program. To the economic performance criterion of operating margin, a criterion on quality results has been added. In addition to this fixed and variable compensation, there is an individual bonus plan based on company, region or division and individual performance.\n\nIn line with our co-constructive approach, agreements are communicated in different ways, also depending on local laws. Sometimes they are shared in government databases, intranet, email to all employees, etc. Unions can introduce themselves to new employees and can contact employees via the e-mail distribution list. In general, regular meetings are organized with local unions and/or employee representatives where the Human Resources and Transformation (HRT) team timely address any issues and issues raised by either side. For example, workplace inspections and the preparation of risk assessments for reasons of occupational safety or complaints procedures due to discrimination (gender, age, ethnicity, etc.) are dealt with in cooperation with trade unions and employee representatives. Some of the issues or raised cases can be solved easily, others may be investigated by the Audit & Compliance team, but eventually specific issues can also be referred to external mediation.\n\nIt is an important component for Stellantis. It aims to anticipate and support the Company\u2019s transitions by incorporating the human dimension, consequently helping to create a harmonious labor environment. One major strike took place within Stellantis in 2022 according to the definition of SASB-310a.2. In total 10 strike events (versus 13 in 2021) occurred corresponding to 10.5 days (versus 13 days in 2021).\nA globally established program to comply with Human Rights as well as its Diversity and Inclusion commitments and Wellbeing, Health and Safety policy is the Stellantis Integrity Helpline.\n\n- The Whistleblowing Policy embodied in our Integrity Helpline allows for any violation of Stellantis Code of Conduct and compliance rules to be reported and received securely and confidentially, and to be processed and managed properly. This system is open to employees, employee representatives, suppliers and other stakeholders. Stellantis is committed to handling claims and complaints that are raised and ensuring due diligence with suppliers in the supply chain. Reports may be made anonymously unless local law provides otherwise. The confidentiality of the individual(s) involved in a case is paramount, and no external party is involved unless absolutely necessary to resolve a case and then only with appropriate confidentiality safeguards.\n\n- The Company expects that all persons in the workplace will be treated with dignity, their rights respected and their privacy maintained. The Integrity Helpline can be used to report any violation of fundamental human rights. Concerns are handled in accordance with the Stellantis Integrity Helpline - Whistleblowing Policy, applicable to all Stellantis companies and managed pursuant to local regulations.\n\n- Each report is reviewed and when appropriate, triggers an internal investigation. The investigations are conducted with neutrality and respect in order to check and verify the facts. Behaviors that, after investigation, are concluded to violate our Code of Conduct can be subject to disciplinary measures that are proportional to the seriousness of the offense. These processes allow vigilance over the Company\u2019s \u201cimpacts\u201d on its stakeholders.\n\n- Any criticality arising from the concerns received are analyzed and specific corrective action plans implemented. Furthermore, a dedicated training, communication and awareness campaign was delivered to ensure that all employees are aware of how to behave to prevent the recurrence of such critical issues. Specific to 2022, communication campaigns and training courses related to the prevention of phishing, fraud, anti-corruption and discrimination were rolled-out.\n\n- Action plans are monitored and verified to ensure that deadlines agreed upon with the owners are respected (postponement requests must be authorized by the Audit and Compliance department). The action plans are validated by the hierarchical managers of those responsible for the implementation of actions (overall responsible) and submitted for validation from the regional and global Ethics and Compliance Committees (ECC). The ECC reviews all the closure of all reports and their action plans. The implementation of the actions is declared by the owners, who, on the due date, declare implementation by attaching the necessary information to support closure.\n\n- The owners of the action may be from various business functions, depending on the finding/action to be implemented.\n\n- Audit and Compliance conducts follow up audits to verify the actual closure of the most significant actions.\n\nIn 2022, 1,862 issues (versus 1,524 in 2021) were reported via the Stellantis Integrity Helpline. All cases are investigated via the Company\u2019s Integrity Helpline - Whistleblowing Policy, with increased awareness of the employees through more communication. An investigation is carried out systematically with actions taken based on the conclusions.\n### Number of cases reported via the Integrity Helpline\n\n| Protecting our Workforce | Conducting Business | Interacting with External Parties | Managing our Assets and Information | Total |\n|--------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------|\n| Harassment and Internal Working Environment | Corruption, Bribery, Lobbying and Gifts | Data Privacy | Other | |\n| Discrimination and Retaliation | | | | |\n| Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) | | | | |\n| No of reported cases received in 2022 | 1,007 | 29 | 15 | 24 | 67 | 314 | 1,862 |\n| Total cases closed in 2022 | 877 | 13 | 12 | 27 | 88 | 323 | 1,722 |\n| No of cases closed in 2022 as substantiated or not substantiated with issue | 280 | 5 | 4 | 13 | 36 | 173 | 575 |\n| Number of cases archived in 2022 | 189 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 6 | 30 | 286 |\n| No of cases still open in N (as of 31/12/2022) | 379 | 21 | 5 | 9 | 38 | 100 | 760 |\n| No of closed cases 2022 with actions taken | 326 | 6 | 7 | 15 | 37 | 205 | 678 |\n| Duplicate cases received in 2022 | 76 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 7 | 114 |\n\nIn addition, Stellantis is dedicated to abiding by laws and regulations and to preventing disputes. 10,705 employment grievances were filed in 2022; 1,641 of them were filed with an official external body (court, employment tribunal, public mediation body, etc.) and 9,064 were filed according to an internal procedure. 1,494 grievances were settled by a court or external body during the year.\n\n### Labor grievances resolution\n\n| Year | Total |\n|------|-------|\n| Grievances filed in court during the year | 1,641 |\n| 2022 | 1,501 |\n| 2021 | |\n| Grievances filed internally during the year | 9,064 |\n| 2022 | 4,279 |\n| 2021 | |\n| Grievances resolved by a court or external body during the year | 1,494 |\n| 2022 | 1,822 |\n| 2021 | |\n| Of which decision of favor of the company | 544 |\n| 2022 | 571 |\n| 2021 | |\n| Of which internal remediation with settlement agreement | 219 |\n| 2022 | 116 |\n| 2021 | |\n| Of which conviction of the company | 731 |\n| 2022 | 1,227 |\n| 2021 | |\nThe Company did not identify any incident of violations involving the rights of indigenous peoples during the reporting period.\n\nIn support of the social dialogue and underlining the connection with the communities Stellantis engaged in two more activities, namely the Global Employee Volunteerism Program and the Stellantis Student Awards.\n\n- A historical program the Stellantis Student Awards \u2013 formerly the Sergio Marchionne Student Achievement Awards \u2013 is rooted in our strategic plans and programs, supporting education and continued learning as critical functions to a sustainable future. The Awards are open to all Stellantis Automotive employees, benefiting their children who have recently graduated from high school or university with a financial award. The program reflects our corporate meritocracy, allowing each child the opportunity to succeed based on a defined and transparent list of criteria that is streamlined across all regions. In 2022, 1,500 applications were reviewed and a total amount of \u20ac715,000 has been distributed to the awarded children.\n\n- The global employee volunteerism program at Stellantis started as a former FCA program in 2014 designed to empower employees to make a difference in their communities by connecting to projects, programs, and partners that benefit from their talent. With a designated number of hours of paid time off, employees choose purposeful projects that they feel passionate about, while communities where the Company operates benefit from the employees\u2019 time and expertise. The volunteerism program fosters a sense of service and gratitude, supporting the Company\u2019s purpose and values.\n\nWe are part of the communities we work in and our employees are also influenced by them. Some examples of projects created also with our social partners and put in place in our communities:\n\n- India: Construction of a school block for a government school and will benefit more than 300 rural students studying in the school from surrounding villages in the vicinity of the Stellantis plant in Thiruvallur.\n\n- France: Hosting of young people from sensitive sectors on company discovery courses in their third and last year at Clotilde Vautier College in Rennes. Hiring and training of refugee with AGIRC14 in Caen.\n\n- Spain: Support for women victims of gender-based violence and at risk of social and professional exclusion by providing coaching to improve their skills to face job interviews, find employment opportunities and by giving them social and economic support in partnership with non-profit entities (like the \u201cRed Cross\u201d)\n\n- Brazil: Estelar program which offers grants, transportation, food, life insurance and support for sports or gym. Young people have tutoring at Stellantis, in addition to technical and qualification courses carried out by the National Service for Industrial Training.\n\n- U.S.: Design and paint a mural on the exterior wall of Stellantis NV\u2019s new Jeep plant, part of the automaker\u2019s $35 million community benefits agreement with the city and residents.\n### 3.1.8 Detailed Key Performance

and developing all talent\n\nTalent management takes center stage in Stellantis Human Resources activity and practice. We strive to attract and retain diverse talents all over the world with the capabilities required for our success. At Stellantis we aspire to be recognized as the \u201cemployer of choice\u201d in the labor marketplace. Our intentions are to create actions that retain and attract talent with critical skills. Our objective is to build an Employer Brand action plan by implementing a process to monitor the attractiveness of our Company. To further engage and motivate our team, meritocracy is at the center of our strategy, as we recognize and reward success. As announced in Dare forward 2030, our objective is to have approximately 4,500 software employees by the end of 2024, achieved through a combination of hiring, upskilling and reskilling our existing talent. Our capacity to develop internal strategic skills in software, data and electrification, is key. This is the reason we have launched dedicated learning academies.\n\nOur aspiration is to build an agile learning organization by shifting the learning paradigm from a push to a pull learning model. This approach will provide more support to existing talent who want to develop their skills and find appropriate resources to perform in their current role, therefore satisfying their growth ambitions.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nEmployees are the asset that will lead the transformational change that it is underway in the auto industry. In order to remain one of the leading companies in the sector, at Stellantis we strive to provide opportunities for our people to grow professionally, helping in the retention of skills and the development of talented and engaged teams.\n\n3.2.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\nCommitment scoreboard\n\n| CSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE | VISION/AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | RESULTS |\n|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|---------|\n| Attracting and developing all talent | Recruit and empower talents, by increasing a \u2018learning enterprise culture\u2019 and developing strategic skills, with the right talents in the key roles to create a highly committed workforce and seize new businesses. | Access rate to training (+No. of employees trained/total number of employees) | Short-term: 2024: 95% | 2022: 85%* |\n| | | % of technical engineering reskill/upskilling | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan): 2030: 100% | 2021: 72% |\n| | | | Long-term: 2040: 100% | |\n| | | | | ~6% |\n\n* 2022 data calculated in FTE, not comparable with 2021 data\n3.2.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nIn 2022, 33,267 new employees were hired (versus 34,571 in 2021) in strategic fields including Purchasing, Supply Chain, Software, Marketing and Sales therefore demonstrating our goal of being an employer of choice. With today\u2019s transformation of the automotive industry, attracting and retaining talent at Stellantis is of high importance. In relation to talent management activities, we identified the following risks and opportunities:\n\n- **Risks linked with the tight labor market that is persistent in markets around the world**: in these markets, specific skills and the most talented people have more options for employment\n  - Through global teams and projects, development programs, specific international assignments and the possibility to work remotely, many employees at Stellantis can and do have an impact beyond their geographical location\n\n- **Risks related to weak employer brand recognition**\n  - We are strengthening communication about our employer brand initiatives and existing brand career pages will be directed to the new Global Stellantis career page\n\n- **Risk of not having the right skills in the right places at the right time**\n  - Through the Job Family approach, strategic skills management and the learning academies, regular reviews and actions are taken to ensure the skills of the future are being cultivated\n\n- **Risk of not matching skills needs and learning offers**\n  - Strategic skills are linked to new tech and market challenges. Software, digital, ADAS and electrification are emergent topics with limited availability of internal and external content. This risk is mitigated by leveraging our subject matter experts (technical fellows), scouting international digital libraries and application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to match skills and learning resources\n\n**Opportunities**\n\n- A unique opportunity for talent to work with Stellantis, a great company to work for according to the framework agreement, become exposed to, or work within a wide variety of cultures, because of a workforce composed of 162 nationalities (versus 170 in 2021).\n\n- The merger gave us the opportunity to optimize our processes, combining best practices from former companies. This year we deployed our new Talent Management processes, centered around the Employee Talent Journey and Managerial Practices.\n\n- Through the redefinition of the Internal Mobility Rules, we are increasing job opportunity awareness for our employees, enabling them to more readily take on new challenges with our organization. This will also enable us to better enhance diversity and inclusion across our teams, which will accelerate change and drive performance.\n\n- Opportunity to build a great environment for employee self-development within a new learning platform, to develop and anticipate the future strategic skills needed to grow our business.\n3.2.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nThe entire Top Executive Team (TET) plays a vital role in building, reviewing and approving the top layers of the organization. The TET members work diligently with each other and their strategic Human Resources Business Partners on building, refining and improving the structure of their teams. Changes to the structure of their teams and talent placements are reviewed with the full TET, including the Chief Executive Officer, for discussion and approval in committee meetings that occur two times per month. For the layer under their direct reports, TET members discuss, review and share their proposals with the Chief Human Resources Officer for input and approval. These reviews occur semimonthly or monthly, based on the volume of changes, in a Strategy Council meeting or a dedicated HR committee meeting.\n\nThese activities, with direct executive involvement, since 2021 led to the confirmation or creation of over 411 leadership teams, the appointment of over 3,586 leaders in Stellantis (with 27% of positions held by women, versus 24% in 2021, within the top three layers of the Company). Succession planning activities are managed to ensure that appropriate talent is available to fill critical or strategic managerial roles.\n\nThe Stellantis Talent identification process aims to search for diverse profiles and experiences, identify and look for talent within the organization, assign diverse talent to key positions, support new businesses, protect knowledge and knowhow, promote and develop local skills and objectively reward performance. The identified next career steps, for employees, are discussed by leaders in the organization and used to create formal succession plans. These plans are a point of focus for the analysis of the Stellantis talent pipeline as well as the identification and execution of development actions. Succession plans for critical and strategic roles are based on meritocracy, performance, technical and leadership assessments and take into consideration the aspirations of employees. Succession plans are reviewed specifically with TET members and are monitored by a team of HR professionals dedicated to the support of talent activities. These plans also form the foundation of developmental activities for this population of high potential employees with specific actions identified to increase readiness and prepare talent for future roles.\n\nStellantis Learning Organization called Stellantis Learning Hub operates at a global level in order to set the learning strategy, as well as design and deliver common strategic initiatives. The Stellantis Learning Hub also enables the extension of the global strategy into our regions, where global and local programs are delivered. Technical Academies offer learning opportunities through the development of designing and delivering technical skills and related training initiatives within their divisions.\n\n3.2.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nTalent Management\n\nBased on meritocracy and contributing directly to the corporate strategy, the Stellantis talent management approach seeks to diversify profiles and experiences and to identify and look for talent within the organization. The focus on strategic skills allows the organization to identify the best match between future needs and current resources. A network\nof experts contributing to the Company\u2019s technological roadmap is in place, whose mission is to identify the skills required according to the technical needs within the Company. This approach can be defined as \u201cTalent to value\u201d: we identify the roles that drive the performance and put our most talented people in the right roles.\n\nAt the heart of the global HR policy to manage skills, we set up a worldwide and cross organization governance of 15 Stellantis global job families. Our objective is to build the roadmap of technical strategic skills for current employability and future transformation. We kicked off the foundation of a global network of expertise with the Chief Technology Officer leadership gathering Senior Fellows and Fellows to drive technical innovation. This community will play a key role for research and experimentation, external relationships, and partnership to develop technical know-how aligned with the Dare Forward 2030 strategy.\n\nStellantis Learning Transformation Policy\n\nStellantis\u2019 ambition is to create a widespread culture of continuous learning that leverages in-house experts and enhances learning in the flow of work and continuous development. This ambition is made possible by a strategy focused on two main axes:\n\n1. progressively combine the \u201cpush\u201d actions, recommended by the Company, with other \u201cpulls\u201d, which leave full autonomy to people.\n2. segment initiatives, learning methods and measures according to their purposes:\n   - **Common ground**, giving common identity while enhancing diversity. This includes initiatives related to common values, leadership behaviors, the rules that each of us must respect for safety and well-being.\n   - **Employability**, providing or reinforcing the technical skills necessary to work efficiently in the short and medium term. The role of the Academies is fundamental for the design of the training offer in collaboration with professional families.\n   - **Create the Future** support the strategies by providing the knowledge that will be necessary to support them in the future. Prepare, for example, for entrepreneurship and new ways of working.\n\nCompensation Policy\n\nStellantis\u2019 compensation policy is designed to promote and reward those who achieve results based on leadership and performance. The Company benchmarks its compensation and benefits programs. We aim to offer consistent and fair compensation and benefits that are aligned with its overall business strategy. Stellantis commits to communicate to employees in every country, the various aspects of compensation, social benefits, health and disability insurance, personal development and working environment. As evidence of the ability of the employee representatives to reconcile cost control, competitiveness and rewarding performance, 174 salary agreements were signed (versus 62 in 2021).\n\nThe **Company\u2019s compensation policy has three main objectives**:\n\n1. reward performance;\n2. provide an equitable, fair, competitive, market-driven compensation package;\n3. attract and retain key talent.\nOur compensation policies and practices are designed to comply with applicable laws with a focus on diversity and inclusion. Compensation practices involving recruitment, promotions, annual salary reviews and incentive awards are reviewed for consistency across employee groups. Allegations of issues regarding eligibility or compensation actions are reviewed for further analysis, explanation and any eventual actions or resolution.\n\nA base salary is determined on the scope of job responsibilities, experience, performance and the competitive market. Collective variable compensation is a component of the comprehensive compensation programs offered by Stellantis. These collective programs target all categories of employees and aim to reward collective and individual performance while engaging employees in value creation for the Company. As a base benefit Stellantis employees across the globe receive basic health care coverage through company insurance programs or from their local government health system where applicable.\n\nCompensation & Benefits Practices \u2013 Living Wages\n\nWe align with the United Nation\u2019s Declaration of Human Rights principle that everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family. Workers deserve a living wage and fair pay brings benefits for families, communities and our business. Fair compensation means ensuring the pay for employees is set at a level that is both fair and livable and provides equal pay for equal work. A \u2018Framework\u2019 for fair compensation covers the overall compensation process. It provides a structured way for a company to outline how the various elements of their compensation packages deliver fair compensation to their employees.\n\nOur Framework applies globally and has several principles reflective of our commitment:\n\n- fair and livable compensation;\n- market-based compensation;\n- no discrimination in compensation;\n- pay for performance;\n- good faith negotiation of compensation with recognized employee labor organizations.\n\nLong Term Incentive by gender\n\n| Year | Women | Men | Total |\n|------|-------|-----|-------|\n| 2022 | 342   | 1,447 | 1,789 |\n| 2021 | 366   | 1,554 | 1,920 |\n\nThe Company\u2019s compensation policy has three main objectives:\n\n1. reward performance;\n2. provide an equitable, fair, competitive, market-driven compensation package;\n3. attract and retain key talent.\n3.2.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nGlobal Leadership Development team\n\nThe Global Leadership Development team is dedicated to the design, planning, education and governance of talent management and leadership development activities. The tools include, but are not limited to, assessment centers, coaching, mentoring and digital assessment tools. The team works closely with a global network of over 50 leadership development professionals specifically identified to coordinate and support talent activities within each regional organization and each global function. This global network works together to lead the execution of all talent activities with the operations facing HR teams around the world.\n\nStellantis Learning Hub\n\nTo support Stellantis\u2019 transformation to a sustainable mobility tech company, it is vital that employees learn continuously throughout their careers. The Stellantis Learning Hub is a new Stellantis organization dedicated to learning through a network of academies, learning communities and teams; an agile organization that leverages smart systems to:\n\n- make knowledge available anytime, anywhere, right when it is needed;\n- connect diverse and distributed expertise and intelligence.\n\nCentral Hub sets the learning strategy and the learning ecosystem at a global level. It also designs global programs across divisions, supporting talent development, business priorities and corporate transformation.\n\nTechnical Academies collect technical needs and design Professional Families related training. The academies are Engineering, Electrification, Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing, Retail, Corporate, Data & Software, Purchasing and Supply Chain and ICT & Digital. They provide training programs related to current and future employability.\n\nLearning teams at the region and country level support the implementation of global strategies and initiatives. They also manage local challenges, rules and specific needs.\n\nThe Company invested approximately \u20ac197 million in training during 2022, delivering about 3.17 million hours of training to approximately 208,535 employees.\n\n| Year | Hours of training | Individual training courses provided to employees | Training investment per FTE (in \u20ac) | Average hours trained per FTE | Employees benefited from at least one training course during the year |\n|------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2022 | 3,175,783        | 662,540                                       | 809                             | 13                          | 208,535                                                       |\n| 2021 | 3,497,750        | 458,913                                       | 505                             | 12,5                        | 202,437                                                       |\n\nThe Company invested approximately \u20ac197 million in training during 2022, delivering about 3.17 million hours of training to approximately 208,535 employees.\nCompensation and Benefits\n\nThe overall Company\u2019s compensation policy also includes providing an employee competitive benefits program in each of the countries, while controlling costs and meeting Stellantis\u2019 social responsibility commitments. As the Company continues in the integration of the merger, an analysis of benefit programs globally is being conducted to harmonize and benchmark competitive market practices in each country.\n\nThe Company\u2019s determination to reward based on merit was demonstrated through the expansion of the bonus plans. In 2022, approximately 61,000 Stellantis employees (versus 60,541 in 2021) received bonuses based on Company and individual performance in 2021. Additionally, the Company expanded the profit sharing upon 218,630 employees, with a total distribution of \u20ac1.8 billion. Stellantis offers Long-Term Incentive (LTI) for specific top managers and key talent and 1,789 employees benefited. It is a significant component as it is designed to attract, retain and motivate expert leaders and talent. Performance goals set for LTI compensation are aligned with the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders, goals include total shareholder return, synergies and CO\u2082 emissions reductions.\n\n3.2.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nFrom day one, we built the Stellantis family with our talents at its core and the ambition to:\n\n- develop the right talents and skills for sustainable transformation;\n- create the conditions for greater retention, attractiveness and performance.\n\nThis is the reason why in 2022, Stellantis took an important step forward in the evolution of our talent strategy by launching a new program called BOOST: Building On Our Singular Talents. The BOOST program is intended to create a level of clarity and transparency to all employees on expectations and empower them to continue to grow and develop in their careers. The backbone of this program is the Employee Talent Journey.\n\nEmployee Talent Journey:\n\nThe Stellantis Employee Talent Journey is how we work together to drive the performance of the organization through development and growth.\n\nThe Employee Talent Journey is based on six main steps during the year.\nAt the beginning of each year, managers and employees, white collar workers, identify objectives and related targets for the year. In the second step, managers and employees discuss employee\u2019s aspirations and the local leadership behaviors in line with the Stellantis Leadership model.\n\nTechnical skills is another step dedicated to the key competencies of employees and their current and future employability within the Company. Technical skills libraries are identified by job families, referring to specific areas of employability called professions. The skill set includes a mix of skills needed to support both current employability and more strategic to enable our future. Employees can customize their profiles adding new skills to complete their skills profile before starting the self-assessment on a five-point rating scale. For employees this is the opportunity to think about their current competencies and the new ones that they can develop to reach their aspirations.\n\nCareer planning is also considered in a dedicated phase; this is the opportunity for employees to identify concrete career steps for the future. Based on the employee\u2019s performance, aspirations, leadership behaviors, technical skills and experience, managers and employees discuss next potential positions for the employee and discuss what it will take to get there.\n\nDevelopment actions are then identified and managers and employees work together to identify the highest developmental priorities, defining concrete actions and resources to act on those priorities.\n\nThroughout the year employees work to reach the targets with managers supporting and providing feedback where needed. To aid in the growth and development of our employees, we have developed a 360 assessment tool. Centered around the Stellantis Leadership Values, this online tool enables employees to get anonymous feedback from their managers, peers and direct reports/downstream customers, allowing them to get a holistic view of how they perform and deliver in their role. Based on the feedback they receive, they can then use that information to inform their development plan and future growth.\nOnboarding\n\nAt Stellantis we welcome our new talents and make newcomers ready to be part of the company. All new talents start with an Onboarding training, sharing our values and visions as well as to help them become committed members of Stellantis, a company in full transformation aimed at meeting the new mobility needs of our customers.\n\nInternal Mobility\n\nInternal mobility is a way to enhance career progression while helping Stellantis meet strategic business needs with existing employee skill sets. In our transition to a mobility tech company, it is essential to utilize all the expertise that employees bring to the table. Building on our singular talent while finding fresh ways to contribute to the Company\u2019s vision and success. \u201cBe Mobile\u201d is a program setting new internal mobility rules, providing visibility on internal opportunities; making our mobility journey more understandable and accessible.\n\nEmployer Branding\n\nIn 2022 we reviewed our Talent Acquisition policy and tools to ensure that our processes are bias-free and to attract diverse candidates from all over the world. We are also working on the Stellantis Employee Value Proposition to define our unique employee proposition which will differentiate us from competitors and allow us to be selected as an employer of choice by external and internal candidates with skills critical for our success.\n\nNew Era of Agility\n\nIn 2022 the New Era of Agility project is active in 23 countries, allowing employees in engineering and central support functions to work remotely up to 70% of their work time. It allows greater usage of time and resources as well as accelerating digital transformation for better agility and efficiency.\n\nIt is also a factor of attractiveness and new flexibility in talent acquisition. The complement of remote and on-site work with collective and collaborative spaces encourage interaction, cross-fertilization and the development of a sense of belonging within the Company. As mentioned before, the new challenge of Hybrid work has been supported with a learning environment designed around the learner to give employees the opportunity to leverage resources needed at the right time.\nLearning activities\n\nLearning activities carried out in 2022 to support the Stellantis learning policy were:\n\n- new learning organization;\n- new digital libraries for white collar workers and the leadership team with more than 20,000 learning contents (online courses and videos);\n- one single Learning Experience Platform was launched, including the provision of a rich offer of digital content;\n- targeting all white collars employees;\n- Artificial Intelligence (AI) engine activated into this platform aimed at matching individual skill development needs with the right content.\n\nThe journey to being a tech mobility company requires new ways of learning that put each person at the center and consider different needs and goals. In 2022 several initiatives were provided.\n\nCommon Ground\n\nCompliance courses generated 200,000 training actions in 2022:\n\n- Code of Conduct and Data Privacy training campaigns (launched in 2021) were finalized mid-February 2022;\n- the new training on Anti-phishing, Fraud, Raising Concerns and Privacy, with an average completion rate above 90% and an average Net Promoter Score (customer satisfaction index) above 60;\n- 67 sessions were organized for Managers on Ethical leadership as well as 6 sessions in legal topics (competition law and Board Members).\n\nValues and Purpose programs: driven by top managers who played the role of \u201cleaders as teachers\u201d involving more than 2,300 employees in highly engaging master classes:\n\n- Diversity and Inclusion learning path: a strong curriculum of online courses and virtual classes aimed at building shared roots on Diversity and inclusion on a global basis. Around 70,900 employees successfully completed the program with an average Net Promoter Score of 57;\n- a new Stellantis onboarding e-learning was designed and deployed to white collars new comers, with a global completion of above 6,000 employees trained;\n- to accompany the new Wellbeing, Health and Safety strategy of the Company, two e-learnings were created (one on the policy, one to raise awareness), more than 9,000 employees trained;\n- also two programs of 15 hours about Mindfulness (for France and Italy) were organized: 150 employees trained.\nReskilling / Upskilling\n\nCreate the Future\n\n- **New Era of Agility learning path**: this is the basis of the new way of working in Stellantis. Since the launch at the end of 2021, 21,742 employees completed the managerial training which provides the opportunity to share methods and guidelines with team members. A Net Promoter Score of 60 was reached.\n\n- **Customer Centricity**: several initiatives to increase the awareness of Customer stakes: five conferences and masterclasses, four e-learnings were launched, involving about 12,500 employees with an average Net Promoter Score of 74.\n\n- **Green Mindset**: a Climate School was launched with a rich and dynamic set of resources, courses and initiatives related to the climate impact and green attitude. Around 13,000 employees participated in 2022.\n\nEmployability\n\n- **Digital Transformation path** aimed at building the digital culture in Stellantis. Within three years we expect to reach all white collar workers. As of December 2022, 37,584 employees received the digital literacy self-evaluation and 26,963 reached the foundational level.\n\n- **Electrification and Data & Software Academies initiatives**\n\nTop Competencies\n\nThe safeguarding of internal careers is for example accomplished in France with the internal retraining program known as Top Competencies, through training paths that last over 18-24 months. This program supports employees who are changing professions or Job Family in cases of transformation or when linked to technological developments. In 2022, 754 employees took part in retraining paths, with \u20ac747,000 spent. Around 55% of these employees joined professions with new and rare skills.\n\nStellantis prepares the transformation of the Company into a tech company with the creation of two academies:\n\n**Software Academy**\n\nA software division was created as a standalone division in 2021 with the mission to develop new platforms and businesses that will propel future success. In order to staff the new Software Division, a recruitment effort is deployed in five main hubs, U.S., India, Italy, France and Germany, to provide software critical skills from the global tech labor market. The hiring process started July 2021 and allowed the onboarding of 300 newcomers at most levels in 2021 and recruit up to 761 new employees in 2022 in this area. Furthermore, a Data and Software Academy was launched in 2022 to upskill and reskill over 1,000 Stellantis employees per year in software professions and reconvert internal existing talents into skills critical for the Company in the future. The **Data and Software Academy** ambition is to feed Software teams with Stellantis employees who would have been identified and upskilled or reskilled because of the academy;\nto deploy the data driven strategy across all divisions to make sure every team is making the most of data; to improve our employees\u2019 employability by offering them new careers, certifications and new opportunities within the Company.\n\nThe Data and Software Academy is also working on an innovative format to have content available 24 hours a day, seven days a week by developing a virtual 3D online academy that is slated to launch in 2023. The idea of the virtual 3D academy is to propose a place that is accessible, at any time, using innovative technologies with a metaverse approach integrating a virtual reality experience to complement the experience and provide the feeling of being together with the teacher and colleagues. The learning offers could be accessible based on this platform including virtual classes, forums to exchange with peers, talks, online content or workshops. We want this online academy to be the flagship of the Academy and to embody the tech positioning Stellantis is taking. It is also an opportunity to test a use of a metaverse world to be able to be more comfortable with this technology and extend it to other fields later.\n\nElectrification Academy\nA dedicated Electrification Academy has been created to support Stellantis strategic shift to new electrified business, as part of Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan. The Academy delivers global e-learning programs around electrification and e-Mobility. The purpose is to spread up-to-date awareness among employees and engage them with the stakes of the energy transition, the technologies, Stellantis\u2019 strategy and the full customer ecosystem.\n\nIn 2022, as part of the global upskilling on electrification, more than 56,700 employees were trained on the global e-Mobility and electrification fundamentals, through e-learning modules. In addition, 14,500 employees have been trained on electrification-related topics within several professions, with 94,000 hours delivered. Moreover, advanced upskill and reskill programs are in place to adapt competencies to electrification across job families, such as engineering, manufacturing and sales and marketing, by ensuring best in class level of skills and boosting internal employability.\n\nAMAZON AND STELLANTIS COLLABORATION FOR CUSTOMER-CENTRIC CONNECTED EXPERIENCES\nStellantis is accelerating its shift to becoming a sustainable mobility tech company. Stellantis and Amazon are collaborating to deploy Amazon\u2019s technology and software expertise across Stellantis\u2019 organization, including vehicle development, building connected in-vehicle experiences and training the next generation of automotive software engineers. In 2022, 926 employees were trained on Amazon cloud related technologies.\n\nA dedicated Electrification Academy has been created to support Stellantis strategic shift to new electrified business, as part of Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan.\n\nPRESS RELEASE\nTitle Amazon and Stellantis Collaborate to Introduce Customer-Centric Connected Experiences Across Millions of Vehicles, Helping Accelerate Stellantis\u2019 Software Transformation\nhttps://www.stellantis.com/en/news/press-releases/2022/january/amazon-stellantis-collaborate-on-software-solutions\nSKILLS DEVELOPMENT ON E-POWERTRAIN\n\nIn the field of Engineering, customized training paths combining e-learning, internal classes and also partnerships with universities are in place to feed the needs around e-Powertrain, and to facilitate the conversion from Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) engineering curriculum.\n\nIn 2022, 511 employees joined the e-Powertrain division, 75% through internal upskill and reskill programs, and 25% from external hiring.\n\nEngaging the universities\n\nStellantis partners with several international universities to get the best knowledge and keep in touch with new talent. Among them:\n\n- Polytechnic of Turin (Italy), University of Windsor (Canada) and McMaster University (Canada) with the direct support of Stellantis to the International Degree in Automotive Engineering but also direct collaboration in research and innovation projects.\n- University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Italy) with the direct provision of mechanical vehicle design courses.\n- University of Trento (Italy), for the study and development of Cooperative driving assistance (ADAS) and autonomous driving (AD) enabled by Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) connectivity.\n- McMaster University (Canada), Ohio State University (U.S.) and Oakland University (U.S.) in the field of hybrid and electric vehicle technologies.\n- Several universities in France in collaboration aimed at providing Stellantis with PhDs working for the company for three years.\n- Polytechnics of Milan and Turin, University La Sapienza in Rome and Federico II in Naples (Italy) in collaboration aimed at providing Stellantis with PhDs working for the company for three years.\n\nThe Stellantis Star*Up Studio\n\nStar*Up, launched globally in 2021, is a program aimed at encouraging and transforming our employee\u2019s ideas and promoting an intrapreneurship spirit within Stellantis. Employees were invited to submit their ideas and each region selected the top ideas to enter a three-month incubation phase. Each idea is accompanied by an internal coach and the Incubees have access to a Platform with an introduction to innovation methods such as Design Thinking and Lean Startup, essential to achieve success of the project. At the end of the incubation, winners of the regional finals enter a 9-to-12 month experimentation towards first customers and first revenues in the Business Factory.\nIdentifying Livable Wage Amounts\n\nOur principles to provide Fair and Livable Wages requires us to be aware of what is a credible Living Wage amount for each country in which we have employees. In some countries, however, there are different Living Wage amounts quoted by different organizations and often based on different criteria. To assist in determining an appropriate amount to use, the Company has contracted the Fair Wage Network, an independent, recognized authority on fair and living wages, to provide a global solution. They have developed a global database composed of Living Wage amounts for over 200 countries and cities. The Living Wage amounts are based on cost of living data, local market surveys, government wage minimums, along with other organizations\u2019 wage benchmarks. The Fair Wage Network will update their database on at least an annual basis to reflect any changes to Living Wage levels for each country based on inflation and improved data sources.\n\nInternal compliance monitoring of the Stellantis Fair Compensation Framework\n\nThe HR lead in each country will be responsible to monitor the compensation of its employees to comply with the Company\u2019s Global Compensation\u2019s framework of a Livable Wage, annually. Any adjustments necessary to comply will be addressed during annual salary reviews or where applicable through negotiations with employee representatives / Trade Unions.\n\n3.2.8 Detailed Key Performance Indicators\n\n3.2.8.1 Annual Appraisal by geographic area, gender and category*\n\n| Year | Women | Men | Total |\n|------|-------|-----|-------|\n|      | Blue collars | White collars | Management | Top Management | Total | Blue collars | White collars | Management | Top Management | Total |\n|      | Blue collars | White collars | Management | Top Management | Total | Blue collars | White collars | Management | Top Management | Total |\n| Enlarged Europe | 2022 | 4,976 | 11,179 | 148 | 16,303 | 28,021 | 37,763 | 476 | 66,260 | 82,563 |\n| 2021 | 8,919 | 11,647 | na | 20,566 | 49,986 | 40,340 | na | 90,326 | 110,692 |\n| North America | 2022 | 164 | 3,689 | 72 | 3,925 | 8,921 | 14,303 | 231 | 23,455 | 27,380 |\n| 2021 | 772 | 4,471 | na | 5,243 | 3,391 | 18,367 | na | 21,758 | 27,001 |\n| South America | 2022 | 949 | 1,820 | 5 | 2,774 | 6,499 | 5,198 | 34 | 11,731 | 14,505 |\n| 2021 | 168 | 2,485 | na | 2,653 | 970 | 5,953 | na | 6,923 | 9,576 |\n| Middle East & Africa | 2022 | \u2014 | 638 | 1 | 639 | \u2014 | 1,203 | 10 | 1,213 | 1,852 |\n| 2021 | 24 | 677 | na | 701 | 259 | 1,257 | na | 1,516 | 2,217 |\n| China and India & Asia Pacific | 2022 | \u2014 | 917 | 3 | 920 | 114 | 2,448 | 15 | 2,577 | 3,497 |\n| 2021 | 33 | 875 | na | 908 | 364 | 2,832 | na | 3,196 | 4,104 |\n| Total | 2022 | 6,089 | 18,243 | 247 | 24,561 | 43,555 | 60,915 | 803 | 105,273 | 129,797 |\n| 2021 | 9,916 | 20,155 | na | 30,071 | 54,970 | 68,749 | na | 123,719 | 153,790 |\n\n* In 2022 92% of white collars workers completed the annual appraisal process (see chapter 3.2.7 for further information on BOOST program). The overall reduction in our population taking part in this process was due to a redistribution of blue collar talent across markets were annual performance appraisals are not part of blue collar

opportunity\n\n3.3.1 CONTEXT AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\nCSR issue/challenge #6: Diversity and equal opportunity\n\nPowered by our diversity, we lead the way the world moves. Diversity is a strength for Stellantis and we encourage a diverse and inclusive environment, celebrating the differences that our employees bring to work every day. Three guiding principles define our approach to Diversity and Inclusion (D&I):\n\n1. **Empower diversity through meritocracy**: meritocracy is key in Stellantis to drive company performance.\n2. **Respect for local traditions and context**: understanding and respecting our employees and their backgrounds is key to driving a diverse and inclusive environment.\n3. **Find global common ground considering regional specificities**: we respect the specificities of each local context when deploying global strategy. On a global perspective, the Stellantis D&I strategy focuses on the dimensions related to gender, citizenship and generation.\n\nIn 2022 we worked to align our Human Resources processes with the Diversity and Inclusion vision, strategy and leadership commitment. This exercise included policies applicable to key elements of the employee journey, such as Talent Acquisition, Succession Planning, Talent Development and Remuneration. However, we worked to embed diversity and inclusion in all relevant HR processes. Examples of actions are:\n\n- publication of the new inclusive statement in all Stellantis job descriptions and global adverts;\n- talent identification guidance created to support meritocracy, avoid bias and encourage diversity of talent in the pipeline;\n- D&I standpoint in the HR systems configuration promoting wider data availability to monitor diverse KPIs;\n- inclusion of D&I in the 2023 framework agreement as a commitment to build a diverse and inclusive workspace;\n- increased transparency in the availability of internal mobility opportunities.\n\nFrom a learning perspective, in 2022, a Diversity and Inclusion training path was developed and launched to share the Stellantis D&I vision and commitment with employees across the globe, to explain unconscious bias and raise awareness on microaggressions. At the end of 2022, our first Global Survey was put in place, to understand employee perceptions and feedback on engagement, wellbeing, motivation and inclusion.\n\nIn 2022 efforts were made to anticipate the 2025 goal related to the percentage of women in leadership positions (L1-L2-L3), reaching the result of 27%.\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nPowered by our diversity we lead the way the world moves, this is our purpose. Diversity and inclusion are therefore intrinsic parts of our Company\u2019s commitment on equality of opportunity. We work to offer our employees an inclusive work environment, where everyone can feel respected and valued. Stellantis publicly calls for the prevention of discrimination and the promotion of equal opportunities. Our Company\u2019s commitments have been detailed in Company agreements, such as the Diversity and Inclusion Leadership Commitment, which was signed in 2022. Our commitment is underlined through our signing of the UN Global Compact as Stellantis on May 31, 2021.\n\n3.3.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\nCommitment scoreboard\n\n| CSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE | VISION/AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | RESULTS |\n|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|---------|\n| Diversity and equal opportunity | Reinforce diversity, equal opportunities and inclusion as a strength for our teams and business by influencing the development of new ideas and solutions that will shape the future | Workforce gender balance: % women in leadership position (L1-L2-L3) | Short-term | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan) | Long-term | 2022 | 2021 |\n|                      |                 |                | 2025: >30% | 2030: >35% | 2040: >40% | 27% | 24% |\n\n3.3.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nWe identified the risks, in case our actions do not align with our commitments and identified the opportunities for our Company to sustain a diverse and inclusive environment.\n\n- **Inability to attract and retain diverse talent** impacting our ability to innovate and adapt to our global customer needs and expectations.\n  - By communicating our D&I strategy and commitments, we place D&I at the heart of our Employer Brand, the Company reputation as an employer and present Stellantis as an employer of choice to future talent.\nPotential of noncompliance with local regulations and cost of managing individual employee claims on the grounds of discrimination or harassment.\n\n- Our Code of Conduct states our commitment to compliance with all applicable local laws, with some commitments going beyond legislative requirements. In addition, we provide comprehensive employee training on D&I, for example, Unconscious Bias, Preventing Discrimination and Harassment.\n\nDifficulties when trying to build a global multicultural organization\n\n- Through a comprehensive Intercultural Learning and Awareness Program, we ensure that employees are equipped with the knowledge and skills to work with colleagues in a multicultural working environment.\n\nDifficulties when trying to integrate new generations\n\n- Through Mentoring and Reverse Mentoring programs knowledge, experience and insights are shared between generations within the workplace.\n\nOpportunities\n\n- As a business, we are more agile with the ability to develop and adapt to social and industry transformations\n- the ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers through diverse and representative teams\n- increased employee motivation and engagement by maintaining a fair and inclusive workplace\n- optimizing efficiency, leading to greater performance and business sustainability, by leveraging all talent and diversity;\n- from an external stakeholder perspective, we can maintain and even improve, the Company\u2019s image and reputation due to our progress and achievements with the help of our commitments and action plans\n- by developing a strong employer brand, which is closely aligned with our Diversity and Inclusion strategy, we have the ability to attract and retain top talent.\n3.3.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nDIVERSITY AND INCLUSION ORGANIZATION\n\nThe **Global Diversity Council** is chaired by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and composed of the Stellantis Top Executive Team, some of whom also have the responsibility as Chairs of the Regional Diversity Councils for their region. The Council has the responsibility for setting the Company\u2019s **Diversity and Inclusion strategy** in alignment with the overall business strategy and objectives. It provides governance and oversight on the delivery of the key Diversity and Inclusion actions and the effectiveness of the Diversity and Inclusion function.\n\nThe **Diversity and Inclusion office** is responsible for defining and implementing the Company\u2019s Diversity and Inclusion strategy on a global level and coordinating the extension of the global strategy into our regions and countries of operation.\nWithin our regions, the Chief Operating Officer chairs the Regional Diversity Council. Each Regional Council is responsible for establishing the Regional Diversity and Inclusion strategy and associated action plans, whilst supporting the implementation of local Diversity and Inclusion action plans, ensuring that regional and local actions align with the global strategy.\n\nMoreover, collective bargaining agreements, established in collaboration with our Social Partners, state our commitments on diversity and inclusion, with a focus on the elimination of discrimination and the promotion of diversity.\n\n### 3.3.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nWe seek to promote a diverse and inclusive environment where we respect the different characteristics of our employees, including but not restricted to, gender, age, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual orientation and disability. Stellantis D&I strategy reinforces our commitment to providing equality and fairness to all in our employment, based on merit and our zero-tolerance approach to all forms of unlawful and unfair discrimination (as also committed equal treatment and non-discrimination in our Human Rights Policy).\n\nThe strategy shares our diversity and inclusion aspirations in relation to our customers, our employees, our future talent, our leadership and the communities where we are located, while setting up the key areas of our approach:\n\n- **commitment**: building a diverse and inclusive workspace that aims for stronger employee engagement, leading to greater business sustainability\n- **learning and awareness**: ensuring all employees have equal access to training and development opportunities, and a specific learning and awareness program to raise awareness on key diversity and inclusion topics\n- **employee Voice**: the importance of employee voice and creating channels for them to be heard\n- **employer brand**: ensuring we reach a diverse audience with our employment opportunities and ensure that our selection processes are free of bias.\n\n**Code of Conduct**\n\nThe Stellantis Code of Conduct (CoC) sets out the principles and requirements that employees are expected to respect in relation to diversity and inclusion, when interacting with colleagues, customers, suppliers, visitors and other business partners (62,814 employees trained).\n\nThe Code of Conduct expresses the Company\u2019s commitment to maintaining a fair and inclusive workplace, free from favoritism, violence, sexual and non sexual harassment, or any kind of discrimination including based on age, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or religion. The Company promotes equal employment opportunity and diversity, where everyone is valued for their contributions to the Company.\nCollective Bargaining Agreements\n\nStellantis voluntarily formalized its actions in favor of diversity in its social dialogue. On an international scale, the Collective Bargaining Agreements on Social Responsibility are committed to exceeding local legal requirements in applying and promoting the fight against racism, sexism, xenophobia and homophobia and, more generally, against intolerance of differences and safeguarding respect for privacy. In 2022 a global agreement was prepared and will be signed with IndustriALL Global Union (a global union organization) in 2023. In this agreement the Company officialized its global commitment on different areas, including diversity and inclusion, and it will be implemented at a regional level with concrete actions.\n\nAGREEMENT WITH TRADE UNIONS ON GENDER EQUALITY\n\nIn 2022, France\u2019s trade unions have unanimously signed a new agreement relating to the development of employment for women and professional equality between women and men. In France, this approach reinforces the substantive actions already initiated in previous agreements and aims to enrich the dynamic with new initiatives developed in the field to make our Company and our sector of activity more attractive to women.\n\n3.3.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nStellantis recognizes the value of engaging with and involving employees in our diversity and inclusion journey and has supported the establishment of a wide range of resource groups across the organization. These resource groups undertake multicultural learning opportunities, mentoring and networking events, community outreach initiatives, charitable activities and contribute to the development and improvement of HR policies and processes across the Company. We believe that employees actively participating in Resource Groups, contribute to developing a diverse and inclusive working environment.\n\nIn 2022 two new resource groups were created at a global level within Stellantis:\n\n- Women of Stellantis: the group focuses on the promotion of gender equality within the workplace.\n- DIVERSE\u2022abilities Network Support, represent and advocate for the global disability community through knowledge sharing, capacity building, fostering resilience whilst eliminating stigma and barriers surrounding disability. Establishing and ensuring accessibility in all forms.\n\nFor more information refer to 3.1.7\n\nGRI 3-3\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\nWomen of Stellantis Launches as First Stellantis Global Business Resource Group in Observance of International Women\u2019s Day\n\nhttps://www.stellantis.com/en/news/press-releases/2022/march/women-of-stellantis-launches-as-first-stellantis-global-business-resource-group-in-observance-of-international-women-s-day\nA global intranet site dedicated to D&I was published for Stellantis employees containing news, initiatives and useful materials related to diversity and inclusion topics. On this site, employees can also find links to the main resources published in the Company about D&I training and programs. A glossary was also published on the site and shared with all regions, in order to provide employees a common guide on D&I terminology within Stellantis.\n\n**BUSINESS RESOURCES GROUP**\n\nIn Stellantis, Business Resource Groups (BRG) are also active in the U.S.: Asians Connected Together (ACT), the DIVERSE-abilities Network (DaN), The Indigenous Cultural Opportunity Network (ICON), Latins in Connection (LinC), Middle Eastern Employees Together (MEET), the Prism LGBTQ+ Alliance, the Stellantis African Ancestry Network Diaspora (STAAND), the Stellantis Veterans Group (SVG), the Women of Stellantis (WoS), Women in Manufacturing (WiM), and the Working Parents Network (WPN).\n\nIn the UK, RUOK? (Are You OK?) is an employee-led group, created to support the mental health and wellbeing of employees through raising awareness, providing information and resources, and removing the stigma associated with mental health by providing the space and time, and encouraging conversation around mental wellbeing. In 2022 a dedicated section to RUOK was created in The Hub (Stellantis intranet), which provides information on who individuals can turn to for help and support.\n\n### 3.3.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nAs set forth in our Code of Conduct, Stellantis is committed to gender equality, and is aligned with the vision of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on Gender Equality. Also, Stellantis intends to sign up to the UN Women\u2019s Empowerment Principles, which encourages companies to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women in the workplace, industry and community.\n\nWith this commitment, the Company shares its intention to adopt business practices that support gender equality and empower women within the Stellantis organization, globally and across the automotive industry. These include, among others, processes to ensure equity and fairness in the determination of compensation levels (blue collars average wages for women is 0.94% of average wages for men and 0.91% for white collars), annual salary reviews and promotions; provision of flexible working opportunities to support work-life balance arrangements; and events to foster interest in technical careers among women.\nIn 2022, Stellantis earned 100% on the annual Disability Equality Index (DEI), a comprehensive benchmarking tool that helps companies build focused and measurable strategies that support disability inclusion and equality in the workplace. The Company was also recognized by DiversityInc as a Noteworthy Company for Diversity and Inclusion efforts.\n\nIn 2022 Stellantis was also listed in the top 100 Refinitiv Global Diversity & Inclusion Index.\n\nGlobal Development Initiatives & Awareness\n\nIn 2022, several Stellantis organizations promoted mentoring programs at global and regional level. All proposed programs follow a purposefully structured internal engagement strategy that connects individuals into ongoing professional learning and development relationships. The main purpose of mentoring programs is to be an enabler and a development accelerator for:\n\n- **diversity & inclusion**: pairing and connecting mentors and mentees across gender, generation, nationalities, countries and cross-functions, creating a more inclusive work environment that promotes exposure and interaction opportunities for people with diverse backgrounds\n- **career development**: creating awareness on main challenges, goals and experiences to undertake in order to unleash full individuals\u2019 potential and enable career progression\n- **core values dissemination and leadership behaviors** development.\n\nPrograms were developed for leaders, including masterclasses which provided high impact, interactive sessions, that introduced our leaders to a variety of topics to further develop their awareness on inclusive leadership and build the interpersonal skills needed to thrive in a global, hybrid workplace. Eight masterclasses were launched globally and three focused on Diversity and Inclusion (1,521 managers attended):\n\n1. The Inclusive Leader.\n2. Creating Psychological safety.\n3. Why inclusion is the skill above all else.\n\nInitiatives to increase the awareness on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) topics are also active in the Company. Employees can establish deeper connections through an extended opportunity to engage with one another. These programs provide an opportunity to have small group discussions about our differences (and ultimately our similarities) in a safe confidential setting, the opportunity to openly discuss DEI concepts with colleagues and a call-to-action to extend our \u201ccircles\u201d to include those different than ourselves.\nDuring the Diversity Awareness Month in October, various speakers offered a collection of robust testimonies and sparking fresh ways to embrace inclusivity. During the month, diverse topics were highlighted to raise awareness on gender, disability, allyship, citizenship and generations. An Inclusion task force was set up for the Diversity Awareness Month. The task force undertook the work of developing, championing and implementing diversity month initiative. Developing solutions which draw on the perspectives of staff at all levels of the Company. Acting as ambassadors for good inclusion practice in members\u2019 respective departments.\n\n**D&I AWARENESS**\n\nStellantis developed a strong project related to D&I awareness within Manufacturing Plants in South America. Approximately 200 employees participated in 20 listening groups sessions conducted by National Service for Industrial Learning (SENAI). Diverse topics were addressed, such as gender, ethnicity, generation, citizenship, disability and LGBTQ+. Based on these insights, training, mentoring and awareness initiatives have been launched and will continue through 2023. In total, about 1,620 employees (white collar and blue collar workers) will be involved in these actions.\n\n**Citizenship**\n\nDiverse programs have been launched during 2022 for leaders to support them in managing international teams. With 162 nationalities (versus 170 nationalities in 2021) and the possibility to work remotely, some managers face the challenge of managing diverse teams. Stellantis employees can access the internal information hub dedicated to Intercultural Awareness and the \u2018Country Navigator\u2019 tool, which provides employees with the knowledge, skills and confidence to effectively communicate and collaborate with global colleagues, enabling a truly borderless workplace. Dedicated programs support the development of cultural intelligence.\n\nLeading Global Teams, a leadership program focusing on the development of global leaders was created to inspire global leaders and enhance their inclusive leadership skills. This program that was launched at the end of 2022 with 60 global leaders and will continue in 2023. The program is composed of six main steps, each one with specific objectives: understanding Stellantis D&I culture, developing inclusive leadership behaviors and dealing with diverse teams, leverage leading mindset changes using diversity as a positive force, recognizing the value of cognitive diversity, learning inclusive communication behaviors and be effective advocates for diversity in the Company.\nGender\n\nStellantis adopts a proactive commitment to promoting gender diversity and professional equality. In view of its traditionally male sector of activity, the Company considers the gender balance of its core businesses and key positions as a fundamental objective of its responsible and sustainable development and of its employees\u2019 quality of life at work. 20.79 percent of Stellantis employees are women in 2022 (versus 20.51 percent in 2021). In 2022, women represented 27% (versus 24% in 2021) of leadership positions (L1-L2-L3)* and 30.2% of hiring with all employee categories combined.\n\nInitiatives are managed by the \u201cWomen of Stellantis\u201d resource group that focuses on promoting gender equality and inclusion within the workplace. They are active in 25 countries, and thus contribute significantly to the Company\u2019s cultural transformation.\n\nIn line with the Company strategy to become a sustainable mobility tech company, in 2022 we started to monitor the percentage of women in our core STEM functions: Software, ICT, Engineering, Manufacturing Engineering. There are 15.9% women in these functions.\n\nIn 2022, several Stellantis organizations promoted mentoring programs at global and regional levels. For example the \u201cWomen in Leadership\u201d global development program involved the Software, ICT, Manufacturing and Engineering functions. The program focuses on: Impact and Influence, Career Management and Strategic Acumen. In 2022 50 employees were involved.\n\nStellantis is committed to supporting women\u2019s empowerment through different initiatives:\n\nAdditionally, Stellantis saw the launch of the Supporting the Progression of Women workshop. The workshop addresses ways in which managers may support both their direct reports and the progression of women more generally. The Global Business Resources Group, Women Of Stellantis has driven initiatives in all regions of Stellantis.\n\nWOMEN OF STELLANTIS\n\nThe \u201cWomen of Stellantis\u201d is the first global business resource group within Stellantis with a member base of over 5,000 employees worldwide (men and women), a 77% increase in member growth year-over-year. The group acts as a think tank contributing to business issues and cultural change while encouraging members to be advocates of tomorrow\u2019s Company, through key management or expertise positions. In 2022, the Women of Stellantis global team organized global efforts around International Women\u2019s Day and International Day of the Girl, as well as hosting a virtual leadership series highlighting female executives around the world. Women of Stellantis groups in each business region also hosted over 100 events to support local initiatives and professional and personal growth opportunities.\n\n* Hierarchical position below CEO excluding assistants\nRace & Ethnicity\n\nStellantis has developed several programs and policies specifically supporting ethnically underrepresented populations and 43% of diverse ethnicities were hired in total workforce in the US in 2022. In 2022, the Black Leaders Advancement Collective (BLAC) leadership development program was launched, involving 15 employees with the objective to prepare emerging diverse talent for leadership opportunities.\n\nLaunched in 2021, the Black Supplier Development Program continued also this year, in collaboration with the National Business League (NBL), to develop Black suppliers for future contracting and procurement opportunities in the pursuit of greater racial equity in the marketplace. The Stellantis-NBL National Black Supplier Development Program will support the development of Black businesses around the country and internationally for future opportunities within the federal government and public and private sectors.\n\nIn line with UN Declaration on the Rights of indigenous Peoples and international legal framework, Stellantis makes all due efforts to respect, include and promote local communities in its work. In 2022, Stellantis was recognized as a Top 50 Workplace for Indigenous STEM Professionals in North America by Winds of Change magazine and was also recognized as one of the Top 50 Best Employers for Latinas in the United States (#10) by LATINA Style magazine (the Company is the highest rated automaker in 2022). Furthermore, Stellantis has been ranked a five-star company on the 2022 Hispanic Association on Corporate Responsibility (HACR) Corporate Inclusion Index. The annual survey measures Hispanic inclusion in corporate America and assesses companies to help identify opportunities for growth in their Hispanic diversity and inclusion practices.\n\nGenerations working together\n\nStellantis seeks to strengthen the place of more experienced employees and considers them an advantage for the Company\u2019s success. Through mentoring programs, the Company encourages knowledge transfer, builds leaders who model inclusion through trust, transparency and feedback. This exchange and the coexistence of generations is considered as an asset for social cohesion and business performance.\n\nTo attract the next generation of talent into the automotive industry the Company has programs in place.\n\nOn a regional basis, countries such as India, Brazil and China have specific projects focused on attracting candidates directly from university campuses in order to meet our future skills requirements in areas such as software and digital technologies. In India, the Company works on the National Employability Enhancement Scheme (NEEM) program in collaboration with the Government. NEEM is aimed at recruiting and providing the under-skilled youth the much-needed exposure and training to acquire the finer skills.\n\nStellantis received the label \u201cHappy Trainees\u201d in the category \u201cinternational\u201d initiated by \u201cChoose my company\u201d, that rewards companies that have particularly distinguished themselves in welcoming its trainees, apprentices and Volunteer International Experience (VIE) within its institutions.\nDisability\n\nStellantis policy regarding social and occupational inclusion of people with disabilities is enacted worldwide through various collective agreements with the goal of keeping workers with disabilities employed, carrying out preventive actions and promoting their integration into the workplace. Taking such an approach benefits everyone as well as the Company\u2019s performance and includes:\n\n- offering **employment opportunities** for individuals with disabilities\n- supporting the inclusion of employees with a disability by **raising awareness** among employees throughout the year and by reinforcing the training of managers and trainers\n- taking action to include and retain employees with disabilities and maintain them in their jobs by supporting them and providing **adjusted work solutions or specially adapted workstations**\n- mobilizing all actors by **improving awareness of collective agreements** and of measures in favor of the workers concerned (local disability correspondent, social service, medical service, human resources function, management, employee representatives and employees) and by setting up preventive measures.\n\nThe **DIVERSE\u2022abilities Network** is one of the company\u2019s global Resource Groups that aims to support employees with disabilities, employees who are caregivers of family members with disabilities, and employees responsible for the care of elder loved ones by providing resources, training and development programs.\n\n**REGIONAL INITIATIVES**\n\nIn 2022, in France, we engaged a new collaboration with the sheltered sector to develop our partnership and created a video to raise awareness in their teams and ours. During the European Week for the Employment of Disabled People in November, Stellantis highlighted its partnerships with Adapted Companies (EA) and Establishments and Services for Help through Work (ESAT).\n\nIn the U.S. Autism Management is available for eligible employees and their dependents. It provides support for families who have children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) including assistance with Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) management, integrated services coordination (e.g., physical therapy, occupational therapy and behavioral health) as well as intensive case management for outlier cases.\nLGBTQ+\n\nOur LGBTQ+ BRGs are committed to sustain LGBTI+ employees through learning, mentoring and talent development initiatives. In 2022, Stellantis signed the \u201cLGBTI+ Business and Rights Forum\u201d, a mobilization of companies in Brazil committed to making true the maxim of the United Nation\u2019s Universal Declaration of Human Rights for LGBTI+ that states that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.\n\nStellantis is demonstrating the Company\u2019s commitment to LGBTQ+ employees, customers and communities with a variety of events and programs throughout Pride Month. Detroit (U.S.) is home to one of the largest celebrations as the colors of the rainbow are full display in June at Motor City Pride, the annual two-day festival and parade that is the largest LGBTQ+ gathering in Michigan. Stellantis and the Jeep brand are the presenting sponsors of the festival and parade. In Canada, Stellantis facilities across the country are showing their support by raising the Pride flag throughout June, like many U.S. and Mexico Manufacturing facilities.\n\nThe Prism LGBTQ+ Alliance resource group, established 2003, welcomes employees and allies to participate in Pride Month in June, National Coming Out Day in October, and is a key partner to Stellantis brands. Prism promotes inclusion for everyone and recorded multiple \u201cLet\u2019s Get Real\u201d panel discussions about various topics including how to support LGBTQ+ children, transgender issues, the proper use of pronouns and the importance of Allies. The group counts more than 200 members and two Executives sponsors.\n\nParenthood\n\nStellantis takes parenthood into account as part of its respect for gender equality in the workplace. By supporting a work environment encouraging employees to return to work after maternity / paternity leave, Stellantis helps employees who are parents to achieve a better work-life balance for example by providing childcare / education subsidy for children or by signing work-life balance agreements (to reduce the working day hours or change the work schedule through different alternatives to ease family care). It also ensures employees are informed about the possible parental leave options, depending on the legislation, encouraging both mothers and fathers to take advantage of it. In some countries, the Company offers improved maternity leave conditions compared to the national ones by offering better economic conditions (for example in the U.S., UK and UAE) or by giving the possibility to extend the period of leave (e.g., in Argentina and Mexico).\n\nIn many sites of the Company, lactation rooms are available to support mothers that are back at work and want to continue breastfeeding. At the country level, for example in Spain, flexible breastfeeding leave options are also available (by hour or accumulation in full days).\nDifferent benefits to support parents and their families are active at a country level (e.g., reimbursement of kindergarten or babysitting; Scholarship and family care programs, health insurance for family members). Flexible working time is also possible thanks to New Era of Agility (NEA) project that allows eligible employees to work remotely up to 70% of their work time.\n\nDomestic Partner Benefits are available to both same-sex and opposite-sex partners at country level. We recognize family trends are changing and domestic partner benefits meet the needs of a diverse and dynamic workforce as well as the expectations of prospective employees.\n\n**DONATIONS OF HOLIDAYS**\n\nOn top of the public regulation, Stellantis has a proactive approach with its social partners, for example in order to support working parents. A company agreement was signed in 2014 in France with all trade unions to establish an innovative social cohesion system based on the values of solidarity and mutual assistance.\n\nUnder this agreement, employees can donate days off to parents with a sick child, anonymously and without receiving anything in return. The donated days are banked in a Solidarity Fund created for this purpose and is managed by the workplace social services. In 2016 a new agreement extended the program to spouses, common-law spouses and partners. Starting in 2020, another agreement extends this program to employees who are caregivers of a dependent or disabled relative. This program has received a strong response.\n\nIn 2022, 192 days have been donated. 384 days were granted to 27 employees to help them cope with a variety of situations including illness, disability or accidents.\n\nThe result of the Equity Index in France for the companies \u201cPSA Automobile S.A\u201d confirms that the policies implemented, particularly in the area of wages, have had a positive impact and encourages us to continue our efforts to promote professional equality between women and men.\n\n| Year | Equity Index |\n|------|--------------|\n| 2022 | 94           |\n| 2021 |

issue/challenge #7: Wellbeing, health and safety in the workplace\n\nEmployee workplace wellbeing, health and safety is an increasing societal demand and a top priority for Stellantis. We attend to employee safety, health and wellbeing by applying a methodical approach that involves stakeholders, employees, employee representatives, the medical community and management.\n\nAfter establishing the Stellantis Wellbeing, Health, and Safety policy in 2021, this year saw the implementation of programs designed to bring the policy to life. Stellantis has put its people at the center of everything we do, using safety, health and ergonomics as a foundation on which to build wellbeing. Successful implementation of these programs will provide a competitive advantage in terms of absenteeism, reduced compensation costs, employee retention and motivation and therefore company performance. This is a strong driver of our Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan related to its \u201cCare\u201d pillar and our ambition to be a great company to work for.\n\nWe innovate by challenging the status quo, such as remote working (New Era of Agility) encouraged where applicable to reduce CO\u2082 emissions associated with employee commutes and to expand wellbeing in the workplace, improve efficiency and quality of life by encouraging work-life balance.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nThe Company allocates resources (e.g., standards, safe equipment and workstations, people, employee assistance programs) for an approach that goes beyond health at work and contributes to healthy choices and lifestyle. It supports the \u201cHealthy Workplaces\u201d initiative promoted by the European Union and the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as similar initiatives in the U.S.\n\nStellantis\u2019 commitment is demonstrated in the Wellbeing, Health and Safety policy, as well as in several collective bargaining agreements.\n3.4.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\nCommitment scoreboard\n\n| CSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE | VISION/AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | RESULTS |\n|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|---------|\n| Health, safety and wellbeing in the workplace | Create a safe and engaging work environment promoting employees\u2019 health and wellbeing at work for a greater work life balance | Lost-time injury frequency rate [LTIR /1,000,000 hwkd] | Short-term | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan) | Long-term | 2022 | 2021 |\n| | | | 2024: <1 | 2030: <1 | 2040: <1 | 1.25 | 1 |\n\n3.4.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nFor a company, Health and Safety performance at work has a direct impact on employee absenteeism and thus on the ability to operate and on labor costs through lower productivity by loss of working time, cost of occupational illnesses, etc. It can also affect the Company\u2019s reputation, impact staff morale or increase operating costs through fines and other contingent liabilities. It is seen as an ethical responsibility, that is good for our people and good for our business.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis highlighted the commitment, robustness, and ability of the Health and Safety community to provide the relevant recommendations, based on the best knowledge available to leaders and managers to address an unprecedented threat. An effective approach, including masking, vaccine promotion and workplace social distance allowed Stellantis facilities to live with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic with fewer business disruptions.\n\nRisks\n\n- Physical Safety risks\n  Manufacturing facilities, if not properly managed, can potentially expose employees to risks that could lead to injury or illness. Effective Risk Management and Reduction procedures are in place to identify and correct activities in the workplace that can lead to injury and illness.\n\n- Mental Health risks\n  Mental health risks encompass a wide array of conditions that lead to business risk and employee concerns. Risk Analysis has widened and now includes the protection of the risks to which an employee could be exposed as a result of his/her mission, including expanding protection from psychosocial risks beyond European Operations. Addressing these risks results in a decrease in absenteeism, workplace violence and potential self-harm, but also in an increase of wellbeing and motivation of the employees.\nRegulatory risks\n\nAs a global company, Stellantis operates in jurisdictions that regulate health and safety. These regulatory requirements vary across the regions in which Stellantis operates. It is important to know these requirements to avoid noncompliance and the potential for fines or other enforcement actions.\n\nThe Company\u2019s actions and innovations to mitigate these risks\n\nStellantis is committed to prevent health and safety risks at work of employees. Preventing fatality, disability, injury and illness by completing risk analysis to identify workplace hazards and potential exposures and implementing containment and countermeasures to permanently reduce the identified risks. Stellantis promotes wellbeing, health and safety to support and enhance a healthy and engaged workforce. An effective management system provides efficient and simple standards for critical hazards and follows up with a global audit process to ensure implementation. This management system puts employees at the center of the solution, not treating them as the problem we need to control, so that each contributes to improving the workplace.\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe Stellantis Wellbeing, Health and Safety policy is based on the conviction that our actions have a significant impact on many critical domains. It is a fundamental aspect of our social responsibility towards our employees and all the people working in our facilities as well as the mark of the Company\u2019s respect for each of the individuals who are part of it:\n\n- bringing to life the Wellbeing, Health and Safety policy can improve the social climate and embodies our corporate values and its impact on our people\u2019s sense of belonging;\n- Caring for our people is essential to our Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan as a strong driver to become a great company to work for. Being able to understand employee experiences and to identify our strengths and areas of improvement allows us to contribute to the Company growth and performance. That is the reason why the first global employee survey was launched in September 2022. The results of this survey provided us with the critical data, at the global, local and team level, to drive improvement and strengthen our Company.\n- This first survey will be followed by a dedicated global survey on psychosocial risks in 2023, to provide managers, HR and health and safety specialists with accurate and relevant data worldwide.\n- Taking care of our people and acting to reduce injuries has direct and positive consequences on absenteeism, which is important for all our operations;\n- In keeping with safety industry thought leaders, Stellantis has shifted focus to concentrate on the prevention of life altering injuries in its facilities. The identification of the true root cause of these life changing injuries, known as Serious Injuries and Fatalities (SIF), and incidents that could have resulted in a life changing injury but did not, known as potential Serious Injuries and Fatalities (pSIF), is required in each Stellantis location. All manufacturing locations have been trained on how to identify a pSIF incident so that measures could be put in place to prevent future similar incidents.\n\nAn effective management system provides efficient and simple standards for critical hazards and follows up with a global audit process to ensure implementation.\n\nFor more information refer to 3.1.7\nacting to promote wellbeing and motivation through global and local actions is also a strong lever to improve productivity, quality, innovation and the capability of our workforce to adapt positively to current and future challenges we will have to face and changes we will have to create.\n\n3.4.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nThe governance process is overseen by the Strategy Council. In monthly business reviews the results related to wellbeing, health and safety are presented and discussed with the analysis of the impact on operations. Those indicators include safety results and responses to employee surveys.\n\nWELLBEING, HEALTH AND SAFETY GOVERNANCE\n\n- WHS Executive Council\n- Validation of the WHS Policy\n- Human Resources and Transformation\n- Audit and Compliance\n- Corporate WHS Audit\n- Wellbeing, Health, and Safety (WHS)\n- Corporate WHS\n  - Standards\n  - Systems\n  - Internal WHS Audit\n- Regional WHS\n  - Operations\n  - Program implementation\n  - Site WHS Management\n  - Joint Management / Worker H&S Committees\nThe Corporate Wellbeing Health and Safety (WHS) organization ensures proper coordination of WHS activities, processes and targets throughout the regional Stellantis organizations. In each region, a Wellbeing, Health and Safety leader is appointed and is in charge of contributing to the global policy, implementing programs, engaging the operations in the region and providing the regional top management with results and analysis. Because the Health and Safety domain is part of the Stellantis Production Way management system, key indicators of the manufacturing operations include Health and Safety related indicators, among which are Total Recordable Injury Rate, Lost Time Injury Rate, Serious Injuries, and absenteeism. To be launched in 2023, a proactive approach to Health and Safety is tracked via the \u201cCare Index\u201d, measuring the level of maturity of Health and Safety System Implementation in our sites. The Care Index includes key measurables from Safety, Health, Wellbeing, Ergonomics and Systems maturity.\n\nJOINT HEALTH AND SAFETY COMMITTEE\n\nIn North America, U.S. and Canada, weekly meetings are held to review changes in employee safety activities, procedural updates and other opportunities for improvement are undertaken by the Joint Health and Safety Committee comprised of representative of Management and Labor Union.\n\nThe dialogue concerning improvement of employee health and safety with employee representative bodies, in accordance with current laws and the collective bargaining agreements, has continued. In most host countries, joint management-worker organizations are in charge of monitoring the application of employee health and safety practices. 92% of Company employees are represented by 266 joint management-worker health and safety committees.\n\n3.4.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nWe Care for the Future is one of four core values of Stellantis. Care extends not only to the environment, but also to our people. Managers are accountable for the wellbeing and motivation of their teams. In fact, this is one of the leadership behaviors by which Stellantis managers are evaluated and is a direct demonstration of the Company\u2019s commitment to the betterment of our employee\u2019s lives. Caring for our people is part of our Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan to build a great company to work for.\n\nOur commitments related to wellbeing, health and safety are also grounded in several Company policies:\n\n- The Code of Conduct with commitments about protecting our workforce that refers to ensuring health and safety and promoting wellbeing and a healthy lifestyle.\n- The Wellbeing, Health and Safety policy is defined as part of the Human Resources ambitions for Stellantis. This formal document was signed by Carlos Tavares and all Executive Vice Presidents and communicated to all employees in October 2021.\n\nActing in a proactive and structured mode and building our Wellbeing, Health and Safety program will be a competitive advantage for the Company. We aspire to achieve world class levels of health and safety for everyone, everywhere, every time.\nWe act to:\n\n- prevent fatality, disability, injury and illness;\n- promote health and safety to support and enhance a healthy and engaged workforce;\n- empower everyone so that each contributes to improvement of the workplace;\n- deploy an efficient management system to provide strong standards, measure our results and impacts and support our continuous improvement.\n\nIn order to live up to our Wellbeing, Health and Safety policy, Stellantis created a wellbeing and motivation program, labeled \u201cWe All Care\u201d, based on five pillars that highlight the priority levers on which to act.\n\nHealth and safety agreements\n\nStellantis is committed to implement the best occupational health and safety standards and practices and has made health and safety a top priority. This commitment is demonstrated in the Wellbeing, Health and Safety Policy, as well as in several national Company agreements with employee representatives. Each year, health and safety agreements are signed in the countries where the Company operates. There were 22 health and safety agreements signed in 2022.\n\n3.4.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nStellantis wants global health and safety standards no matter where in the world we operate.\n\nThe Stellantis Production Way (SPW), Health and Safety domain is dedicated to improving health and safety in a systematic manner by involving the entire manufacturing organization and encompassing all phases of production. It includes a combination of preventive measures and collaboration of employees.\n\n- Employees are involved through training that focuses on the importance of safeguarding health and safety; complying with policies and procedures; and promoting appropriate prevention behaviors across all organizational levels and roles.\n- Operators are also engaged in initiatives designed to increase safety awareness and participate in a comprehensive system for gathering feedback and suggestions. Through the Work-Related Alert and Safety Conversation tools, useful and implementable ideas are put into practice, shared across multiple facilities, with the project owners recognized for their involvement.\n\nThe SPW Health and Safety domain applies risk management and reduction, both on a routine and non-routine basis, with the purpose of singling out major risk areas and implementing preventive action plans. Risk areas include physical, ergonomic, chemical and psychosocial risks. The Hierarchy of Controls methodology is then used to determine the proper countermeasures. Supervisors and managers are expected to continually work to reduce risk level of their top risks and to assess the daily mood of their employees.\nBased on the SPW Health and Safety domain, the Global Care Management System (GCMS) is an integrated management system that recognizes not all processes designed for manufacturing work in a non-manufacturing setting, while also comprehending that much of the Health and Safety domain requirements are in fact, universal. The GCMS concerns every person that works on Stellantis sites, including employees of service provider companies.\n\nThe way this is accomplished is by testing the applicability of each requirement to determine if it does apply, does not apply or must be adapted to fit the non-manufacturing setting. This ensures that wellbeing, health and safety are considered, planned and implemented everyday at Stellantis operations.\n\nWith the Global Care Management System, Stellantis is compliant with the occupational health and safety recommendations of the International Labour Organization (ILO OSH 2001) and performs its obligations in all countries. Encompassing ISO 45001 requirements, the GCMS is a means to assess, monitor and manage risks systematically.\n\nThere are 42 European sites that have an Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems certified according to ISO 45001:2018 standard.\n\nAs an additional control, an internal auditing program has been established. The audit scope includes activities that are most likely to produce SIF and pSIF incidents, safety, health, ergonomics and wellbeing. The 24 audits of Stellantis sites were completed by WHS Corporate in 2022. Regions and Audit and Compliance conducted additional audits.\nWorker representatives are involved in Stellantis health and safety processes. Areas where worker representatives participate in health and safety processes include, but are not limited to, incident reviews, job risk analysis, safety observation tours and periodic health and safety reviews. Where there are formal joint management worker health and safety committees, there are no bargaining unit workers that are not represented by these committees.\n\n**Safety resources**\n\nPhysical safety can impact many parts of the business. Employees that are concerned for their safety will not be able to concentrate on the job at hand. The need for safety in our operations is driven not only by how the lack thereof can impact business results, but more importantly by a moral imperative to return people home in the same condition as they arrived.\n\nEach manufacturing unit in Stellantis is staffed with qualified safety professionals to ensure not only that our facilities are in regulatory compliance but also to develop capability in our teams to identify and manage safety risk. Non-manufacturing locations, such as the retail Stellantis & You organization also have dedicated safety resources to manage the unique safety risks associated with non-manufacturing activities. In total, there are 314 employees dedicated to assuring safety in Stellantis facilities.\n\n**Medical resources**\n\nFulfilling requirements of local regulations, that differ from country to country, a team of 600 physicians and 604 nurses focus on prevention, occupational follow up, emergency care and health promotion. Local workers at all Stellantis sites have access to medical resources. Stellantis believes that health must be taken as a holistic matter and achieving occupational health goals requires improvement of the comprehensive health of the employee.\n\nPrevention covers the activities dedicated to occupational risks and exposure assessment related to any health consequence from work activities. Occupational follow up includes monitoring, examinations to check for exposure consequence, assess fitness to work and any potential limitations. It includes individual follow up by physicians, trained nurses, physiotherapists, and/or psychologists to consider early symptoms, either physical or psychological, before requiring long or complex treatment and fosters sustainable employability.\n\nStellantis Health teams are dedicated to the care of employees while respecting their right to confidentiality and professional secrecy. The health-related information collected through internal occupational Health services is kept under the responsibility of the physician in charge, supported by the country Health coordination. Many countries implement an IT solution to store them, implement and monitor the Occupational Health processes. Each IT solution is compliant with the country regulation.\n\nEmergency care is organized in every facility with internal resources or external support to address critical medical situations.\nErgonomics: strong asset\n\nThe team of 89 Stellantis ergonomists works with the objective of promoting ergonomics to improve employees working conditions and overall efficiency within the Company. This team is divided into three teams:\n\n- the Trade Ergonomists team is responsible for standards development and ensuring the deployment of the Company\u2019s guidelines and tools;\n- the Project Ergonomists team works with manufacturing engineering to ensure that ergonomic standards are met when purchasing and installing new equipment and new programs;\n- the Site Ergonomists team analyzes and improves ergonomics at their respective facilities.\n\nThe objective of each team is to design a user interface adapted to physical capabilities, to prevent the deterioration of working conditions and its consequences both on individuals e.g., health, particularly musculoskeletal diseases and on the related costs for Stellantis such as loss of full-time equivalents, cost of occupational diseases, etc.\n\n3.4.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nTraining and prevention programs\n\nThere are mandatory training and certification requirements targeted to operations and facilities. We provide health and safety protocols and recommendations regardless of where the workplace is located, on-site, home or remote working locations.\n\nBased on accident analysis and risk assessment, specific training programs are developed and deployed at all sites. In 2022, 350,717 hours of training were dedicated to safety (versus 363,410 in 2021).\n\nA global e-learning overview on WHS was launched during the We All Care Days and completed by 10,000 employees. The learning includes our ambitions and the principles of our We All Care Policy. In addition to ensuring HR leaders understand the importance of WHS activities, a WHS leadership masterclass was attended by the top 240 HR managers in the Company.\n\nHEALTH AND SAFETY PROFESSIONALS IN CANADA\n\nIn Canada every managed site or division has one or more health and safety professionals, depending on the employee population of the site, employed by Stellantis. These employees are responsible for executing the Company\u2019s occupational health and safety management system. Manufacturing locations are certified to ISO 45001 and utilize the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle of continual improvement to reduce injury rates and meet obligations. Non-manufacturing locations utilize the same PDCA principles to achieve continual improvement.\nCommunication of Expectations\n\nTo support the policy of reporting hazards, the corporation communicates via the Stellantis Production Way - \"Can Do\" booklet and other global communication forums the three essential behaviors for safety:\n\n- Stop if you are not trained for a task or if your safety is at risk.\n- Speak Up and intervene if you have a concern for anyone's safety.\n- Listen if someone shows concern for your safety and resolve the concern together.\n\nAt a local level, sites have completed risk assessments for workstations and tasks that promote application of the hierarchy of controls. They review those risk assessments after incidents and injuries occur. All accidents are analyzed using the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle methodology, through the accident analysis tool. At a regional and global level, standards are developed that sites must assess their conformance to and progress plans to close nonconformance. These standards define actions in line with the hierarchy of controls and are support by good practices. The main types of work-related injuries were, 1. laceration, primarily finger and hand injuries, 2. contusion 3. strains and strains from slip/trip and fall.\n\nRegarding safety, our vision is to provide world class levels safety which means the following ambitions:\n\n- Zero fatalities over three years.\n- 50% reduction in Total Recordable Injury Rate by 2030.\n- The Lost Time Injury Rate always below 1.\n\nWe have a comprehensive roadmap to reach those targets with specific actions such as Serious Injury and Fatality elimination plan or specific Care Index to develop a more proactive approach. All our fundamentals and standards related to health and safety are part of the Stellantis Production Way management system which ensures a strong and consistent implementation in our manufacturing operations.\n\nHEALTH\n\nErgonomics\n\nThe Ergonomics team takes a comprehensive and collaborative approach to identify the Top 10 critical workstations such as impact on safety, quality, etc., and provide different solutions based on the best practices implemented within the Stellantis scope. The focus is on manufacturing Business Units, including General assembly, Painting, Welding, Chassis, Powertrain, and Press shop. The team then uses indicators to monitor compliance with ergonomics criteria in the different milestones of vehicle and powertrain projects.\n\nWorkplace social services for employees\n\nThe main role of social workers is to facilitate job integration by assisting employees dealing with issues in their personal and professional life that are having an impact on their occupation. Social services are a place to discuss issues and be listened to. They also provide specialist advice to managers and help implement the corporate social policy.\nStellantis provides a hotline for employees with possible face-to-face follow up Employee Assistance Programs (EAP). Each region has its own programs that are tailored to the specific needs of the region. China and South America launched their EAP in 2022. Workplace social services are provided to all employees through a network of 91 internal and external social workers at office and manufacturing facilities. In North America, Stellantis offers off-site Family, Health and Wellness Centers to provide medical care for our employees and their families as well as on-site Health Coaches.\n\n**Mental and Musculoskeletal Health**\n\nIn addition to the management system in place, a health action plan, focusing on mental health and musculoskeletal health, has been built to be sustainably implemented through the whole organization. This Health action plan gathers the best practices to prevent illnesses from occurring. After this first phase, the implementation is ongoing throughout the different regions, to reach a homogeneous result.\n\nOn mental health, actions to be extended are: training and masterclasses, EAP programs, available specialized support, dedicated surveys, and mental health first aiders. In one third of the Company, we have the experience of monitoring various mental health indicators including the number of calls to EAP programs for psychological reasons, absenteeism related to mental health issues, stress, wellbeing and motivation. Implementation of this monitoring for nearly all employees is planned for 2023. This supports our efforts to support employee health, as well as the positive outcomes for teams and the organization. It enables health services to follow trends, provide feedback to management and results can be considered in order to act.\n\n**MENTAL HEALTH**\n\nLeveMente Program in Brazil: Multidisciplinary monitoring with psychologists and psychiatrists, including care plans and priority in scheduling appointments for employees and their families, who need Mental Health support.\n\nIn the UK the Mental Health First Aiders are employees trained to have an open mind to recognize mental health problems. A Mental Health/Substance Use Disorder (MH/SUD) program is available in the U.S. for eligible employees, retirees and their dependents. It provides confidential counseling, education and referral services to assist members with stress, depression, anxiety, conflict management, managing emotions and substance use treatment and recovery. Covered services include outpatient visits, inpatient admissions, partial hospitalization programs, psychological testing, care management and utilization review.\n\nFor musculoskeletal health, good practices and tools are specified within the SPW. In addition to preventive and corrective ergonomics, early care and treatment are promoted and implemented everywhere internal resources are available. Those plans are empowered by focused health promotion actions to pursue mid- and long-term positive consequences on the health and lives of all employees.\nSAFETY\n\nManagement of Business Partners\n\nMajority holding joint ventures are included in our safety performance tracking and adopt common policies and processes. Visitors receive information on arrival to a site regarding the health and safety rules they must follow; close working relationships, with safety performance tracking, are established with temporary employment agencies in order to ensure temporary employees receive appropriate training before arriving on site. This is supplemented with on-site training. Contractual obligations for minimum safety standards are established with contractor companies that can only work on site after risk assessments and method statements have been completed to ensure their interaction with our operations will not create additional hazards. Audits on contractor activities are routine practice.\n\nPrevention of SIF and pSIF incidents\n\nA program of serious injury and fatality elimination is strategically overseen at a global level and promoted by the development of common global standards for high-risk activities and the implementation of global \u201cCall-to-Actions\u201d, charging all sites with the implementation of common action plans to eliminate and control such high-risk hazards.\n\nHazards are systematically identified through workplace and task risk assessments and subsequently controlled. Workers are trained to identify and report to their line supervisor, any situation that they consider could create harm. If a response is not forthcoming for the line supervisor, workers may raise their concerns with a Health & Safety professional or their employee representatives.\n\nTotal Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR)\n\nIn 2020 Stellantis set targets for Total Recordable Injuries, those are injuries that need treatment beyond First Aid. By 2030 we want to reduce the rate of recordable injuries by 50%. Each entity has its own targets to achieve which are closely followed. In 2022 the rate decreased by 2%.\n\n| Year       | Total Recordable Injury Rate |\n|------------|-----------------------------|\n| Enlarged Europe | 2022 | 2.79 |\n| North America   | 2022 | 5.63 |\n| South America   | 2022 | 4.75 |\n| Middle East & Africa | 2022 | 3.97 |\n| China and India & Asia Pacific | 2022 | 0 |\n| **Total**      | **2022** | **3.79** |\nRISK ASSESSMENT\n\nOne of the first principles of prevention is to assess the risks involved in order to identify the most effective preventive measures. The methodology used for the assessment, management, and reporting of occupational risks is developed for example in Portugal through several Permanent Security Instructions (IPS).\n\nThe risk assessment is in accordance with the requirements set out in the legislation and regulations in force at the time of the evaluation and is always carried out by trained technicians with the necessary professional accreditation, and whenever required, with the participation of the hierarchy, the concerned personnel and other technical services of the company.\n\nOnce existing risks have been identified, their level of risk is assessed and measures are taken to reduce the risk. We have multiple layered risk assessment processes based on the life-cycle of the activity and/or equipment.\n\nRisk assessments must be completed for:\n\n- routine and non-routine activities;\n- activities of all persons having access to the workplace (including contractors, interns and visitors etc.);\n- human capabilities and other human factors;\n- identified hazards originating outside the workplace capable of adversely affecting the health and safety of persons under the control of the organization within the workplace;\n- hazards created in the vicinity of the workplace by work-related activities under the control of the organization;\n- infrastructure, equipment and materials at the workplace, whether provided by the organization or others (Corporate EHS conducts risk assessments for new equipment);\n- changes or proposed changes in the organization, its activities or materials;\n- modifications to the management system, including temporary changes and their impacts on operations, processes and activities;\n- any applicable legal obligations relating to risk assessment and implementation of necessary controls;\n- the design of work areas, processes, installations, machinery/equipment, operating procedures and work organization, including their adaptation to human capabilities.\n\nWELLBEING\n\nDedicated Wellbeing Program\n\nOn the basis of its 'We All Care' policy on wellbeing, health and safety, signed by all of its senior managers, Stellantis makes the wellbeing of its employees an essential commitment which, beyond its social and ethical dimension, constitutes a win-win stake at the heart of its strategy, to support the company's sustainable performance.\nA DEDICATED PROGRAM: MY WELLBEING\n\nIn July 2022 Stellantis launched a new program dedicated to the wellbeing of all its employees: My Wellbeing. Through this program, that supports the Care pillar in the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, Stellantis has an ambitious vision of its employees' wellbeing, which complements its health and safety fundamentals, occupational health, safety, ergonomics and contributes to making Stellantis a great company to work for.\n\nMY WELLBEING PROGRAM\n\nThe 'My Wellbeing' program is based on five action levers, corresponding to the key components of employees' overall wellbeing:\n\n**My Body**: referring to the employee's physical wellbeing, with a particular focus on promoting actions in favor of health and physical activity.\n\n**My Mind**: in reference to the employee's mental wellbeing, with the aim of taking care of mental health and preventing psychosocial risks, in particular by raising awareness on mindfulness, work/life balance, etc.\n\n**My Job**: dealing with the professional wellbeing of the employee, via career and skills development, managerial skills, by promoting new hybrid ways of working, etc.\nMy Community: related to the social wellbeing of the employee, by developing diversity and inclusion within the company, social relations and networking, notably through volunteering actions, etc.\n\nMy Resources: refers to the financial wellbeing of the employee, notably through total reward approach (compensation and benefits), financial advice, etc.\n\nSport, Fitness and Nutrition\nTo support our workforce in a healthy lifestyle is beneficial for the individual, the Company and society. Stellantis therefore offers a variety of health and nutrition programs, sports groups, training facilities, and coaches. For example, Stellantis sponsors employee sport teams in several global regions, nutrition and wellness coaches are available in North America and several different gaming clubs are offered in China.\n\nBetter Work-Life Balance\nEstablishing a collaborative work method is incorporated into the social dialogue and applies to workspaces as well as the expansion of remote working. The goal is to offer more flexible work arrangements without damaging collective productivity. The New Era of Agility program is an innovative hybrid concept allowing eligible employees to remote work up to 70%. This allows employees to work from home or another location. Enhancing work-life balance leads to better performance and prevents stress as well as adding flexibility across the various regions by reducing commute time.\n\nIn several countries we have established the right to disconnect either in the contracts, charters, policies or internal communications. For example promotion of the fair use of digital tools, making them compatible with health and wellbeing. It comes to ensuring respect of the resting time and professional and personal life balance, avoiding the risk of digital fatigue linked to continuous use of digital means. With this aim, and taking into consideration project New Era of Agility extension, as well as our new modes of work conditioned by the pandemic COVID-19, the Company has set up ten guidelines to be spread to all employees about digital disconnection as well as proper use of electronic devices and digital tools.\n\nCapitalizing on that, the Company willingly offers employees part-time schedules or teleworking arrangements when this is feasible. Where possible, the Company approves employees\u2019 requests to work part-time. The aim is to devise suitable solutions, such as part-time by the day or half day, part-time in hours, etc. Part-time hours are chosen by employees and are not imposed by the Company. In 2022, the Company had 13,655 part-time employees worldwide (including 2,267 employees who worked half-time), distributed as follows: 43% women and 57% men.\n\nIn 2022 635 employees used the possibility to take a sabbatical.\n\nSabbatical\n\n| Number of employees | 1 to 3 months | 4 to 6 months | 7 months to 1 year | Over 1 year |\n|---------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|\n|                     | 202           | 77            | 158               | 198         |\n\nTo support our workforce in a healthy lifestyle is beneficial for the individual, the Company and society.\n\nFor more information refer to 3.2.7\nCompany wide Promotion Events\n\nTo demonstrate the WHS program, two relevant events were held. The first was World Day for Safety and Health at Work on April 28.\n\nThis commemoration organized by the International Labour Organization (ILO), in 2022 focused on: \"To Build a positive Safety & Health Culture, let\u2019s act together\". This theme echoes the Stellantis\u2019 Wellbeing Health and Safety policy, signed by the Company\u2019s top executives. Stellantis employees and managers were asked to make a pledge committing to work safely. This important commitment document was signed globally across the company in 31 countries and 264 sites. At the same time, strong local actions were implemented to support this commemoration. For example: China implemented a webinar related to COVID-19 with some tips to follow during the lockdown in Shanghai. South America organized a specific masterclass related to work remotely and the importance to take in account the ergonomics at home and in Europe a dedicated masterclass was organized for leaders with an expert to talk about the importance of their commitment.\n\nTO BUILD A POSITIVE HEALTH & SAFETY CULTURE, LET\u2019S ACT TOGETHER!\n\nIn October 2022, the second annual We All Care Days event took place:\n\nFour days of information and activities were shared with our employees. Several content, communications and local actions created awareness about relevant topics that impact our level of wellbeing. A focus was laid to increase awareness about topics related to Wellbeing & Motivation, Mental Health and Physical Health. In addition, each Region supported other topics considering the specificities of countries and/or sites. The event was implemented across the company in 33 countries and 351 sites. For instance: South America launched the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) providing Psychological, Social and Financial support to their employees. China reinforced with the employees during the day dedicated to Mental Health their EAP implemented at the begin of the year. Europe and Middle East and Africa implemented the program \"Every Move Counts\" with the objective to promote physical activity. North America deployed 52 local events in the plants.\n### 3.4.8 Detailed Key Performance Indicators\n\n#### 3.4.8.1 Absenteeism* by geographic area and type of benefits\n\n| Year | Sick leaves |

MEETING CHANGING CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS ON MOBILITY\n\nThe automotive market is faced with competition from established players as well as newcomers in the mobility sector, in particular digital and tech companies. It must take into account a variety of different needs and evolving contexts, considering trends such as increasing urbanization and traffic congestion, the need of customers to find mobility solutions going beyond vehicle ownership, and the contributions that technologies can provide to road users in terms of experience and safety. All these elements affect automakers strategy, operations and results as are assessed and challenged by customers and other stakeholders.\n\nStellantis understands these requirements and pays close attention to the mobility trends. We intend to provide opportunities for consumers by developing new mobility solutions with high-quality products and services with the goal to execute flawless customer relationship management.\n\nTo meet market expectations, the Company\u2019s processes and decisions are customer-focused, to design affordable, reliable, safe and high-quality products and services and complementary solutions to meet mobility needs around the world.\n\n4.1 Development of new mobility solutions (including autonomous vehicles)\n\n4.1.1 CONTEXT AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\nCSR issue/challenge #8: Development of new mobility solutions (including autonomous vehicles)\n\nSocial, environmental and technical evolutions impact customer mobility behavior and expectations. Nowadays, vehicles which were traditionally perceived as a tangible asset, are now more likely to be seen as a mobility device, especially by groups such as Millennials and Generation Z who are less interested in owning or driving a vehicle, for economical or ecological reasons and due to their specific mobility needs.\n\nThis evolution has particularly accelerated in recent years and has been embraced by more than just young generations of customers. Since 2020, due to long periods of confinement during the COVID-19 crisis in many countries and the extensive deployment of remote work, one can observe a completely different approach to mobility, with consequences that might have a significant impact in the years to come.\nAt Stellantis, we are aware of these challenges and our business model includes mobility service offerings with Free2move and Leasys. Leasys is the medium- and long-term rental company of FCA Bank \u2013 FCA Bank transferred their interest to LeaseCo a joint venture held 50 percent by both Stellantis and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole. Leasys\u2019 perimeter this year is different from that one of the last year: in the CSR Report of 2021 Leasys included long-, medium- and short-term rental and carsharing, but now Leasys is just medium and long term rental. This because in December 2021, Stellantis and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole announced the acquisition in 2023 by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Consumer Finance of the shares of FCA Bank and Leasys Rent (the company that was included in the 2021 CSR Report\u2019s Leasys perimeter that offered medium- and short-term rental services and carsharing) held by Stellantis; only Leasys, the medium- and long-term rental company, will remain as an equal joint venture between Stellantis and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole. This change is also reflected in the KPIs reported in this year\u2019s CSR Report. Leasys data includes only the low emission vehicles in the fleet and the revenues streams of the low emission vehicles in the fleet of Leasys perimeter which includes only medium- and long-term rental.\n\nFor its part, Free2move (F2M) is a global marketplace offering a range of services to satisfy the multiple travel needs of its customers from one minute to several days or months with carsharing service, short, medium- or long-term rental. One of their goals is to bolster energy transition by helping customers switch to Low Emission Vehicles (LEV) with innovative services such as the subscription offer of Free2move which enable customers to experience an EV on a month-to-month basis and thus will help accelerate EV adoption.\n\nThe Company continues the research and development of technologies in order to develop future mobility options including means of transport such as driverless autonomous vehicles.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nThe importance of individual choice over freedom of movement and flexible mobility means that vehicles have an important place today and in the future. Vehicles play a major role in a multi-modal ecosystem that aims at optimizing the efficiency of transport systems, particularly outside cities where alternative solutions are not always available. New uses and therefore new services are being created.\n\nCarsharing, for example, is a way to support the change in customer behavior from ownership to usage. This shift can be motivated by economic, practical or environmental reasons. Carsharing is also part of the growing concept of intermodality and is a link in the chain between bike-sharing, public transport, etc. It allows customers to rationalize their mobility according to their specific needs. Also, it is a good entry point for users to discover our services and ultimately to use our short-term and middle-term rental services.\n\nShared mobility services as well as Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) platforms will get more efficient as the level of driving automation increases. The purpose of Stellantis: \u201cPowered by our diversity, we lead the way the world moves\u201d means that we want to ensure freedom of movement by providing safe, sustainable, affordable and convenient mobility solutions.\nThis is reflected in the Company\u2019s approach toward connected and autonomous mobility: a gradual development to ensure that reliability and safety requirements are met and to ensure affordability so that our customers and society at large can benefit from it. The Company is aware of these needs and shares its expertise with stakeholders, experts and regulators in the development of the appropriate standardization and regulatory framework. Local governments play a significant role in their climate-neutral and smart cities mission and Stellantis collaborates with these local authorities to expand their sustainability strategies. Stellantis is involved in dedicated conversations with local authorities to promote the kind of regulations needed to support mobility programs.\n\nThe Company is working on a variety of Vehicle to Vehicle/Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2X) applications using both short and long-range technologies as well as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) applications using a wide array of technologies in order to provide connectivity and safety to its customers. Therefore, Stellantis is supportive of in-vehicle data access based on the Extended Vehicle (ExVe), as defined by various ISO Standards, and is in the process of developing a fully industrialized Extended Vehicle Web Server allowing fair, reasonable, non-discriminatory safe and secure access to vehicle data in full compliance with ISO standards.\n\nIn line with the Company\u2019s strategic vision to be not only a vehicle manufacturer but also a mobility services provider, Stellantis is implementing a complete automation roadmap from Level 1 and Levels 2 to 4 (driverless vehicles), based upon clear use cases and customer requirements. We are enhancing the set of features already offered at Level 2 and launching hands-off technology in the U.S. (usually called Level 2+). Level 3 is already under development and the Company sees, beyond Level 3, application of Level 4 technology mainly for shared mobility services like autonomous shuttles, robotaxis and automated goods delivery.\n\nTo support the growing level of autonomy and the high safety demands connected with these technologies, the Company is investing in very advanced simulation and validation methods and creating synergies by pooling databases of relevant safety scenarios and data collected from real world driving conditions, integrated into a state-of-the-art data platform.\n\nStellantis is committed to ensure a sustainable future of mobility also leveraging on new technology and digitalization to reach carbon net zero emissions by 2038.\n\nWith these objectives in mind, Stellantis appointed in September, 2022, a new Chief Digital Information Officer (CDIO), reporting to the Chief Human Resources and Transformation Officer and functionally to the Chief Technology Officer. In this newly created role, the Chief Digital Information Officer will help lead Stellantis\u2019 transformation into a sustainable mobility tech company, driving its digital strategy and technologies. The CDIO will also be responsible for improving IT project execution and organizational efficiency.\n4.1.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\nCommitment scoreboard\n\n| CSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE | VISION/AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | RESULTS |\n|----------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|---------|\n| Development of new mobility solutions (including autonomous vehicles) | Lead innovation for Mobility-as-a-Service to support freedom of movement with affordable, safe and sustainable mobility solutions | % of Low Emission Vehicles (below 50g CO\u2082 per kilometer) in fleeted in the year for carsharing / short- and medium-term rental / subscription / long-term rental (lease) | Short-term | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan) | Long-term | 2022 | 2021 |\n| | | | 2025: 40% | 2030: 60% | 2038: 100% | 17.4% | 12.5% |\n| | | % Revenues from Low Emission Vehicles (below 50g CO\u2082 per kilometer) within Mobility (incl.

Our ability to develop and launch products with new technologies (e.g., electrification, autonomous driving and connected vehicles) to meet regulatory requirements and customer expectations is constantly challenged by technical limitations due to changes in public policies and strong validation efforts needed to ensure availability of systems at a certain time frame.\nDeterioration or disappearance of vehicle brands in favor of new mobility brands\n\nThe automotive industry is in the process of a fundamental transformation and vehicle brands are facing challenges posed by disruptive patterns in mobility choices. In some cities, vehicle ownership is restricted due to traffic congestion and strains on local infrastructure. As automakers navigate this new mobility landscape and play a role in actively shaping this change, it will require the evolution of a century old business model shifting from traditional ownership to customer driven, flexible mobility solutions.\n\nClimate change and environmental issues\n\nOur society is facing increasing challenges resulting from environmental issues: scarcity of resources needed to manufacture EVs, global warming, increased air pollution, etc. Transportation of goods and people is one of the main contributors of the climate crises and accounts for 17 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Through Free2move and Leasys, Stellantis is developing a new way of mobility for people in order to offer them the opportunity to change their way of consuming mobility. By allowing people to switch from property to usage, the Company is creating efficiencies for mobility consumption and thus, is contributing to lower the impact of people\u2019s mobility on the environment.\n\n4.1.3.2 Opportunities\n\nAt the same time, this changing mobility landscape opens opportunities for Stellantis. Mobility transformation is driven by three key trends: electrification of vehicles and alternative powertrains, Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) and Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS). We embrace the challenges posed by this evolution seizing the many opportunities that will invariably accompany change. Stellantis is committed to delivering on our electrification plans, the acceleration of autonomous vehicle and connected technologies and the continued work in developing and defining MaaS offerings through both our Free2move and Leasys services. Advanced autonomous and connected technologies will continue to drive increasing levels of safety with technology that allows users to stay continuously connected while on the move and continued deployment of Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) foreshadowing the autonomous vehicle.\n\nProvide freedom of movement through global mobility brands and enhance the image of the company\n\nAs our mobility brands, Free2move and Leasys bring to Stellantis and its vehicle brands a positive image of flexibility and agile thinking, in line with both current trends and future customers\u2019 needs. Free2move and Leasys are working to define those services that not only meet the needs of individuals and businesses today but also to anticipate the use cases that will drive tomorrow\u2019s mobility. These brands are responsive to B2B and B2C customers in search of change, in a society that is reinventing itself. The continued evolution and adoption of the technologies that enable mobility services and partnerships with other global mobility providers will enhance the perception of Stellantis and its core automotive brands.\nFree2move is the only global mobility marketplace offering a complete and unique ecosystem for its private and professional customers around the world. Relying on data and technology, Free2move puts the customer experience at the heart of the business to reinvent mobility. Free2move offers a range of services to satisfy the multiple travel needs of its customers from one minute to several days or months with carsharing service, short-, medium- and long-term rental or subscription as well as the reservation of ride hailing drivers, parking spaces via the Free2move mobility app. In 2022, Free2move has continued to develop its Mobility Hubs. This all-in-one solution bundles all rental durations in one single app with the same fleet. In July 18, 2022, Free2move announced the completion of the acquisition of SHARE NOW, the market leader and pioneer of free-floating carsharing in Europe allowing the company to become a worldwide mobility leader and expanding its mobility hubs concept to 14 new cities in Europe.\n\nFree2move and SHARE NOW offer altogether carsharing services in 22 cities worldwide (Madrid, Paris, Portland, Washington D.C., Denver, Columbus, Austin, Vienna, Budapest, Copenhagen, Milan, Rome, Turin, Amsterdam, Stuttgart, Berlin, Cologne, Munich, D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg and M\u00fcnster).\n\nLeasys is a medium- and long-term rental operator that provides customers with new vehicles, including a comprehensive selection of optional services that can be configured to fit the diverse nature and set of needs of its customer base. The typical contract duration is from two up to four years.\n\nWithin this activity, sustainability means the development of products designed to charge for effective use of the vehicle and therefore encourage responsible use (i.e., Pay-As-You-Go formulas like Leasys Miles, where a significant proportion of the monthly rental is calculated based on actual distance driven). Sustainability in this area is also promoted through a comprehensive range of services securing timely maintenance of the fleet (and therefore its efficient operation).\n\n- **Leverage fleet electrification and infrastructure to meet consumer demands and regulatory emissions objectives**\n\n  With electrification at the forefront of the global strategy of Stellantis, a significant increase in the availability of public and private charging networks is required to enable wide-scale adoption and increase consumer confidence in EVs. Stellantis through Free2move and Free2move eSolutions is working to provide end-to-end charging and 360\u00b0 charging solutions to simplify private, business and fleet customers charging experience. Through deployed mobility services such as the Free2move Carsharing service, Stellantis will continue to increase the mix of EVs as a percentage of our active fleets.\n\n  As governments adopt policies favorable to electrification, Stellantis can rise to meet the needs and objectives of these programs. As an example, the adoption by the European Commission of \u201cFit for 55\u201d package, to enable the European Union to reduce its net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels and to achieve climate neutrality in 2050, supports the on-going work of Stellantis and NHOA in the largest EV Fastcharging Network in Southern Europe \u2013 operated by Atlante using the technology provided by Free2move eSolutions \u2013 enabled by renewables, energy storage and which is 100% grid integrated.\n\n1 NHOA (formerly Electro Power Systems - Engie EPS) is a global player in energy storage, e-mobility and electric vehicles fastcharging infrastructure.\nIncrease deployment of connected and autonomous vehicle technologies\n\nBringing together expertise in consumer innovations from the sustainable mobility and advanced electronics industries aims at accelerating development timelines to offer innovative in-vehicle user experiences enabled by advanced consumer electronics, Human Machine Interfaces and services that will exceed customer expectations.\n\nThis combination aims to position the Company at the forefront of global efforts to deliver a new frontier of in-cabin information and entertainment capabilities, seamlessly connected inside and outside the vehicles in which they are installed.\n\nIMPACT MEASUREMENT OF THE ELECTRIFICATION STRATEGY\n\nEV adoption can be accelerated by Stellantis mobility services to facilitate the use of EVs and to foster customer acceptance. Stellantis automotive subscription programs such as Free2move Car on Demand, enable customers to experience an EV on a month-to-month basis. Stellantis carsharing programs such as Free2move Carsharing provide additional opportunities for consumers to experience an EV on a short-duration basis as we continue to increase the mix of EVs in these fleets. In addition, the launch in France of the innovative \u201cElectric As You Go\u201d pay-per-use offer introduces a new way to easily access BEVs, with a competitive pricing based on car usage. Free2move eSolutions and Leasys are also working to facilitate the charging experience. In 2022, the new eSolutions Charging App enables users to find a compatible and available charging station from a European network of approximately 405,000 charging stations (versus 250,000 in 2021).\n\nSustainable mobility goes beyond simply the electrification of the fleet and seeks to align the diverse needs of a community with an inclusive, affordable approach which maximizes the utilization of existing assets. Leasys and Free2move have developed pay-per-use models where consumers and businesses pay for actual miles driven. Combined with asset sharing programs this has the double benefit of lowering mobility costs for our customers and maximizing vehicle utilization.\n\nIn 2022, these initiatives have met with favorable market response and the number of infleeted LEVs was 61,304 (versus 49,800 in 2021) representing 17.4% of total vehicles infleeted in the year (versus 12.5% in 2021). The development of LEVs through Stellantis\u2019 mobility brands enhances the ability to respond to evolving customer expectations and supports environmentally conscious consumers looking for alternatives to car ownership. Electrification also enables the emergence of new services, such as the already available Citro\u00ebn Ami. These services are further reinforced through our Free2move eSolutions (F2MeS) joint venture with NHOA. This partnership is already in the process of developing a fast charging network in Europe which will reinforce the synergy between electrification and mobility services.\n\nFor more information refer to 4.1.7.1.2\n\nCharging stations in Europe\n\n405,000\n+62% versus 2021\n\nInfleeted LEVs\n\n61,300\n17.4% of total vehicles infleeted\n\nFor more information refer to 2.5.3.2.3\n4.1.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nStellantis\u2019 portfolio is uniquely suited to offer distinctive, sustainable mobility solutions to meet its customers\u2019 evolving needs, as they embrace electrification, connectivity, autonomous driving and shared ownership.\n\nThe Company\u2019s mobility programs are led globally by the CEO of Free2move and Chairman of Leasys. Each of the organizations is responsible for setting overall strategies to address the needs of our customers through hypothesis, testing, implementation and adaptation. Stellantis Business Labs organization is designed to detect, test and transform opportunities into marketable products and services for Stellantis which for instance led to the launch of Free2move Car On Demand.\n\nStellantis has created a new Business Unit, Mobilisights, which is fully dedicated to developing data as a service business and specialized B2B data products and services. Stellantis is forming this Business Unit to enable accelerated growth in a fast-growing market through a specialized entity with commercial capabilities. The CEO of the new entity will work with a designated leadership team and report to the Chief Software Officer.\n\nAutonomous vehicle programs are jointly led by the technology EVPs (Chief Technology, Chief Engineering and Chief Software Officers) all members of the Top Executive Team. Investment decisions are considered by the Strategy Council of Stellantis. The Board of Directors is informed of the advances that the Company makes on autonomous technology. With support of the global leadership, each region is responsible for adapting global strategies to align with the local context.\n\nA dedicated Software division led by the Chief Software Officer, a member of the Top Executive Team, supports the shift to become a sustainable mobility tech company and to expand the options customers have to add innovative features and services, while transforming how they interact with vehicles.\n\nThe Chief Software Officer operates in a very close cooperation with the Chief Engineer Officer and the Chief Technical Officer to plan, design and deliver technical solutions to customers.\n\n4.1.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nStellantis is a leading global automaker and mobility provider dedicated to promoting a new era of sustainable mobility and to protecting the freedom of movement of all - with distinctive, affordable and efficient transportation solutions uniquely positioned to capture the exciting opportunities of a global industry undergoing rapid and profound change. Guided by our Corporate Purpose - Powered by our diversity, we lead the way the world moves -, our strategy combines technological development with the expansion of mobility services offered to our private and business customers to address their evolving needs.\n\nWe embrace a culture of discontinuity to leverage our combined 200 years of automotive experience as a backdrop to innovation which pushes the definition of the traditional automotive company towards a world of dynamic change. While the technologies that underpin the rapid change in automobiles continue to mature, we must rethink the way in which our customers and stakeholder access and interact with transportation systems.\nMobility services support our climate neutrality ambition\n\nWithin the context of global climate change challenge, Free2move and Leasys believe that the mobility industry has a responsibility to minimize its CO\u2082 footprint and recognize their responsibilities, as leading mobility operators, to lead the transition towards a more sustainable mobility system.\n\nFree2move and Leasys recognize the necessary shift from Internal Combustion Engine vehicles towards alternative, electric powertrains in support of the targets set by the Paris Agreement as well as the climate-related United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals. They embrace these international goals and, with the aim to reduce substantially CO\u2082 emissions, are committed to contribute to consumers\u2019 transition towards cleaner technologies and therefore, ultimately, to the long-term sustainability of their activities.\n\nFree2move operates a LEV-rich carsharing platform (partly electrified in Europe and ICE in the U.S.) providing a fully-digital urban alternative. In the same way, LEVs are available through an automotive subscription programs providing an ideal opportunity for consumers to test these emerging technologies. Free2move e-Solutions is also providing access to a network of 405,000 charging stations in Europe in 2022 (versus 250,000 in 2021). These examples are a testimony of Free2move e-Solutions\u2019 sense of responsibility and determination to contribute and accelerate the on-going transition to electric, more sustainable, forms of mobility.\n\n4.1.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nStellantis offers a wide range of affordable mobility services in response to the new uses and different mobility needs of businesses and individuals. These services are offered through Free2move, Leasys and their partners.\n\n4.1.6.1 Free2move and Leasys: the brands dedicated to connected and mobility services\n\nStellantis delivers mobility offers through Free2move and Leasys, devoted to putting the customer experience at the heart of business strategy in order to reinvent mobility and facilitate the transition to e-mobility.\n\nFree2move is the mobility tech brand offering a complete and unique ecosystem for its private and professional customers around the world and specifically in Europe and U.S. Relying on data and technology, the digitization of services allows Free2move to adapt to large urban centers according to the needs of each user. By creating Mobility Hubs, Free2move provides a new ecosystem that improves mobility conditions for B2C and B2B2C customers. Among the different travel solutions of the Free2move application, users can choose the best mode of transportation, depending on their travel need: carsharing, rental from 1 minute to several months, car with drivers (Ride hailing), parking space etc.\n\nTo meet business needs, Free2move has consolidated cutting-edge expertise around data through digital technology. The services reduce the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and carbon footprint of fleets (Connect Fleet, PHEV Connect, E-Mobility Advisor, Multi brand services). Free2move has also developed a range of solutions to support customers in the transition towards the use of EVs (i.e., eSolutions Charging App and future developments around fast charging and V2G).\nLeasys\u2019 offer has expanded in recent years to include a broad range of services addressing the specific needs of B2C and B2B customers. Leasys\u2019 product development has been awarded consecutively from 2019 to 2021 the \u201cProduct of the Year\u201d in the Automotive Services (Italy) category.\n\nThe sustainability of Leasys\u2019 offer is represented by inclusive solutions making its mobility offer increasingly accessible through products designed for discontinuous drivers (Leasys\u2019 pay-per-use solutions such as Leasys Miles) as well as drivers that need to travel without limitation in terms of kilometers (unlimited product dedicated to LEV).\n\nMoreover Leasys offers Be Safe in the market, a long-term rental service, created in 2022 in partnership with an insurance company in Italy. By subscribing to the insurance, Be Safe provides economic coverage of expenses up to six rental fees in the event of job loss, permanent disability from injury and hospitalization for serious illness.\n\nMobility business accelerating\n\nFREE2MOVE IS ACCELERATING ITS GROWTH\n\nFree2move has developed its Mobility Hubs which offer flexible rental services, all available with the same fleet. Mobility Hubs are opened in the U.S, in Washington D.C., Portland, Denver and Austin and in Europe, in Madrid (Spain) and Paris (France). With the acquisition of SHARE NOW in 2022, 15 more cities in Europe will be integrated. Extended Mobility Hubs are also available through franchisees in 11 countries (France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Portugal, Belgium, Austria, the United Kingdom, Slovenia, Greece and the U.S.) with the objectives to extend our services to 200 cities in 2030.\n\nStellantis Ventures will act as a strategic investor and help startups integrate new technologies within the Company in compressed timeframes \u2013 allowing the adoption within months versus years. Investments will not only impact Stellantis\u2019 efforts around sustainability, competitiveness and in-vehicle technology but will also transform customer experiences around vehicle marketing, sales and finance.\n\nAnnounced as part of Stellantis\u2019 Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, Stellantis Ventures is committed to supporting aspiring entrepreneurs and fostering innovation driven by customer satisfaction, sustainability and a comprehensive portfolio of mobility technology.\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\nStellantis Ventures Launches with \u20ac300 Million Fund to Propel Innovation Uptake\n\nhttps://www.stellantis.com/en/news/press-releases/2022/march/stellantis-ventures-launches-with-300-million-fund-to-propel-innovation-uptake\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\nFree2move is defining the future of mobility\n\nhttps://www.free2move.com/en-US/press/press-release-2023-01-05#:~:text=By%20the%20end%20of%202023%2C%20rent%2C%20and%20subscription%20services.\nDEFINING THE FUTURE OF MOBILITY\n\nMoving a customer is a great responsibility, and Free2move is positioned to empower customers with new technology to embrace new mobility options and meet every evolving customer demand. Free2move will be 360\u00b0 multimodal, the user will be able to describe his need to the Free2move Smart Assistant, that will propose him several options based on cost and time and depending on his needs and traffic context during the day.\n\nHaving secured their place as a leader in mobility, Free2move is now defining the future of the industry, combining achievements in transportation with advanced technology for an optimized customer experience. People in urban environments are no longer using a sole mode of transportation. They combine subways with carsharing, perhaps own a small vehicle for everyday use and rent larger SUVs for road trips and weekend getaways. In line with these new market demands, Free2move will continue to increase their offering and modes of transportation via their single app, for a customer experience designed to take anyone anywhere, quickly and easily for the true freedom ease of travel provides.\n\n4.1.6.2 Autonomous Driving\n\nIn this new era of mobility, Stellantis portfolio of brands is uniquely positioned to offer distinctive and sustainable solutions to meet the evolving needs of customers, as they embrace electrification, connectivity and autonomous driving.\n\nThe goal of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD) is to increase the safety of the vehicle and to help the driver in the everyday tasks of driving.\n\nSafety systems such as Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB), Lane Keeping Assists (LKA) or Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) are able to provide significant benefit of accident reduction (from 10 to 30% depending on location and technical definition) and are available on the majority of new Stellantis vehicles. Each new car generation provides new and enhanced functions for safety improvements.\n\nThe other interest of ADAS for customers is to help the driver by providing assistance to reduce the fatigue, mental load and provide comfort during the driving journey or parking situation. For example, Adaptive Cruise Control and Lane Centering / Positioning assistance systems provide automatic steering, braking and acceleration of the vehicle, while Automated Parking Assist detects parking lot and perform the full parking maneuver. Another example is an Automated Navigation system capable of autonomously performing address-to-address driving, including handling highway lane changes, interchanges, and split/merge scenarios. Automated driving capabilities are also beginning to extend into semi-urban and urban settings, with various degrees of intersections handling. At this stage, in mass consumer vehicles, the driver still has to monitor the environment of the vehicle but can drive feet off and on certain conditions hands off the steering wheel. Stellantis already provides a complete suite of ADAS for most of its vehicles, on all segments and locations.\n\nStellantis has already implemented Feet off in its vehicles worldwide, hands off at very low speed also (Full Automated Park Assist) and plan to implement hands off L2+ in the near future.\nAutonomous Driving is the next step of ADAS: driver has the possibility to do secondary tasks (reading e-mail, watching videos etc), to significantly improve the user\u2019s experience during the travel with a delegation of the complete driving task to the autonomous system. Ultimately, autonomous driving technology will improve people\u2019s mobility and goods delivery by providing new services based on autonomous taxi, shuttles and commercial vehicles.\n\nAutonomous vehicle and ADAS technology demonstrates the ability of vehicle systems to take over an increasing number of tasks which are currently performed by the driver. SAE International (SAE) developed a classification system that defines the degree of driving automation a vehicle and its equipment may offer. The levels span from zero to five, ranging from vehicles without this technology to entirely self-driving vehicles.\n\n**SAE LEVELS OF DRIVING AUTOMATION**\n\n| Level | Description | Responsibility |\n|-------|-------------|----------------|\n| 0     | You are driving | You must drive |\n| 1     | These are driver support features | These features are limited to providing warnings and momentary assistance |\n| 2     | These are automated driving features | These features provide steering OR brake/acceleration support to the driver |\n| 3     | You are not driving | When the feature request is made, you must drive |\n| 4     | These features provide steering AND brake/acceleration support to the driver | These automated driving features will not require you to take over driving |\n| 5     | You are not driving | These automated driving features will not require you to take over driving |\n\n\u00a9 2021 SAE International\nA new Level 2+ is also emerging on the market as an intermediate system before full automation (Level 3 and above). There is no formal definition of Level 2+, such that different approaches are currently being taken by different automakers. In some cases, Level 2+ refers to enhancements of driving capabilities/maneuvers and extensions of operational design domains compared to Level 2, but with the driver still fully responsible and required to maintain eyes on the road and hands on the wheel and feet \u201coff\u201d with braking and acceleration controlled by the system. In other approaches, the Level 2+ system allows the driver to take the hands off of the steering wheel to improve the driving comfort for a more specific set of driving maneuvers and operating conditions, such as during long travels on highways that mostly require Automated Cruise Control (ACC) and lane centering functionality for extended periods of time. In the near term, Stellantis plans to launch such a Level 2+ system in the U.S. (it should be noted that ADAS European and Chinese regulations do not allow Level 2+ hands off driving at the current time).\n\nTo offer those new functions and services that improve the mobility experience and provide greater access to affordable solutions, the Company organization is set up to pursue a multi-partner strategy for developing advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving technologies, working with leaders in their respective industries.\n\nConsidering the challenges and opportunities presented by the advances in autonomous driving and connectivity, we are devoting resources to research and develop an approach to address changing consumer expectations driven by growing demand for safety, convenience, connectivity and quality time.\n\nOur ongoing partnerships include major technology players in autonomous driving.\n\nIn 2022, we further strengthened our ongoing partnership in the area of Automated Driving:\n\n- the co-development project with BMW of a platform which will allow Stellantis to support features from Level 2, Level 2+ and Level 3 across a wide range of vehicles and geographies.\n- the Waymo cooperation on Level 4 autonomy has been extended to include light commercial vehicles specific use cases, which could bring several new business opportunities to the market.\n\nIn addition, Stellantis will include the upgrade over-the-air (OTA) of ADAS and Autonomous Driving functions for its future vehicles, leveraging the capabilities provided by new centralized ADAS hardware and architecture.\n\nThe non-binding memorandum of understanding signed with Foxconn in 2021, aims at developing four families of chips that will cover over 80% of the Company\u2019s micro-controllers needs, helping to greatly simplify the supply chain. Adoption and installation of products into Stellantis vehicles is targeted by 2024.\n\nStellantis also has particular focus on validation and safety, which are key for being able to put highly automated driving features on the market. Many important research institutes are involved with Stellantis in this field (i.e., SystemX and VEDECOM in France). Stellantis also leverages several major cooperative funded projects such as L3Pilot (project finished in 2021 on level 3 driving pre-deployment project), HiDrive (in use monitoring of driver for Level 3), successors of PEGASUS in Germany (Set Level 4 to 5, etc.) and SAM (Scenario database for ADAS and Autonomous driving Level 3) in France.\n\nSeveral projects are also in place for the development of the technologies on autonomous driving and connectivity such as Imagine (V2X) in Germany and C-ROADS (V2X), Mise VeDi 2025 and Mise Scala AD in Europe.\nIn addition, the Joint Research Laboratory (Joint LAB), with Valeo and Safran on Artificial Intelligence for Driving Automation (Level 2/Level 3) is noteworthy among our current research partnerships.\n\nStellantis N.V. and Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. announced a multi-year technology collaboration to utilize the latest Snapdragon\u00ae Digital Chassis advancements to deliver intelligent, customizable and immersive in-vehicle experiences to millions of vehicles across Stellantis\u2019 14 iconic automotive brands beginning in 2024.

This agreement will facilitate Stellantis\u2019 plan to merge all software domains into High Performance Computers, leveraging the high-performance, low-power Snapdragon Automotive Platforms across all major vehicle domains as well as contribute to securing Stellantis\u2019 supply chain on strategic components.\n\nNew Tech Platforms Coming in 2024\nThe heart of the transformation to customer-centric services is the new electrical/electronic (E/E) and software architecture. Three new tech platforms are expected to be deployed in 2024, at scale, across the four vehicle platforms of Stellantis over the following two years:\n\n- **STLA Brain** planned to be fully OTA capable, with 30 modules addressed, versus 10 today, making it highly flexible. It is a service-oriented architecture that aims to be fully integrated with the cloud that connects electronic control units within the vehicle with the vehicle\u2019s central high performing computer (HPC) via a high-speed data bus. It is designed to breaks today\u2019s bond between hardware and software generations, enabling software developers to create and update features and services quickly without waiting for a new hardware launch. These OTA updates should allow us to dramatically reduce costs for both the customers and Stellantis, simplify maintenance for the user and sustain vehicle residual values.\n\n- **STLA SmartCockpit**, to be built on top of STLA Brain, is intended to seamlessly integrate with the digital lives of vehicle occupants to create a customizable third living space. STLA SmartCockpit is built in collaboration with Amazon\u2019s automotive offering \u2013 Amazon Digital Cabin which aims at bringing scalable and modular software platform for cockpit applications. The development of SmartCockpit is done leveraging the Mobile Drive joint venture between Stellantis and Foxconn. STLA SmartCockpit is expected to be cloud first and designed to deliver always refreshed content and services leveraging 5G connectivity. STLA SmartCockpit will deliver AI based experiences in the field of Navigation, Voice Assistance, e-Com market place and payment services.\n\n- **STLA AutoDrive** is being developed in partnership with BMW, to offer Level 2, Level 2+ and Level 3 autonomous driving capabilities and with continuous upgrades through OTA updates.\n\nCollege teams competed in the first Stellantis Hackathon in Detroit at the end of April 2022; winning team awarded $15,000. Teams used cloud based Stellantis software development kit (SDK), vehicle data to create apps that \u201cgamify\u201d driving to encourage safety, fuel efficiency.\n\nSoftware-defined vehicles play a key role in Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan with 34 million monetizable connected cars on the road by 2030.\nIMPACT MEASUREMENT OF SOFTWARE STRATEGY\n\nTo support the development of mobility services, including via autonomous driving, Stellantis endeavors to deploy its next-generation tech platforms, building on existing connected vehicle capabilities to generate approximately \u20ac20 billion in incremental annual revenues by 2030.\n\nThis transformation will move Stellantis\u2019 vehicles from today\u2019s dedicated electronic architectures to an open software-defined platform that seamlessly integrates with customers\u2019 digital lives.\n\n4.1.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nSTELLANTIS HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM SOLUTIONS\n\n4.1.7.1 Overall Mobility Solutions and Services\n\nFree2move and Leasys offer a variety of mobility services to B2C and B2B customers in some European countries and for Free2move in the U.S. too.

As an illustration of these risks, the results of one of our surveys (refer to items 1 and 2) show that the more problems a vehicle has the less likely it is that a customer will remain loyal to the brand.\n\n1. Survey results regarding the relationship between incidents and product quality satisfaction score\n\nCustomers are asked to provide their experience during the first 90 days of vehicle ownership.\n\nWe can see that a customer who has not had a vehicle problem within the first 90 days gives a 9.00 average satisfaction score while a customer who has had three problems gives a 7.77 average satisfaction score.\n\nImpact of number of problem on Overall satisfaction (OSAT) score\n\nScope of the survey: Results May 2021\nAll brands sold in the five major markets in Europe: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom\nDeliveries between September 2019 and August 2020\nQuestionnaire sent to customers after three months of ownership\n2. Survey results regarding the relationship between loyalty and product quality\n\nWhen customers experience problems with their vehicles, we risk losing brand loyalty, which becomes a negative financial impact for Stellantis. The probability of a customer repurchasing the same brand as their previous vehicle is:\n\n- 23% when a satisfaction score of 5 is given for their previous vehicle;\n- 50% when a satisfaction score of 9 is given for their previous vehicle.\n\nImpact of OSAT with the previous car on Loyalty to the brand\n\nScope of the survey: Results May 2021\nAll brands, European Market 5 countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom)\nDeliveries between September 2019 and August 2020\nQuestionnaire sent to customers after 3 months of ownership\n3. Survey results regarding the relationship between loyalty to the brand and aftersales satisfaction\n\nWhen customers have a positive aftersales service experience, the potential for loyalty to the brand and official dealers\u2019 network is increased.\n\nHigher customer satisfaction with the service experience leads to higher brand loyalty rates.\n\n2021 U. S.

Power Power Information Network (PIN) trade-in VIN data matched to 2020 CSI Study\n4.2.3.2 Opportunities\n\nFeedback is an important part of the process to develop improvements. Applying the findings from customer surveys supports decisions on the most beneficial way to deploy resources.\n\n**Stellantis has the opportunity to strengthen customer satisfaction regarding vehicle and service quality.**\n\nWe work to develop and implement initiatives that are designed to create a positive customer experience. We are implementing several innovative initiatives to attract and retain customers.\n\n- **Innovation in manufacturing quality**\n  \n  To support the continuous improvement approach to the quality of our products, Stellantis has implemented an innovation based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. These improvements have made it possible to automate various control stations throughout the production line, vehicle and mechanical component factories to verify the quality of the manufacturing process.\n\n- **Product predictive maintenance**\n  \n  We work consistently on anticipating failures such as ones requiring towing, and more quickly identifying the root cause of complex failures. The goal is that the vehicle spends as little time as possible at the dealership and that the customer is more satisfied.\n\n- **Used vehicle e-commerce solution**\n  \n  A used vehicle purchase module has been developed to provide customers speed, fluidity and transparency in the used vehicle purchase process.\n\n4.2.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nThe Customer Experience organization represents the customer\u2019s voice inside Stellantis, and it is their mission to satisfy the customer\u2019s expectations. The Chief Customer Experience Officer is an EVP member of the Top Executive Team and the Strategy Council. The Officer has the responsibility to decide when vehicles meet the needs of customers and are ready to be sold around the world. The Officer defines quality targets for product and services and the mid-term plan, which covers three years, and is reviewed with the Top Executive Team twice a year to ensure we are challenging ourselves to meet the ever-changing market. To meet these targets around the world, the Chief Customer Experience Officer delegates the authority to local Business Units and plant Directors to capture their market needs and expedite the results.\n\nThe authority is defined in the Quality Policy, which governs the teams throughout the whole value chain: from the design of our products and our services, to the support of each of our customers, everywhere in the world.\nTo ensure that the Quality Policy is applied, the Quality Management System (QMS) is used to identify the requirements linked to quality results. These requirements are the basis for the Company\u2019s operational processes and quality standards, which are continuously improved. The results from the field assessments support the conclusion that the QMS is efficient and makes it possible to identify improvement actions.\n\nThe heads of Customer Experience of the divisions and the regions control the implementation of the Quality Policy and are responsible for their QMS. They involve all the players with whom the Company works with in the extended company such as suppliers, industrial partners, subsidiaries, importers and commercial networks to ensure the achievement of Quality results. Each region reports its results during the monthly Business Review led by the CEO.\n\nIn manufacturing \u2013 in compliance with the regulatory requirements of the countries or regions in which we operate \u2013 Stellantis plants are certified according to the standards:\n\n- ISO 9001 for vehicle manufacturing plants;\n- ISO 9001 or IATF 16949 for powertrain and raw materials plants.\n\nThe Company\u2019s quality governance is global:\n\n- the Chief Customer Experience Officer manages the Corporate Customer Experience Division, oversees the Heads of Customer Experience of the regions, brands, and other corporate divisions, and ensures that the Company meets its quality objectives;\n- the Customer Experience teams in the Company Divisions oversee operational managers, provide technical guidelines that include expectations to reach quality targets in all regions;\n- the Customer Experience teams in the regions are in charge of the quality of the region\u2019s products and services, as well as plants and points of sale.\n\nMembers of the Top Executive Team, including the Chief Customer Experience Officer, identify and confirm the strategic quality ambitions and guide the quality initiatives of the Business Units and regions. Stellantis has set quality targets consistent with its ambition in customer satisfaction. The Customer Experience Division performs internal and external communication throughout the year to disseminate the concept of being customer-centric through technical and soft skills training, supplier quality meetings and internal communication channels.\n\n### 4.2.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nThe Stellantis Quality Policy was signed by the CEO and communicated to employees worldwide.\n\nManagers have to ensure that everyone on their team is aware of the policy and implements the actions to support it within their scope.\nFor Stellantis, being Number 1 means: being the best in customer satisfaction with excellent quality vehicles, services and mobility, providing a seamless customer journey, worldwide. This includes:\n\n- Customer Experience being at top level.\n- Targeting zero defects on products and zero complaints regarding the services for our brands.\n- Sustainable quality throughout the product life cycle.\n- Exemplary responsiveness to customer feedback.\n\nAll Stellantis brands compete to be Number 1 in syndicated surveys in all their major markets.\n\nThrough our Quality Policy, we commit to implement actions to reach this ambition.\n\nThe commitment of everyone to think \"Quality FIRST\": we are a customer-centric Company focused on providing best-in-class customer experience through our behavior, decisions and actions, at all levels of the Company. For example:\n\n- We define the quality objectives in the planning phase program of new products and new services.\n- At each step, we check the conformity of the result with the defined requirements.\n- We react immediately to defects, whenever these defects are detected: when the vehicle is still in our hands or after the vehicle has been handed over.\n- We capitalize on the analysis of our findings to avoid recurrence and to improve our performance.\n\nWe also engage our suppliers and our partners in achieving our quality ambitions:\n\n- By associating them directly in the analysis of issues and risks in a timely manner.\n- By being responsible and accountable for the quality of their deliverables at each phase of development.\n- By not hesitating to be intrusive and to escalate if necessary.\n\nStellantis has an operational Quality Management System. It is a sustainable means to achieve our Quality Ambition.\n\nThe Stellantis Quality Management System (QMS):\n\n- Defines the quality requirements for the processes in our value chain.\n- Defines the quality fundamentals whose rigorous application makes it possible to achieve the results.\n\nWe apply our Quality Policy throughout the Company\u2019s value chain, from the design of our products and services to the support of our customers, whether digital or physical, anywhere in the world.\n\nStellantis employees are engaged from early phases such as strategy, planning and programming to sales and after-sales, for our products, services and mobility services.\nOur collective engagement is supervised by qualified people with high level technical and managerial skills. The Customer Experience Department is an independent function of Stellantis focused on compliance with the commitments made for Quality. Each manager, including those in the commercial networks, is responsible for ensuring compliance with standards, the conformity of results and the performance of processes within their scope.\n\nA team of professional auditors performs internal audits to control the right roll out, application and consistency of results of the QMS standards. Action plans are implemented and followed up when issues are identified.\n\n4.2.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nIn accordance with our policy, quality is everyone\u2019s business. To make this be a reality, Stellantis employees have regular trainings and receive guiding information.\n\nStellantis has implemented a common approach to skills, with an aim to better allow the Company to be more sustainable in anticipating changes and identifying the required competences.\n\nThis approach is centered on 15 global job families. The quality job family covers the activities to ensure that every customer\u2019s journey with Stellantis\u2019 products and services is world class. To achieve the ambition to be Number 1 and be a customer-centric company, Stellantis focuses on the following:\n\n- Definition of the processes, product and service quality targets to respond to the customers\u2019 expectations.\n- Implementation of the Quality Management System, methods, and guidelines.\n- Management of all quality objectives throughout the definition, production, product and service life cycles in all regions.\n\n700 employees in the corporate Customer Experience division and 12,600 (including hourly people working in plants) in the quality job family act directly, in their everyday job, for the customer satisfaction.\n\n4.2.6.1 Resources deployed to improve the quality of products\n\nOur target being to ensure a total satisfaction of our customers, Stellantis employees respect the quality requirements and apply the quality processes defined for each and every step of the value creation chain (design and development, manufacturing, sales and aftersales, etc. including suppliers management).\n\nDesign and engineering phase\n\nThe shape, style and lines of a vehicle are direct contributors to the sale of vehicles and based on customer perception of quality. Finish, robustness, and the materials used inside and outside, play an important role in the customer\u2019s perception of quality. Perceived quality is a major factor in a customer\u2019s purchasing decision. Stellantis aims to position each future model at the highest customer satisfaction level of each of its automotive brands. More than 1,500 characteristics have been identified, which contribute to the impression of perceived quality. Specific evaluation tools and technical benchmarks are used to drive vehicle projects to the expected quality level.\nPerformance and reliability during use of the vehicle\n\nQuality of product performance is based on customer expectations for a given segment, enriched by the brand experience it conveys. Around 40 different main standards e.g., visibility, seat comfort, etc., are defined for verification. The Company strives to position each future model among or above the best for customer satisfaction within its competitive segment. For initial quality and reliability, Stellantis strives for achieving the highest level delivered to the customer. Several well-structured preventive processes are applied at each step including design, development and manufacturing within the Company and from suppliers. Design considers the specific usage of products in all selling regions with appropriate endurance driving sessions to simulate and better understand specific vehicle performance over time.\n\nSolving issues during use of vehicle\n\nIn order to mitigate impact on customers\u2019 satisfaction, Stellantis is closely monitoring lead time to fix an issue in the field so that affected vehicles are quickly repaired at the dealership, and production of new vehicles is secured to avoid inconvenience and claims from new customers.\n\nTo minimize the lead time of issues, Stellantis has set up a cross functional team with experts from Customer Experience, Engineering, Vehicle Programs, Aftersales, Manufacturing, and Purchasing activities to implement a fast-track process to speed up the resolution of issues in the field.\n\nThe Cross Functional Team has set up a dedicated process called Reactivity Acceleration for Customer Enthusiasm (RACE), which accelerates root causes analysis and solution implementation.\n\nSince implementation in mid-2020, RACE process has reduced by half the average lead time of resolution for the most impacting design issues.\n\nQuality-in-use to preserve value of the vehicle\n\nQuality-in-use criteria encompasses the aesthetic, aging of materials, tolerance of harsh treatment resulting from daily use, and functional aspects like background noises and loss of minor performances. Stellantis improves vehicle quality in order to reduce signs of aging and wear and tear, with the intention for the vehicle to look as close to new after years of customer usage as possible. This has an important impact on the resale value which is a significant pillar for customers and the Company. Specific vehicle aging tests are conducted to improve the baseline design requirements and to manage the aging of the vehicle over time to improve the scope of usage and strengthen the resale value.\nCOMPANY TRANSFORMATION THROUGH THE SOFTWARE STRATEGY\n\nStellantis\u2019 vehicles transformation to an open software-defined architecture greatly expands the options customers will have to add innovative features and services via regular over-the-air (OTA) updates keeping vehicles fresh, exciting, and updated years after they have been built.\n\nThose OTA updates are expected to be available quickly without waiting for a new hardware, and dramatically reduce costs for both the customers and Stellantis, simplify maintenance for the user and sustain vehicle residual values.\n\nDurability for long-term use\n\nCustomers expect a vehicle that ages well and does not incur excessive future expenditure. Durability is the performance of the vehicle over time, factoring in the variability of customer use. The goal is to ensure product performance without major loss of functionality over time and without breakdown or defect. The Company is aiming to be in a leading role in quality as one of the major pillars that leads to customer satisfaction. Stellantis has set up a continuous improvement process to target the best-in-class position in durability for each product or sub-system.\n\nManufacturing quality\n\nThe manufacturing quality system is based on the Stellantis Production Way (SPW):\n\n- The Company controls the quality at the workstation, in some production quality gates during the process and in the final inspection line to ensure the quality level of the manufactured vehicle. There are 1,800 functional and aesthetic characteristics checked on every vehicle.\n- Vehicles are tested daily by professional operators in static and driving tests on specially designed tracks and on roads outside the plant.\n- The Customer Experience division ensures plant audits in order to verify requirements.\n\nThe processes and KPIs follow the Company\u2019s reference standards. To achieve the highest quality level in all manufacturing plants, best practices based on practical lessons learned have been identified.\n\nSo far, plants are in the growth phase; best practices implementation is in progress and followed up by action plans.\n\nSupplier quality management and development\n\nThe Company\u2019s Purchasing Department works to ensure supplier quality management and development by:\n\n- usage of an Advanced Product Quality Planning and a Production Part Approval Process;\n- checking key processes and certifications such as critical supplier management;\ndefining supplier KPIs such as warranty performance;\n\n- a supplier surveillance system with defined countermeasures and permanent personal contact with each supplier manufacturing location.\n\nOur approach is global, and actions are adapted to the most demanding customer expectations, taking into account regional wants and needs, in order to handle perceived quality, quality-in-use and durability of our products. The same analysis, processing and feedback standards are also applied for vehicles produced by our joint ventures.\n\n4.2.6.2 Strategy and means deployed for a high-level quality of service and customer experience\n\nStellantis aims to provide an experience that delights each customer by:\n\nThe excellence of the relationship throughout the customer journey\n\n- The customer\u2019s journey with our brands begins well upstream of the act of purchase and continues throughout the use of the vehicle or mobility service. Through digital and physical interactions with the brand, the customer can discover the product or the mobility service and become interested in it before committing to purchase. The relationship with the brand continues throughout the use of the vehicle or the service.\n\n- The quality of service covers the entire relationship between the customer and the Company. The entire journey is a major contributor to the excellence of the customer experience at every point of contact.\n\n- To achieve this quality of service, the Customer Experience function relies on teams and systems in each region.\n\nHigh-level operational skills for the service of customers\n\n- The business centers describe the tasks for zone managers and each key function of the dealership. In a sales team, for example, this includes dealership personnel such as the sales manager, sales assistant, sales consultant, and delivery manager.\n\n- Since 2018, to strengthen the customer-centric and interaction-centric mind-set, special attention has been paid to training sales advisors on behavioral skills, an essential complement to expertise and application of working standards.\n\n- The training policy applies to key sales and technical positions at the point of sale. In 2022, the dealer networks provided 7.4 million hours of training (classroom and remote).\n\n- The accreditation program is an international program intended for all personnel in contact with customers, performed by our retailers, that assesses technical and behavioral skills.\n\nApplying efficient processes to achieve results\n\nTo ensure the application of processes and the achievement of results:\n\n- Within each point of sale, each manager conducts checks on the application of standards which are complemented by Zone Manager internal audits.\n\n- External audits are carried out annually on the application of operational standards.\nFrequent mystery call and shopping provides evaluation and opportunities to demonstrate respect for the customer experience and behaviors desired by brands.\n\nYearly internal audits are conducted by the Customer Experience team. Deviations identified during these audits are the subject of action plans, which are monitored at local and country levels. New processes are evaluated to measure knowledge of the customer experience, including shopper survey and Quality Observer.\n\nManagement of the quality of service provided in each country\nThe Stellantis roadmap is defined for the period 2022-2030. This roadmap makes it possible to steer the convergence and achievement of our objectives.\n\nEach country is responsible for its annual Quality of Service Plan, structured around main actions:\n\n- Assessment of skills and implementation of training plans.\n- Deployment of operational standards in each point of sale, standards which embody and guarantee all the requirements of the brands, which each point of sale must comply with.\n- Quality control delivered by each point of sale, and reduction of dispersion between points of sale.\n- Treatment of deviations identified during checks and audits.\n\nThe identification of gaps makes it possible to define the priority actions to be implemented to achieve the objectives.\n\nThe annual Quality of Service Plan for each country is monitored by the Regions with the support of the Corporate Functions; its day-to-day animation is handled by the monthly Country Quality Committees.\n\nThe quality of service is one of the major components of the sales policy applied by us in each country with its sales and after-sales network.\n\nA structured system for listening to the voice of customers throughout the journey\nTo monitor its quality of service, Stellantis relies on a vast survey system:\n\n- Benchmark surveys concerning the purchase and delivery of the vehicle and after-sales interventions, carried out in most of the countries where the Company operates, to position each brand vis-\u00e0-vis the competition and better target expectations customers have, depending on the market.\n\n- Online surveys made by Stellantis to the customers after purchasing the vehicle and after each contact with the after-sales service. In 2022, 6.6 million customers, of which 1.4 million for sales surveys and 5 million for aftersales surveys, responded in 65 countries worldwide. This system gives customers complete freedom, they can answer questions at the most convenient time for them and freely formulate their answers. The concerned dealer is alerted in real time on any dissatisfaction and is due to react in less than 48 hours.\nThese surveys are supported by online customer experience platforms, which allow each point of sale to challenge itself in relation to country, region and zone results. These platforms make it even more simple and easy to use verbatim results from surveys, and allow the monitoring of individual customer satisfaction. In addition to aggregating data for trend analysis, these platforms allow the network to receive and respond to customer feedback in real time. Staff can be alerted to new comments through a mobile app, allowing them to immediately contact an individual customer, if needed.\n\nA plan is underway to converge the platforms within each region, monitor the major contact points of the customer journey, integrate social media such as Google or Advisor to obtain a global vision of the customer experience in each brand and strengthen action synergies.\n\nCustomer Care\n\nThere are dedicated customer care organizations in all regions to manage customer engagement activities worldwide. Customer Care is the primary point of communication between customers and the Company; it provides support through a variety of channels including telephone, chat, email, online and from the vehicle. Stellantis operates 47 contact centers worldwide, with approximately 2,520 agents and supervisors. Customer Care handles more than 6.9 million of inbound contacts per year, offering a variety of services including requests for information, complaint management, roadside assistance, and sales leads. The contact centers provide multilingual support with a strong focus on employing native speakers of 19 languages.\n\nStellantis believes that skilled, knowledgeable, and motivated agents are essential for a high level of customer satisfaction. For this reason, in 2022, more than 48,500 hours of training have been delivered to agents and team leaders on new products, customer handling behaviors, processes, systems and new procedures.\n\nIn 2022, Stellantis set the following priorities:\n\n- Roll-out of a global, consistent methodology to measure customer satisfaction along with a strong regional governance model to review performance and ensure continuous improvement; share best practices between regions on a weekly basis.\n- Enhance agent training and customer handling skills to reduce the level of effort for the customer.\n- Ensure sustainable operational performance throughout the customer journey from initial contact to timely resolution of requests.\n- Provide a \u201cVoice of the Customer\u201d to relevant Stellantis internal stakeholders to identify emerging issues and improve processes that impact the customer. Work to develop an automated solution for 2023 and beyond, to provide all Stellantis departments easy access to the Customer\u2019s voice.\n- Develop a unique, tailored solution for both measuring and better understanding of the customers\u2019 needs and challenges, to make our customers\u2019 journey with Stellantis a pleasant adventure.\nAMAZON AND STELLANTIS COLLABORATION FOR CUSTOMER-CENTRIC CONNECTED EXPERIENCES\n\n\u201cWe will transform our vehicles into personalized living spaces and enhance the overall customer experience\u201d, declared CEO of Stellantis C. Tavares.\n\nTogether, the two companies are creating a suite of software-based products and services that seamlessly integrate with customers\u2019 digital lives and add value over time through regular over-the-air (OTA) software updates:\n\n- Amazon and Stellantis are collaborating to deliver software solutions for new digital cabin platform, STLA SmartCockpit, starting in 2024\n- Stellantis selects Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its preferred cloud provider for vehicle platforms to deliver on its long-term, software-focused vision\n- AWS and Stellantis will launch collaborative engineering and innovation initiatives and tools to accelerate time to market for new digital products and upskill Stellantis\u2019 global workforce\n- Amazon will be the first commercial customer for the new Ram ProMaster Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) in 2023, further expanding Amazon\u2019s sustainable delivery network.\n\n4.2.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\n4.2.7.1 Innovation Initiatives\n\nStellantis owned retail develops its used vehicle e-commerce solution: a 100% digital and personalized customer journey\n\nWith SelliWay, a module integrated with the used vehicle bee2link expert tool, Stellantis Owned Retail has a solution that enables 100% of the sale of used vehicles online, from vehicle trade-in to e-payment and delivery. This model aims to meet the expectations of used vehicle customers in terms of speed, fluidity, and transparency.\n\nFrom the first contact with the online sales agent, the customer is guided step-by-step through all key stages of the purchase process, appraisal and online rating when there is a vehicle trade-in, real-time presentation of the used vehicle in the Spoticar national inventory matched to the customer\u2019s choice, visualization of the chosen vehicle, online offer and secure payment.\n\nThe addition of video, live chat and e-signature make the journey simple and convenient for the customer. During the proof of concept from December 2020 to April 2021 in Belgium, 10% of total used vehicle sales were made through this channel, without in person customer contact.\nThe deployment of the tool is planned for all European subsidiaries of Stellantis Owned Retail.\n\nIn 2021, the system was launched in Belgium, Spain, France and Portugal. In 2023, Italy, Germany and Austria will be deployed.\n\nThus, all used vehicles proposed for sale on the Stellantis & You sites, whatever the brand, can be sold remotely with the SelliWay tool.\n\n**Launch of an e-commerce program**\n\nAs announced in the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, Stellantis has launched, in 2021, an outstanding 360\u00b0 e-commerce program to let our customers discover and buy products and services of the group, in a full customer centric digital ecosystem aimed to answer prospects & customers omnichannel aspirations. Thanks to this program, customers can access personalized services and offers in a seamless way, and buy them easily, both from home and in our stores.\n\nIn 2021, we sold 100,000 units online. Now we are taking the lessons learned, and plan to expand our online sales, doubling each year until 2024, reaching 800,000 vehicles. And by 2030, one-third of our sales will come from online customers.\n\nIn 2022, we sold 208,000 units, in line with our objectives.\n\n**All of Stellantis in just one click thanks to the Marketplace**\n\nAs a customer-centric company, Stellantis implements its Marketplace, a services ecosystem that provides owner and user-based solutions with a full catalogue of meaningful services including financial solutions, insurance options, full vehicle care options, accessory and personalization options, electrification services, connected services, mobility solutions and more.\n\nThis ecosystem will be available via the web, mobile phone app, and in vehicle, giving customers an easy one-click access to robust personalized solutions. Marketplace will allow Stellantis to lead the mobility market in three ways:\n\n- streamline all individual touchpoints into a one-click solution thereby eliminating pain points associated with shopping for individual components separately;\n- provide competitive quality services to enable our customers to feel confident with our solutions;\n- use our insights to personalize the journey, ensuring relevance and simplicity.\n\nAs announced in the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, the implementation started in 2022 in both Italy and the U.S. with twice more than in 2021\n\nUnits sold online\n\n208,000\n\ntwice more than in 2021\nspecific brands from the legacy organizations. In 2023, these pilots will expand to all brands and to GS countries in Europe plus the U.S. By 2024, Marketplace will be expanded to all countries of Europe and will commence in Latin America. The goal is to have this approach launched in all regions and across all customer categories by 2027. This will be a new channel for the entire business and is expected to contribute up to \u20ac4 billion in services revenue in the future.\n\n**Innovation in manufacturing quality**\n\nAs part of a continuous improvement approach to the quality of its products, an innovation based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has made it possible to automate various control stations throughout the production line vehicle and mechanical component factories. The first control station was installed in the Sochaux factory, in France, at the end of 2020 and has proven the efficiency of the process. Stellantis has invested several millions of euros in 2021 and 2022 in the implementation of 52 control stations in its various factories of which 48 are fully operational. The target is to install such stations in more regions in the coming years.\n\n**Product predictive maintenance**\n\nStellantis is piloting a new Predictive Maintenance service on its vehicles to more quickly identify the root cause of complex failures, and to anticipate failures which can require towing. Complex failures can sometimes be difficult to analyze and require lengthy investigations which can immobilize a customer\u2019s vehicle.\n\nIn 2020, analytical methods using Data Science models were implemented to help a dealership better understand complex breakdowns and replace the right parts. This experimental phase has shown a positive impact on failures with unknown origins, and on failures which needed intervention by technicians at the dealership.\n\nNext step is to use these Data Science methods before the dealership intervention, and try to anticipate the breakdowns, eliminating the need to collect real-time data from our customers\u2019 existing onboard Controller Area Network (CAN) sensor data. The term \u201cCAN\u201d designates a robust vehicle bus standard designed to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other\u2019s applications without a host computer.\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, predictive algorithms were developed on several parts of the vehicle, such as powertrain and chassis. These algorithms, based on AI methods, were developed with real-time data, and can provide advanced alerts on specific breakdown typologies. Due to their good performances, stability, and financial efficiency, some are currently in a pilot phase for a planned industrialization in 2023, first for Europe then worldwide.\n4.2.7.2 Achievements\n\nAt Stellantis, we measure Product and Services Quality through several surveys, KPIs and external sources to be sure multiple aspects of the customer experience are monitored and evaluated. The syndicated surveys are very important to measure our improvement as they allow us to see our relative position compared to competitors.\n\nAchievements in Quality of Products\n\n- Product satisfaction is measured as the percentage of models in the first quartile of their competitive segment.\n\n  Surveys show that customers are more and more satisfied with the Stellantis models. The percentage of Stellantis models ranked in the first quartile of their competitive segment about satisfaction with the product is increasing year by year:\n  - 24% for vehicles sold in Model Year 2018;\n  - 31% for vehicles sold in Model Year 2020;\n  - 40.5% for vehicles sold in Model Year 2021.\n\n  The scope of the surveys is:\n  - all brands in U.S., Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, China, Japan, India, South Korea and Turkey;\n  - questionnaires are sent to customers after approximately three to four months of ownership.\n\n  These are some examples of Stellantis brands ranking according to this product satisfaction measurement provided by syndicated surveys:\n  - U.S., two of our five brands are in the Top3, among 17 mainstream brands;\n  - Brazil and Argentina, one of our four brands reached a Top3 ranking in both countries, among 12 brands in Brazil and nine in Argentina;\n  - China, one of our four brands is ranked in Top3, among 21 mainstream brands;\n  - Europe:\n    - one of our five brands within the mainstream market is in the first quartile, among 19 mainstream brands;\n    - in the premium market, two of our four brands are in the Top3, among 15 premium brands.\n\n- In addition, with the same surveys, an initial quality is measured during the first three or four months of ownership, by the number of Problems experienced Per one Hundred vehicles (PPH). The lower the PPH score, the higher the vehicle quality.\nThese are some examples of ranking according to this measurement:\n\n- **vehicle mainstream segmentation:**\n  - Europe, in some countries, the number of our brands ranked in Top3 increased from two in 2020 to four in 2022, among 19 brands;\n  - U.S.: One of our brands reached a Top3 position, among 17 brands;\n\n- **premium segment:**\n  - Europe, one of our brands is ranked in the first quartile, among 15 premium brands.\n\nWe also track the three-months product repair rate versus reference year (in base 100).\n\nThe quality of Stellantis Low Emission Vehicles (LEVs) has improved significantly. Since 2018, the failure rate of our LEVs has decreased by 70%, thus converging to the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles quality level. That is shown on the graph.\n\n**Worldwide All Stellantis Brands vehicles failure rate - 3 Months In Service**\nStellantis plants are certified to widely accepted product quality standards to provide customers an external recognition on our ability to deliver products with a high level of quality.

It is governed by laws and regulations and may also be addressed through voluntary codes of practice, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Governmental agencies and departments such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the U.S., Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) in Japan, Federal Bureau of Motor Vehicles - Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA) in Germany, Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) in the UK, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) in South Korea are also introducing increasingly stringent vehicle safety measures.\n\nStellantis understands that safety is one of the most important expectations in society and impacts customer choices. We integrate such expectations in each phase of the design of our vehicles. We work to anticipate enhanced safety expectations related to connected and autonomous vehicles. In collaboration with our suppliers and partners, we research and develop technology and innovations while analyzing internal test results with a target of continuously improving design.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nAs the vehicle safety and regulatory framework evolves, a holistic approach including the vehicle, the road infrastructure and the vehicle environment is necessary. The Company is committed to the safety of its customers and other road users. Stellantis has taken a lead role in the framework of ISO and actively participates with recognized organizations in the rulemaking process and implementation of new regulations and standards regarding vehicle safety.\n\nThe company develops harmonized safety assessment processes to include risk-based criteria in its decisions.\n4.3.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\nCommitment scoreboard\n\n| CSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE | VISION/AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | RESULTS |\n|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|---------|\n| Vehicle safety      | Develop and offer safe products all around the world, continuously striving for state-of-the-art level of safety risk avoidance, as well as crash protection for vehicle occupants and vulnerable road users | Level of robustness of the global harmonized vehicle safety organization, processes and technical expertise, including active safety, passive safety, cybersecurity (for its safety relevance), and product safety | Short-term: 2025: Governance, organization and processes defined and set up, external audit every 3 years, performed by an independent assessment body and considering industry standards including ISO26262, ISO21448, ISO21434 | 2022: The Global Safety Forum is meeting quarterly to define the safety guidelines for Stellantis.

Vehicle safety is designed to address the risks that may be encountered and is essential to support the reputation of the Company, its brands and technologies. Anticipating regulation changes and participating in the rule making process and standardization efforts provide opportunities to adapt our vehicles and shape the automotive industry.\n\nVehicle safety is included as part of our culture to increase vehicle quality by empowering employees, contractors, suppliers and dealers to speak up if they have concerns. When risks are addressed, and opportunities to add content that achieve improved safety ratings are deployed, safer vehicles are the result. Safer vehicles can increase customer and stakeholder trust. Stellantis confirms its commitment to vehicle safety and supports an integrated approach including a sound impact assessment to identify the most effective measures.\n\nStellantis faces risks related to vehicle safety issues, which could lead to product recalls and warranty obligations that may result in direct costs and loss of vehicle sales with possible material adverse effects on our business.\nProduct recalls may also harm our reputation, force us to halt the sale of certain vehicles and cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products. The Company periodically initiates voluntary recall actions to address safety issues related to vehicles sold. Recall costs substantially depend on the nature of the remedy and the number of vehicles affected and may arise many years after a vehicle\u2019s sale.\n\nStellantis also addresses the emerging cybersecurity risks resulting from the increased connectivity and software contents in its vehicles through dedicated processes and resources.\n\n4.3.3.2 Opportunities\n\nWe leverage innovation to reinforce the safety of our vehicles and services. All aspects of safety; including active, passive, product and cyber are addressed in our processes and Innovations.\n\nStellantis is contributing to the definition of vehicle safety through several channels:\n\n- Strong commitment of safety-related standardization activities (e.g. Cybersecurity, Functional Safety and Safety of the Intended Functionality, relevant for autonomous driving and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)).\n- Involvement in innovation initiatives and consortiums include:\n  - research activities on \u201cVehicle to X\u201d and 5G technologies, which may help make the vehicles of the future more intelligent and comfortable for users.

This forum guides the Company on the application of future standards and ratifies future processes and procedures concerning vehicle safety and security. We are growing our Transversal Safety Expertise Networks to further develop and improve our safety processes and assess their implementation in our vehicles. At a regional level, decision making processes are in place to address potential vehicle safety issues.\n\n4.3.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nDelivering safe products to our customers is a fundamental objective of Stellantis and is among the essential responsibilities described in our Code of Conduct. We work to achieve compliance with regulatory standards to deliver quality products and services with a high level of safety and reliability for all road participants, including professional drivers. Employees are expected to comply with the implemented safety standards, taking appropriate steps to prevent, identify and correct any non-compliance with such standards. Any vehicle safety issue encountered must be immediately reported to supervisors, the Compliance or Legal Departments or through the Whistleblowing Policy Integrity Helpline.\n\n4.3.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nSafety research\n\nThe Stellantis advanced engineering organizations around the world apply virtual reality methods and innovative technological solutions for virtual and physical tests. The engineers also analyze real world data to develop and assess effective vehicle safety systems, protection for vulnerable road users and integration of active and passive safety systems.\n\nStellantis participates in national and international organizations that are focused on areas of occupant and vulnerable road user safety, such as assisting in the development of new and improved safety standards and automated driving system best practices. We are a member of the Initiative for the Global Harmonization of Accident Data (IGLAD), a consortium of auto manufacturers that collects and analyzes traffic accident data to improve road and vehicle safety and has supported the EU project MeBeSafe. In Europe, the Company is a stakeholder of the LAB, a joint laboratory with the Renault Group, which is working on accident case studies, bio-mechanics and driver behavior. In the U.S., the Company collaborates with other automakers through groups like the U.S. Council for Automotive Research (USCAR), to identify technical issues and conduct research related to vehicle safety.\nProduct development\n\nFor every Stellantis vehicle project, safety experts perform technical assessments throughout the project and those results are summarized and communicated to the Product Development Department\u2019s top management for review and approval to continue. An harmonized process is currently being incorporated and will be utilized on all future Stellantis vehicle projects. The network of appointed safety experts define, apply, monitor and improve safety practices in Stellantis, and contribute to the definition of international standards.\n\nStellantis recently invested \u20ac33 million in its testing hubs to address the validation needs of its new technologies, including safety features.\n\nProduct investigation\n\nStellantis has a dedicated team to investigate field issues including those with potential safety consequences. Investigations are launched to determine potential consequences and corresponding safety and non-compliance risks and countermeasures e.g., field actions and product safety recalls. The investigation team coordinates the responses to the identified incidents with the engineering, manufacturing, and customer care organizations, and external suppliers. The procedures include opportunities for early detection, crisis management and immediate action. The safety expert network can contribute to this process for the root cause analysis and risk assessment.\n\nIn addition, dedicated regional decision-making bodies called Vehicle Regulations Committees (VRC) meet regularly to systematically analyze the potentially safety-relevant anomalies detected in production or in the field. The VRC determine the proper course of action, e.g. safety recalls, under the chairmanship of the Technical Safety and Regulatory Compliance Officer, who is in the Planning organization but operates as an independent authority on safety.\n\nCybersecurity\n\nSecuring customer data and our vehicles from cybersecurity threats is a priority for Stellantis. We have a cross-functional team focused on the security of our corporate systems and vehicles by monitoring threats, clearly defining requirements followed by design and implementation reviews, validation and penetration testing of products and services and incident response. Cybersecurity is considered throughout a vehicle\u2019s life cycle including during development, manufacturing, use, service and disposal.\nThe processes to manage the Cybersecurity-by-design concept are based on specific activities linked to the Stellantis organization and technical solutions:\n\n- **Onboard** with one Electronic Architecture, by using standard cryptographic mechanisms to protect and to isolate the Connected domain to the Safety domain, as powertrain and chassis.\n- **Off-Board** platform with a complete informatics infrastructure to interconnect Servers, Applications, and Interfaces to guaranty the end-to-end the communication with vehicles associated to high level of security.\n- **Manufacturing** environment to configure the vehicles in the assembly line, by using tools connected to the backend to recover the good configuration for each vehicle produced.\n- **After-Sales** to diagnose and to maintain vehicles, by using dedicated tools connected to one specific maintenance server with strong authentication.\n- **Crisis Management** organization and processes to manage the mitigation plan, considering the incidents, attacks or vulnerabilities discovered during the vehicle live cycle.\nThe Stellantis processes on Cybersecurity concern all divisions involved in connected vehicles, from the design until the decommissioning. Specific end-to-end cybersecurity assessment is established for all new design, on embedded electronic components (Infotainment, Telematics, Gateway) and in off-board ICT platform for connected vehicles.\n\nThe global Stellantis organization for the product considers the entire activities in each division involved: Engineering, Manufacturing, After-Sales, Information & Communication and Quality division for Incident response and crisis management.\n\nOne dedicated Cyber Governance for the product manages all field issues on Safety, Privacy, Operational and Financial.\n\nWe are engaged in the development of international industry standards through participation with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and SAE International committees and in the development of best practice guidelines through participation in the Automotive-Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Auto-ISAC). Auto-ISAC enhances the industry\u2019s ability to quickly learn of new threats and vulnerabilities and to work collaboratively on threat intelligence for triage.\n\nIn 2022, in compliance with UNECE regulation (RU155) incorporated into GSR v2 2019/2144, Stellantis has received certifications on its Cyber Security Management System (CSMS), covering methodologies and processes needed to address cybersecurity in its products and services.\n\nThe objective for 2023 is to pass cybersecurity type approval for six electronic architectures, in compliance with UNECE regulation (RU155).\n\n4.3.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nAs explained in our Code of Conduct, our workforce members contribute to achieving compliance with regulatory standards ensuring that the Company delivers quality products and services with a high level of safety, reliability and environmental performance.\n\nVehicle Safety Technology\n\nStellantis responds to consumer expectations of high tech solutions in their vehicles by devoting significant resources to research and develop technologies that support drivers and passengers' ability to safely interact with their vehicle and with the world around them. By providing real-time availability of services and information, the Company is contributing to improve safety and the mobility experience.\n\nStellantis offers active (primary) and passive (secondary) features for diverse drivers and vehicle segments, along with tertiary safety elements. The intent of active safety systems is to help drivers avoid crashes by alerting them to certain potentially hazardous situations or assisting them in mitigating the risk posed by certain types of identified hazards. These systems monitor surroundings, the status of the vehicle, driver behavior and include semi-automated technologies that provide assistance to drivers in certain instances, with the driver retaining appropriate control. Stellantis is exploring\nnew connected safety notification technologies, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) and Safety Cloud, that provide drivers advanced notification warnings of potential hazards in their path.\n\nPassive or secondary safety systems are designed to help mitigate the effects of a crash. These include occupant restraint technology and the use of more advanced materials that enable us to improve crash energy management. Vehicles are structurally designed to dissipate an impact in a controlled manner, due to the positioning of shock absorbing structures and other design features, while also promoting vehicle repairability. Deformation of the passenger compartment is minimized. Airbags and restraint systems absorb energy which leads to a reduction of the impact on occupants in crashes.\n\nIn the area of tertiary safety, or post-accident emergency response, Stellantis provides emergency rescue sheets with information to rescue teams or first responders on special design elements and the position of components to be considered when assisting the occupants of vehicles involved in an accident. In addition, connectivity functions provide assistance when an accident or health related incident occurs in the vehicle. The occupants are connected with a dedicated assistance center that pinpoints the vehicle. For instance, motorway control centers in Europe are automatically warned of any accidents on their roads via the emergency call service in the Company\u2019s equipped vehicles as this is becoming a legal obligation in Europe.\n\nCOMPANY TRANSFORMATION THROUGH THE SOFTWARE STRATEGY\n\nStellantis mapped out its software strategy to deploy next-generation tech platforms, building on existing connected vehicle capabilities to transform how customers interact with their vehicles. Over-the-air (OTA) updates expand the options customers have to add innovative features and services keeping vehicles updated with the latest offerings years after they have been built, while dramatically reducing costs for both customers and Stellantis.\n\nOwners of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Fiat and Alfa Romeo vehicles will receive a free over-the-air software update called the Emergency Vehicle Alert System or EVAS, which was introduced at the 2022 CES electronics show in Las Vegas. Stellantis is the first automaker to implement its EVAS to 2018-and-newer Stellantis cars, trucks and SUVs. Initially available only in North America, it could be offered eventually in all 14 Stellantis brands worldwide.\n\nThe new system warns drivers of nearby emergency vehicles, making it possible to provide more time to react. OTA alerts are sent from emergency vehicles to nearby drivers as well as other responding emergency vehicles within approximately a half-mile. Real time data is used from emergency vehicles using the HAAS company\u2019s service called Safety Cloud. This gives drivers an additional warning and more time to move over and slow down compared to conventional lights and sirens alone.\n\nFor more information\nhttps://www.thedetroitbureau.com/2022/01/stellantis-first-to-offer-emergency-vehicle-alert-system/#:~:text=Stellantis%20is%20the%20first%20automaker,which%20costs%20$12.99%20a%20month\nACTIVE SAFETY SYSTEMS\n\nEXAMPLES OF ACTIVE SAFETY SYSTEMS\n\n- Constantly monitor the performance and surrounding of a vehicle\n- Can prevent accidents from happening altogether or actively help the driver to reduce the impact\n- Avoid or mitigate an accident pre-impact, so before it happens\n\nEXAMPLES OF ACTIVE SYSTEMS THAT GIVE THE DRIVER MORE CONTROL IN DANGEROUS SITUATIONS\n\n- Anti-lock braking (ABS)\n- Electronic stability control (ESC) Automatic\n- Autonomous emergency braking (AEB)\n- Lane Keeping Assist\n\nThis figure presents some of the active safety system that can support the driver, by sensing the vehicle environment, informing the driver and/or acting as needed on the vehicle dynamics.\n\nSafety Roadmap\n\nStellantis continuously evolves its vehicles by offering enhanced safety technology and state of the art features that are proven to help reduce crashes and injuries. All Stellantis vehicles are rigorously tested and validated internally before being tested by outside stakeholders such as the U.S. government (NHTSA) or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) or NCAP organizations. In 2022, Stellantis performed about 680,000 validations, either by physical testing or virtual validation (versus 400,000 in 2021).\nTo address the current traffic safety priorities globally, Stellantis vehicles are developed with technologies such as:\n\n| Technology                                      | 2022 | 2021 |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Lane Keeping Assist                             | 75%  | 57%  |\n| Automatic Emergency Braking                     | 68%  | 63%  |\n| Rear seats seatbelts with pretensioner or load limiter | 69%  | 66%  |\n| Speed limiting device                           | 75%  | 69%  |\n\nStellantis also conducts research and innovation activities in the field of crash and occupant safety. The frontal roof airbag is an example of innovation that offers improved protection to the front passenger occupant in certain crash situations.\n\n**Product Investigations and Recall campaigns**\n\nWhen potential vehicle safety issues arise, we promptly investigate and take corrective action as previously stated. This includes initiating safety recall campaigns when appropriate. Stellantis aims to improve the overall customer experience during the safety recall process through timely and accurate communication and reduced customer inconvenience. In 2022, there were 139 recall campaigns involving 14,708,345 initial recall notices concerning vehicles produced over several years worldwide (versus versus 124 recall campaigns involving 3,003,480 in 2021). Programs are in place to raise public awareness regarding the need for customers to regularly check for open recalls and the importance of getting recall repairs completed.\n\nThe operations carried out are free of charge for the customer.\n\nThe three largest recall campaigns by total number of vehicles are:\n\n- campaign on approximately 8.7 million vehicles to extend the Takata non-dessicated inflator campaign across all STLA regions;\n- campaign on approximately 1.4 million vehicles to prevent possible inadvertent tailgate opening on certain RAM trucks;\n- campaign on approximately 0.4 million vehicles to solve an issue that could prevent the ESC telltale from being illuminated when necessary.\n\nAll 2022 recall campaigns were voluntary.\nAll of these campaigns are carried out transparently with respect to:\n\n- the relevant requirements of authorities (regulatory filing of declarations for safety campaigns):\n  - each notification document submitted to the authorities indicates: the models and parts concerned, vehicle manufacture dates, type of risk, description of the defect and corrective measures taken;\n\n- the automotive brands\u2019 dealership networks:\n  - the traceability of the components purchased during manufacturing enables the Company to draw up a list of vehicles that are potentially concerned. When a campaign is launched an alert including all the information, such as a list of vehicles concerned, content of the message to customers, necessary procedure and parts required is sent to the dealership networks via the appropriate IT systems;\n\n- the owners of the vehicles involved notified individually:\n  - the method used to notify the customer is in line with the local regulations in each country. The affected customers are invited to make an appointment with an authorized brand repair facility to make the necessary adjustments;\n  - the repair facility contacted provides all the necessary information, including the appointment date, how long the repair will take, the confirmation that the repairs are free of charge, the terms for using a replacement vehicle, etc.;\n  - the customer is asked to notify the brand of any change in vehicle status, including its sale, end-of-life or change of address.\n\nStellantis monitors the implementation of each campaign specifically based on progress indicators and the actual repairs made in each campaign. Repeat requests are sent to customers who do not come forward.\n\n**Theft Resistance**\n\nStellantis has long been working on making vehicles resistant to theft and protecting vehicles and the objects inside them from malicious individuals. Vehicles are designed to help avoid break-ins referring to standards in line with leading authorities and taking into account current threats.\n\nSince 2011, a unit has been analyzing and addressing potential or known vulnerabilities, conducting statistical and Internet monitoring, and analyzing theft methods in conjunction with the police. This work has, for example, spurred alterations to the design of door locks to strengthen their resistance to break-ins.\n\nWe work closely with cybersecurity experts and are assisted by specialized firms. For instance, encryption algorithms used to protect vehicle unlocking and starting are continually improved. The latest generation vehicles use encryption that meets the highest standards.\nTraining\n\nProduct safety-based training materials are captured in two courses; Introduction to U.S. Motor Vehicle Safety and Safety Defect Determination. Due to legislative and regulatory changes the U.S. Motor Vehicle Safety course has been launched for Stellantis employees in April 2022. These web-based courses are open as a reference to all former FCA global employees but they are a mandatory requirement for specific organizations in North America.\n\nTraining sessions on harmonized Stellantis safety processes have begun in 2022.\n\nOur suppliers in North America have access to a web-based training program that helps them understand expectations and supplier-specific requirements of the U.S. Motor Vehicle Safety Act and regulations of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). This training was launched in 2017 and incorporated feedback from NHTSA. Building upon this work, a collaboration with the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG) and other automakers standardized this training and made it available throughout the automotive industry.\n5 PREVENTING ETHICS VIOLATIONS BY PROMOTING OUR ETHICAL CULTURE\n\n5.1 ETHICS IN GOVERNANCE AND BUSINESS PRACTICES\n\n5.1.1 Context and Stellantis position\n5.1.2 Forward-looking vision and targets\n5.1.3 Identification and management of risks and opportunities\n5.1.4 Governance and decision bodies to lead actions\n5.1.5 Policies for ethics in our business\n5.1.6 Allocated resources to Achieve Our Ethical Objectives\n5.1.7 Initiatives and Achievements in the pursuit of Ethical Excellence\n5.1.8 Detailed key performance indicators\n\n5.2 RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION\n\n5.2.1 Context and Stellantis position\n5.2.2 Forward-looking vision and targets\n5.2.3 Identification and management of risks and opportunities\n5.2.4 Governance and decision bodies to lead actions\n5.2.5 Policies to execute the strategy\n5.2.6 Organization and resources\n5.2.7 Main initiatives, achievements and results\n\n5.3 RESPONSIBLE INFORMATION TO CUSTOMER\n\n5.3.1 Context and Stellantis position\n5.3.2 Forward-looking vision and targets\n5.3.3 Identification and management of risks and opportunities\n5.3.4 Governance and decision bodies to lead actions\n5.3.5 Policies to execute the strategy\n5.3.6 Organization and resources\n5.3.7 Main initiatives, achievements and results\nSTEMLANTIS\u2019 CSR MACRO-RISK/PILLAR IV.

This approach not only looks at our internal processes and controls, but also at our compliance with complex national and international regulations and standards that promote transparency. Our Governance, Code of Conduct and various charters are available on our website for public review. Our approach relies on developing a culture of transparency and integrity throughout the Company through the effective deployment of balanced governance, a compliance program that is subject to appropriate outside benchmarking and effective mechanisms that allow our workforce to alert us of any noncompliance concerns.\n5.1.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\nCommitment scoreboard\n\n| CSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE | VISION/AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | RESULTS |\n|----------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|---------|\n| Ethics in governance and business practices | Promote a culture of transparency and integrity by requiring our workforce to comply with our Code of Conduct, applying appropriate discipline for non-compliance, and requiring our business partners to adopt and apply similar ethical standards and controls | Number of days to provide a personalized first answer on reported concerns regarding potential violations of the Code of Conduct | Short-term: 2025: Personalized first answer within 1.5 days | 2022: 1.3 days |\n| | | | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan): 2030: Personalized first answer within 1.25 days | 2021: 1.9 days |\n| | | | Long-term: 2050: Personalized first answer within 1 day | |\n| | World Most Ethical (WME) Company status with Ethisphere* | 2025: Obtain recognition by Ethisphere as one of the World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies as part of their WME process | Satisfactory progress towards objective | |\n| | | 2030: Maintain WME status by Ethisphere | | |\n| | | 2050: Maintain WME status by Ethisphere | | |\n| | Board gender balance (% of female directors) | 2025: at least 40% of Board seats should be occupied by women and 40% by men upon expiration of current terms | 27% - Currently we have 3 female directors | |\n| | | 2030: at least 40% of Board seats should be occupied by women and 40% by men upon expiration of current terms | 27% - Currently we have 3 female directors | |\n| | | 2050: at least 40% of Board seats should be occupied by women and 40% by men upon expiration of current terms | 27% - Currently we have 3 female directors | |\n\n* The Ethisphere WME process is described here [https://ethisphere.com/what-we-do/worlds-most-ethical-companies](https://ethisphere.com/what-we-do/worlds-most-ethical-companies)\n\n5.1.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nThe Chief Audit and Compliance Officer periodically conducts a Compliance Risk Assessment to ensure that the Ethics and Compliance Program identifies compliance risks, takes proper steps to mitigate such risks, and does so in an efficient manner. The identification of compliance risks includes communication and collaboration with the ERM and Audit functions, as well as the integration of information from various relevant sources, including the Integrity Helpline channel. Mitigation steps include training, communication, third party management, and disciplinary enforcement for violations of the Code of Conduct. Every functional element of the program is subject to analysis for continuous improvement, benchmarking, and audit. Opportunities for improvement are compiled and periodically reviewed by the Ethics and Compliance Committee.\nIn line with directives from the Ethics and Compliance Committee, the Chief Audit and Compliance Officer devotes special focus to the following areas of the law with the understanding that in each case, any violation of these areas of the law would be contrary to our ethical principles, and would also subject the Company to potential penalties, reputational damage and litigation:\n\n### RISK #1 COMPETITION\n\n**Risk Description**\n\nCompetition in the marketplace is a subject of significant scrutiny by relevant authorities all over the world. Penalties for infractions to fair competition laws are serious, are often for significant monetary amounts and tend to generate private litigation.\n\n**Achievements/Opportunities**\n\nWe believe in robust and fair competition in the marketplace, and strongly support the benefits it provides to our customers. Competition also promotes innovation. We work to strictly follow the competition laws that apply to our business all over the world to prevent anticompetitive and unfair trade practices such as market-sharing, price-fixing, information sharing and dumping. An antitrust policy has been released for all employees. Also a compliance monitoring system for participation in professional associations meetings will be put in place on a pilot basis in Enlarged Europe, for its subsequent deployment globally, in order to prevent, detect and manage antitrust risks and compliance activities.\n\n### RISK #2 RESPONSIBLE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS\n\n**Risk Description**\n\nWe understand that the success of our business depends on our ability to interact effectively with governments, customers, suppliers and civil society at large. Failure to manage the relationships properly and effectively can undermine goodwill in the communities where we do business and place in jeopardy, the success of our business.\n\n**Achievements/Opportunities**\n\nBased on the experiences of its predecessor entities, Stellantis works diligently to increase transparency in all dealings with its stakeholders, including unionized labor, suppliers, business partners and NGOs.\n\n### RISK #3 EXPORT CONTROLS AND SANCTIONS\n\n**Risk Description**\n\nExport controls reflect the decisions of governments regarding national security and economic policy. Failure to abide with such controls could result in enforcement actions or legal proceedings that would jeopardize our cross border operations, causing a substantial negative effect.\n\n**Achievements/Opportunities**\n\nOur specialists around the world classify our products with an intention to ensure compliance with regulations that restrict trade. Our team also ensures that we are in compliance with economic sanctions that restrict or prohibit trade in certain countries or with designated companies or individuals. In 2022, in response to the Russia/Ukraine crisis, we enhanced our ability to detect sanctioned entities or persons by tools that will alert us not only of any restricted individual or entity in our supply chain, but also of any entity that is majority-owned by such restricted individual or entity.\n### RISK #4 LOBBYING AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS\n\n**Risk Description**\nOur interactions with governments allow legislative bodies to develop regulations and standards that are responsive to the needs of our customers, communities and other stakeholders. Failure to apply proper controls in the manner in which we manage these interactions would place Stellantis at risk for a violation of laws regarding political contributions or corruption. Also, failure to engage would risk the perspectives and expertise of Stellantis not being included in the creation and amendment of legislation, regulations and governmental policy.\n\n**Achievements/Opportunities**\nThe Public Affairs Department is dedicated and trained to ensure an efficient and fair working relationship with governments, in full compliance with the law and corporate policies regarding anti-corruption. We impose controls to implement the Stellantis policy that no Company funds or assets may be used for contributions to any political party or candidate. In 2022, we kept legislative bodies apprised of strategic issues affecting the automotive industry, such as the shift to electric vehicles.\n\n### RISK #5 DATA PROTECTION\n\n**Risk Description**\nPrivacy is a fundamental right that is protected by law in the multiple jurisdictions where we do business. A company\u2019s failure to protect the privacy of its stakeholders can be heavily penalized in fines, private litigation and reputational damage.\n\n**Achievements/Opportunities**\nStellantis considers the personal rights and privacy of each individual to be fundamental and intends to protect them. Stellantis works to comply with privacy requirements by applying to Company processes, the principles relating to the processing of personal data such as lawfulness, correctness, transparency, data minimization, conservation and purpose limitation, integrity and confidentiality.\n\n### RISK #6 ANTI-CORRUPTION\n\n**Risk Description**\nCorruption has a corrosive and detrimental impact on society. Under applicable legislation, which in a multinational company such as Stellantis, includes the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, French Law Sapin II, and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, companies that engage in corrupt activities are heavily penalized.\n\n**Achievements/Opportunities**\nStellantis is committed to taking affirmative steps to prevent any corruption in its business. These include training, large prohibitions of gifts, specific controls for relations with government officials, dedicated controls for prevention. The policies and procedures relevant to the Company\u2019s anti-corruption program apply to all its subsidiaries and joint ventures in which the Company owns greater than 50%. In 2022, the Company also harmonized due diligence controls from exPSA and exFCA into a common Stellantis system that performs due diligence on business partners that meet risk criteria for the Company.\n\n### RISK #7 TAX\n\n**Risk Description**\nFailure to comply with applicable tax rules and regulations could result in enforcement actions or legal proceedings that may result in incremental tax payments and the application of late payment interest and penalties.\n\n**Achievements/Opportunities**\nThe Company believes that taxes are key contributors to the economic and social development of the communities in which we operate and play a vital role in creating long-term value. We are committed to fulfilling our fiscal obligations by administering and paying all required taxes. We work to maintain an open, honest, transparent relationship in all dealings with tax authorities. We do not use \u201ctax haven\u201d jurisdictions for the avoidance of tax.\nRISK #8  FAIR-TRADE\n\nRisk Description  We are highly cognizant that our business model depends on operation within accepted norms of international trade. In the absence of these norms, the management of our international supply chains would become more challenging and costly, increasing the costs of our products ultimately to the consumer.\n\nAchievements/Opportunities  With operations spanning more than 130 countries, Stellantis supports the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules-based system and encourages international trade deals. Trade agreements foster innovation, growth and wider customer choices at lower prices. The Company favors the elimination of tariffs, as well as a greater convergence towards international standards and trade facilitation, to provide better market access by reducing technical barriers and customs procedures in both a proportional and coordinated manner.\n\nWhere appropriate, our compliance processes are not limited to complying with the law. For example, in addition to compliance with regulations regarding integrity in business relationships, consumer protection and personal data protection rules (GDPR), we consider other types of guidance such as OECD Guidelines, ILO conventions, UN Global Compact, and the International Monetary Fund\u2019s initiatives for distribution of value, progressive taxation, investment in human capital and development of inclusive growth.\n\n5.1.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nOur ethical culture begins in our governance bodies, their members, and their proper oversight of our business. Key aspects of Stellantis governance bodies, and their members, are described below with more detailed information available on the Company\u2019s website as well as in the Annual Report.\n\nETHICS AND COMPLIANCE GOVERNANCE\n\nGo to the Company\u2019s website\nhttps://www.stellantis.com/en\n\nAnnual report\nhttps://www.stellantis.com/content/dam/stellantis-corporate/investors/financial-reports/Stellantis-NV-20221231-Annual-Report.pdf\n5.1.4.1 The Composition of the Board of Directors\n\nStellantis has a one-tier Board of Directors that includes executive and non-executive directors. According to Dutch Law and article 20.2 of Stellantis\u2019 Articles of Association the chairperson of the Board of Directors shall be independent and have the title of Senior Independent Director. The Board of Directors is composed of eleven members: two executive members and nine non-executive members, including the Senior Independent Director. The executive members received by the Board the titles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer respectively. Six non-executive members qualify as independent for purposes of NYSE rules, Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. The Board of Directors, as a whole, is responsible for the strategy of the Company. It is the responsibility of the non-executive Directors to oversee the policies carried out by the executive Directors and the general affairs of the Company. Following their appointment, Directors participated in induction sessions designed to provide them with adequate knowledge of the sector in which the Company operates. These sessions were led by management teams and included the following topics:\n\n- auto OEM business overview with a focus on geographic presence, corporate footprint, R&D methodologies and applications\n- new product development process including solutions to reduce vehicles CO\u2082 emissions, notably through electrification, in line with the climate change challenge\n- technological challenges, including software developments driving innovation in the industry and customer experience\n- auto OEM strategy plans, new emerging players and disruptive innovation and business models.\n\nAs part of the process relating to the Board activities, in 2022 the management continued to provide regular updates on the topics treated during the induction sessions.\n\nDiversity is one of Stellantis\u2019 core values and members of the Board and its committees are selected on the basis of professional and personal qualifications, as well as diversity factors that include age, gender, expertise, work and personal background and nationality. We aim to achieve, with an overriding emphasis on merit, a Board composition with: (a) women occupying at least 40% of the seats of the Board; as soon as the resolutions taken by shareholders in the context of the merger will expire and the renewal of seven members out of eleven of the Board of Directors will become feasible (b) members whose nationality is reasonably consistent with the geographic footprint of Stellantis\u2019 business in such manner that no nationality shall account for more than 60% of the members of the Board of Directors; and (c) one or more members of the Board of Directors will be under 50 years of age on the day of their nomination.\n\nBoard Member Skills Relating to Economic, Environmental and Social Impacts\n\nThe Board comprises diversified profiles in terms of gender, work, personal background and nationality. Members of the Board of Directors are selected on the basis of professional and personal qualifications in a manner designed to ensure sufficiently diverse and complementary skills to enable these members to oversee the Company\u2019s strategy.\nThe skills of the members of the Board relate to either specific operational experiences or performance as responsible for oversight over major challenges at other corporations where the directors also serve as members of the board. The skills are summarized in the following matrix:\n\n| Name                  | Climate Change | Diversity & Human Rights | Risk Management | Cyber Security | New Business Model | Industry* | Corporate Social Responsibility | Governance | Financial and Accounting | Board Memberships |\n|-----------------------|----------------|--------------------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------------|------------|---------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------------|\n| John Elkann           | \u2713              | \u2713                        | \u2713               | \u2713              | \u2713                  | \u2713          | \u2713                               | \u2713           | \u2713                        | 3                 |\n| Carlos Tavares        | \u2713              | \u2713                        | \u2713               | \u2713              | \u2713                  | \u2713          | \u2713                               | \u2713           | \u2713                        | 1                 |\n| Robert Peugeot        | \u2713              | \u2713                        | \u2713               | \u2713              | \u2713                  | \u2713          | \u2713                               | \u2713           | \u2713                        | 4                 |\n| Henri de Castries     | \u2713              | \u2713                        | \u2713               | \u2713              | \u2713                  | \u2713          | \u2713                               | \u2713           | \u2713                        | 4                 |\n| Andrea Agnelli        | \u2713              | \u2713                        | \u2713               | \u2713              | \u2713                  | \u2713          | \u2713                               | \u2713           | \u2713                        | 4                 |\n| Fiona Clare Cicconi   | \u2713              | \u2713                        | \u2713               | \u2713              | \u2713                  | \u2713          | \u2713                               | \u2713           | \u2713                        | 0                 |\n| Nicolas Dufourcq      | \u2713              | \u2713                        | \u2713               | \u2713              | \u2713                  | \u2713          | \u2713                               | \u2713           | \u2713                        | 4                 |\n| Ann Frances Godbehere | \u2713              | \u2713                        | \u2713               | \u2713              | \u2713                  | \u2713          | \u2713                               | \u2713           | \u2713                        | 1                 |\n| Wan Ling Martello     | \u2713              | \u2713                        | \u2713               | \u2713              | \u2713                  | \u2713          | \u2713                               | \u2713           | \u2713                        | 3                 |\n| Jacques de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry | \u2713            | \u2713                        | \u2713               | \u2713              | \u2713                  | \u2713          | \u2713                               | \u2713           | \u2713                        | 0                 |\n| Kevin Scott           | \u2713              | \u2713                        | \u2713               | \u2713              | \u2713                  | \u2713          | \u2713                               | \u2713           | \u2713                        | 0                 |\n\n* Industry: the Automobiles industry is under the Consumer Discretionary sector according to GICS Level 1 sector classification.\n5.1.4.2 Compensation of Directors and Executive Managers\n\nRemuneration of the Board of Directors, for both executive and non-executive Directors, is governed by the Remuneration Policy, which was approved at the Stellantis Annual General Meeting held on April 15, 2021. It takes into account scenario analyses as well as the pay differentials within the Company, compensation levels offered in the market, and shareholder and general societal views on compensation.\n\nThe Company follows a pay for performance compensation philosophy at all levels in the organization ensuring that the compensation strategy is competitive and is structured to attract and retain key staff of the requisite quality.\n\nThe principles and rules decided on by the Board of Directors to determine the compensation and benefits granted to executive directors take into account principles of completeness, balance, consistency and measurement.\n\nThe Company periodically benchmarks its executive compensation program and the compensation offered to Directors against peer companies and monitors compensation levels and trends in the market as well as international standards regarding appropriate remuneration. For this reason, non-financial performance indicators are taken into account when formulating the Company\u2019s compensation structure.\n\nThe design of our compensation program ensures that a significant portion of each executive\u2019s overall compensation is based on the achievement of long-term performance objectives through the Company\u2019s long-term incentive plan, in the belief that placing significantly more weight on the long-term component is appropriate to align the Directors\u2019 and corporate officers\u2019 efforts with the Company\u2019s strategy, long-term interests and sustainability.\n\nThe Board of Directors is assisted by its Remuneration Committee in reviewing and approving corporate goals and annual and long-term performance objectives relative to incentive compensation of executive directors, including other members of the top management team and eligible personnel.\n\nThe 2023 annual bonus plan will include the additional ESG metric of reductions in carbon emissions principally through the growth in production and sales of electric vehicles.\n\nOther employees eligible for the incentive plans shown in the above table may receive incentive compensation based on the same CSR performance metrics but with different weighting. Individual goals may also include financial and/or non-financial performance measures.\n\n5.1.4.3 Committees supporting governance of Stellantis\n\nThe ESG Committee of the Board of Directors\n\nThe ESG Committee reviews the Company\u2019s CSR roadmap, achievements and disclosures. In addition, the ESG Committee periodically assesses the performance of individual directors and reports on this to the Board of Directors.\n\nIn 2022, the ESG Committee reviewed the updates of the Company\u2019s policies in relation to Diversity of the Board of\nDirectors, Profile for Non-Executive Directors and Bilateral contacts with shareholders and submitted the related drafts to the Board for approval.\n\nThe ESG Committee members participated in informative sessions led by management teams and designed to provide them with adequate updates in the fields of the Company transformation through the development of human capital, the global philanthropy strategy, and global, European and U.S. trends in governance.\n\nThe Stellantis Annual Report provides details of the membership, skills and work of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and its committees, together with information on the skills of each of their members, as of December 31, 2022. The Board met 6 times during 2022. The average attendance at the Board meetings as well as the Committee meetings was 100 percent.\n\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Stellantis Audit Committee is charged with assisting and advising the Board of Directors with respect to the implementation and effectiveness of the Company\u2019s ethics and compliance program, among other things. In so doing, the Audit Committee oversees and monitors the quality and completeness of the Company\u2019s compliance policies and practices with respect to applicable legal and regulatory requirements, as well as with the requirements and objectives of the Company\u2019s Code of Conduct. The Committee\u2019s review reaches the compliance program as a whole and therefore is global in nature. The Audit Committee meets with the Company\u2019s management, including finance staff, audit and compliance staff, and legal staff to discuss, among other things, any significant legal, regulatory, Code of Conduct or other compliance related matters, arising anywhere in the world, that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial statements or operations.\n\nAs stated in the related Charter, the function of the Audit Committee shall be to assist and advise the Board of Directors and act under authority delegated by the Board of Directors, with respect to among others the Company\u2019s policy on tax planning adopted by management.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors is assisted by its Remuneration Committee in reviewing and approving corporate goals and annual and long-term performance objectives relative to incentive compensation of executive directors, including other members of the top management team and eligible personnel.\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance Committee\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance Committee oversees all of Stellantis ethics and compliance policies and initiatives, sets targets, reports to the CEO and periodically reports to the Board of Directors through the Audit Committee. The Ethics and Compliance Committee is chaired by the Chief Human Resources and Transformation Officer. The other members include the General Counsel, the Chief Audit and Compliance Officer and the Chief Legal Officer. The Ethics and Compliance Committee met six times in 2022.\nThe Committee is responsible for determining the general direction of the Company\u2019s ethics and compliance policies, based on external factors (new risks, emerging stakeholder expectations, benchmarking and new legislation) as well as internal considerations (risks identified by the integrated risk assessment that considers data from executive interviews, as well as data from reported cases in the Whistleblowing Policy Integrity Helpline). The Committee is also responsible for developing tools necessary to implement the ethics and compliance policies. The Committee also reviews whistleblowing cases and elevates to the Audit Committee cases of potential significant financial impact, reputational damage, or other cases that are strategic according to elevation criteria set forth in the charter of the Ethics and Compliance Committee. In line with the global scope of the Code of Conduct and the compliance policies, the Committee\u2019s directives are usually global, unless special considerations require jurisdiction-specific attention. For example, the Committee has focused on compliance with the evolving western sanctions and export controls relating to the Russia-Ukraine conflict as a jurisdiction-specific instance of its global policy to comply with applicable laws.\n\nThe Technical Compliance Committee\n\nThe Technical Compliance Committee oversees the Technical Safety and Regulatory Compliance organization\u2019s compliance with laws and regulations relating to vehicle and product safety, emissions, and other issues of a technical nature that involve regulatory compliance. The delivery of high quality and safe products is one of our overarching objectives, and integrity drives our detection, investigation and remediation of any issue of a technical nature that may jeopardize the safety of our customers, the quality of our products, or our compliance with regulatory requirements, including but not limited to emissions regulations. In addition to technical controls, we employ our whistleblowing channel to gather information about suspected noncompliance and review specific cases within our Technical Compliance Committee, and our Always with Integrity communication campaign focuses in significant part on the importance of reporting any safety and emissions concerns.\n\nLeadership Team\n\nThe general authority to represent the Company is vested in the Board of Directors and the CEO acting individually. On certain key business matters, the CEO is supported by the key governance committees, in particular the Strategy Council, Business Review and Global Programme and Allocation Committees. These bodies are responsible for executing the decisions of the CEO and Board of Directors and the day-to-day management of the Company, primarily to the extent it relates to its operational management, including reviewing the operating performance of the businesses and collaborating on certain operational matters. The CEO and members of key governance committees are expected to have exemplary conduct that is consistent with the Code of Conduct, and from time to time lead communications campaigns that help promote the Company\u2019s culture of integrity.\n5.1.5 POLICIES FOR ETHICS IN OUR BUSINESS\n\nThe culture of integrity that begins with our governance bodies is based on values that are expressed at all levels and functions in key charter documents and appropriate policies.\n\nETHICS AND COMPLIANCE MONITORING\n\n- The Compliance Committee reviews significant activities and initiatives related to policies, awareness, training, risk assessments and risk management.\n- An assigned business/functional area manages and develops plans to address this risk. The Compliance Committee is made aware of plans and risk management.\n- The business/functional area manages these topics and reports to the Compliance Committee.\n- These topics are managed under the responsibility of the business area.\n\nNote: All areas may be included in the audit risk assessment and may be included in the audit plan.\n\n* Managed in the Technical Compliance Committee\n5.1.5.1 Code of Conduct\n\nOur core values are set forth in the Stellantis Code of Conduct. The Stellantis Code of Conduct was approved by the Board of Directors of Stellantis N.V. in March 2021. It applies to the members of the Stellantis Board of Directors, Stellantis\u2019 officers, full-time and part-time employees, temporary and contract workers. Stellantis also expects its stakeholders, including suppliers, dealers, distributors, and joint venture partners, to act with integrity and in accordance with the Code. It is the responsibility of all workforce members to report suspected or potential violations of the Code of Conduct.\n\nThe Stellantis Code of Conduct focuses on four main areas:\n\n- the protection of the Stellantis workforce, including a commitment to diversity, fairness, and health and safety, and to the United Nations declaration on human rights and the International Labor Organization\u2019s declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work\n- the way that Stellantis conducts business, engaging in sustainable practices that promote vehicle safety, quality, data privacy and environmental protection, and that comply with other applicable laws and regulations, such as anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, insider trading and others\n- the interaction of Stellantis\u2019 workforce with external parties, including the avoidance of conflicts of interest and the support of our communities\n- the protection of Stellantis\u2019 assets and information.\n\nThe principles of the Code are applicable globally, and our communications, training, and discipline aim at creating a uniform culture of integrity wherever Stellantis conducts business.\n\nAt Stellantis, we do not allow any retaliation against any person who makes a report in good faith or who cooperates in an investigation. Interested parties are allowed to report a concern confidentially and anonymously where allowed by law. Any retaliation is subject to disciplinary action.\n\nThe Stellantis Code of Conduct is available under the Governance section on the Company\u2019s website.\n\n5.1.5.2 Company\u2019s Compliance Policies\n\nStellantis policies provide further details and guidance regarding the principles established in the Code of Conduct. These include policies on Anti-corruption, Export Controls, Conflicts of Interest, and others. The policies are tailored to the business of the Company, and emphasize integrity, transparency, compliance with applicable legal or regulatory frameworks, and establish a foundation for sustainability.\n\nThe Policies are supplemented by Procedures that give detailed guidance on the implementation of the policies. By the end of 2022, approximately 30 compliance-related Policies and Procedures have been published to supplement the Code, Compliance Policies and Procedures are subject to the review and approval of the Ethics and Compliance Committee.\n5.1.5.3 The Company\u2019s Tax Policy\n\nThe Company\u2019s Tax Policy (the \u201cTax Policy\u201d) is approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and is published on the Company\u2019s website.\n\nThe Vice President of Tax is responsible for centralized coordination and management of the Tax Policy and for ensuring that the Company complies with all fiscal obligations for administering and paying all applicable taxes.\n\nThese responsibilities are achieved through a dedicated Company tax structure of Regional Heads and Sector Heads of Tax who manage all tax-related matters at the Company level and within each of the Business Operating segments and Service companies, which are clearly defined and regularly updated. The Tax Policy is approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and is implemented under the direction of the Chief Financial Officer. The Tax Policy and supporting policies have been adopted to ensure that Tax Compliance, Tax Planning and Tax Risks are effectively and consistently managed at the Regional, Sector and Company levels. The Tax Policy is guided by the primary consideration that all material tax positions taken by the Company must comply with applicable laws and regulations and with the core principles that define the Company\u2019s relationships with its main stakeholders and govern how it conducts its business activities.\n\nThe Company\u2019s policy is to pay taxes legally due in countries within the course of its industrial or commercial activities, without artificial arrangements that shift value to low-tax jurisdictions. Under the same policy, cross-border transactions are conducted on an arms-length basis in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, including OECD Guidelines where applicable. Secrecy jurisdictions or so-called \u2018tax havens\u2019 are not to be used for the avoidance of tax.\n\nThe Company\u2019s annual tax disclosures are included within the financial statements and accompanying footnotes available on the Company\u2019s website.\n\n5.1.5.4 The Company\u2019s Public Affairs policy\n\nResponsible Public Affairs Practices\n\nStellantis Public Affairs practices adhere to the UN Global Compact recommendations toward responsible contributions to public debate. Our relationship with governments is respectful, proactive and transparent. In line with Stellantis CSR commitments, the Company takes part in public debate on a wide range of issues, including those related to the automotive industry, ecology and the environment, transportation and mobility, data protection, road safety, regional development and international trade.\n\nPublic Affairs Organization We monitor applicable legislation and regulations, and we bring our expertise to the development of regulations and standards that are responsive to the needs of our customers, communities and other stakeholders.\nIn order to regulate its practices and make them clear to external contacts, Stellantis has adopted a specific charter for relations with public institutions. Furthermore, the Company has determined a specific delegation of authority applicable to Public Affairs to determine (1) how Corporate positions are defined and (2) which Professional Memberships Stellantis adheres to. The senior leaders of all regions have received a training on both documents and are responsible to inform their team accordingly. Both the charter and the delegation of authority apply to Stellantis employees who interact with public authorities (governments, parliaments, administrations, local authorities, etc.). They are to carry out their activity with probity and integrity, following the principles outlined in the charter and summarized below:\n\n- **Control of practices**: Per Stellantis delegation of authority, new positions taken on the most significant topics are approved by the CEO and debated in the Strategy Council. Moreover, Stellantis\u2019 positions on public issues are aligned with Dare Forward 2030. The Public Affairs Department is placed under the authority of the General Counsel who reports directly to the CEO. As outlined in section 2.4 related to \u201cclimate governance\u201d, all senior executives have incentive plans based on the CO2 performances of the Company, hence, the public positions taken by Stellantis are aligned with the climate change ambition of the Company. At an operational level, the managers in the Public Affairs Department are tasked with upholding the Stellantis Code of Conduct and the Charter with Public Institutions and to ensure that their teams do as well. New members of the Public Affairs Department are trained on the governance of Public Affairs and the corporate policies that apply to Public Affairs. Incentive plans for the Public Affairs Department include, as part of their goals, meeting the Company strategic plan which cite Stellantis\u2019 environmental objectives. The Public Affairs Department may be audited by the Internal Audit Department which acts independently. Stellantis\u2019 audit plan is based on a risk assessment process and is updated at regular intervals throughout the year. If, pursuant to the risks assessment, they were identified as being risky, they would be added to the audit plan.\n\n- **Transparency**: For each CSR macro risk, the Company outlines its public position in the CSR report. Contributions to public debates are in line with the described position, taking into account the local context. In order to ensure transparency in its dealing with public authorities, the Company complies with the international rules governing influential practices. Stellantis reports as required by law the activities and interactions between Stellantis and authorities and complies with the obligation of disclosure in the relevant registers of interest. For instance, in the U.S., federal lobbying is regulated by the U.S. Congress. Stellantis files quarterly reports that disclose spending on relevant activities and the specific topics addressed in interactions with particular public officials. Similarly, we register in the transparency register in the EU, in France and in Germany.\n\n- **Political neutrality**: Stellantis applies a policy of political neutrality; it does not make financial contributions to political parties or political candidates, in conformance with the Code of Conduct and the Charter for relations with Public Institutions.\n5.1.6 ALLOCATED RESOURCES TO ACHIEVE OUR ETHICAL OBJECTIVES\n\nStellantis has allocated human and economic resources to maximize the attainment of its ethical objectives. Currently approximately 300 persons work within the Audit and Compliance organization, out of which more than 40 are devoted to Compliance. There are audit leads for each Stellantis business region, and auditors and investigators in major cities where Stellantis has a presence. There is one Compliance lead for the Americas, and another for ROW (all other regions), with some shared global responsibilities between the two. The Chief Audit and Compliance Officer has a budget designed to allow the organization to meet its objectives, which is reviewed and approved by the Ethics and Compliance Committee after careful deliberation. The Audit and Compliance budget is approximately \u20ac42 million in 2022. The ethics and compliance objectives include a focus on the Code of Conduct, the Integrity Helpline, Conflicts of Interest, Anti-Bribery/Corruption, Gifts and Entertainment, Risk Management; Third Party Management; Compliance Culture/Training, Protecting Assets, Charitable Giving, Export and Trade Regulations and others.\nEvery year, Stellantis\u2019 memberships worldwide for the following year are reviewed and formally approved by the relevant EVP. As such, the General Counsel, with oversight over Stellantis Public Affairs, reviewed and approved the Public Affairs\u2019 spending of the Company. In 2022, the Company consolidated its global budget for public affairs activities for the first time, yielding a budget of \u20ac10.66 million. This amount represents both the amount spent internally as well as the amount spent in Auto Associations and is detailed per region in the table below:\n\n| Contribution in million \u20ac | Internal | Auto Associations | Total |\n|---------------------------|----------|-------------------|-------|\n| Enlarged Europe 2022      | 1.38     | 2.47              | 3.85  |\n| North America 2022        | 2.07*    | 3.4               | 5.47  |\n| South America 2022        | 0.23     | 0.8               | 0.99  |\n| Asia 2022                 | 0        | 0.3               | 0.25  |\n| Middle East & Africa 2022 | 0        | 0                 | 0.00  |\n| China 2022                | 0        | 0.01              | 0.01  |\n| **Total 2022**            | **3.68** | **6.9**           | **10.58** |\n\n* In the U.S., federal lobbying costs are reported based on the definitions included in the lobbying and tax laws. Lobbying costs are not reported in Canada and Mexico.\n\n** The 2021 amounts are the result of a different calculation methodology and are not directly comparable.\n\nIn order to ensure consistency of reported amount on a worldwide basis, in 2022, Stellantis is reporting expenditures related to these activities on a global basis where a public affairs team is present. In 2021, the amount spent were using different allocations, for instance only 25% of the association\u2019s costs were included in the EU budget and is therefore not directly comparable with 2022.\n\nThe internal spending includes:\n\n- labor costs (including General and administrative costs) for hours spent (100%)\n- amount paid to third party firms (100%), and\n- travel, meals, and other expenses incurred (100%).\n\nOur corporate policy does not allow financial contributions to political parties and prohibits financial relations with officials, therefore is no such amount reported in the resources spend on public affairs activities.\n\nThe Automotive Associations amounts are the amount (spent in membership fees in 2022). We elected to focus on the Auto Associations memberships, as these are the main external conduit through which Stellantis undertakes activities that could be considered as lobbying. Note, that Stellantis is a member of other associations for a variety of purposes, including information gathering or negotiations with unions; those associations may undertake activities considered as well.\n5.1.7 INITIATIVES AND ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE PURSUIT OF ETHICAL EXCELLENCE\n\nThe Company has launched, and will continue to launch, various initiatives designed to continue developing its ethical culture. Some notable initiatives in 2022 include the following:\n\nAudits\n\nInternal Audit and Compliance Department includes regulatory compliance and the Ethics and Compliance Program within the scope of its annual audit plan. Pursuant to the department\u2019s procedures for the selections of topics for internal audits, the department may choose to review adherence to policies dealing with competition, anti-corruption, data privacy, export controls and other compliance-related topics.\n\nAt appropriate times, the Company selects external parties to conduct audits of specific functions. External Audits performed by independent auditors include topics such as Integrity Helpline, emissions-related regulatory compliance, environmental health and safety, and energy management systems. The Integrity Helpline and compliance with emissions regulations as well as applicable agreements with certain governing agencies are audited by those governmental agencies, while environmental health and safety, and energy management systems are audited by an accredited ISO Certification body.\n\nAs mentioned above in section 5.1.3, the Company also conducts a Compliance Assessment to ensure that the Ethics and Compliance Program identifies compliance risks, takes proper steps to mitigate such risks, and does so in an efficient manner. This process includes information from various internal sources, but also incorporates benchmarking from organizations devoted to corporate ethics, such as Ethisphere.\n\nCommunications and Trainings\n\nIn 2021 the Company set out to build an ethical culture for the new Stellantis, emphasizing messages from the CEO and senior leaders about the Code of Conduct and Integrity Helpline. In 2022, the Company continued the Code of Conduct, the anti-corruption and Data privacy trainings started in 2021.\n\nEthics and compliance e-learnings\n\n| Areas                        | Number of hours | Number of Employee trained | % of employees trained vs target |\n|------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Code of Conduct (2021-2022)  | 51,827          | 77,353                     | 90%                             |\n| Anti-corruption (2021-2022)  | 22,078          | 29,437                     | 99%                             |\n| Data privacy (2021-2022)     | 33,506          | 79,777                     | 93%                             |\n| Total                        | 107,411         |                            |                                 |\nIn 2022, the Company focused on enhancing the workforce\u2019s awareness and knowledge of its policies and procedures, through the roll-out of awareness initiatives such as the Virtual T-shirts program (where compliance topics appear in virtual t-shirts) and the Always With Integrity video series by senior leaders.\n\nIn the second part of the year, the Company launched the Ethical Culture Survey, the first step of the new Ethics Experience initiative aimed to engage the workforce around ethics and compliance. According to the results of the survey, 95% of respondents believed the Code of Conduct was easy to understand and relevant, and that the Company is living the principles established in the Code of Conduct. By December 2022, 77,353 people had been trained, comprising 90 percent of the active white collar employees at the end of the year.\n\nThe Company also launched an anti-corruption e-learning training in late 2021 and at the end of September 2022, 29,438 employees had completed the course.\n\nIn 2022, Stellantis proposed corporate trainings to managers to prevent Fraud and classrooms (The Ethical Leadership Engagement Program) to create an ethical and transparent environment. These classrooms were launched in Q3 is targeted to middle managers of which 8,308 were trained in 2022.\n\nWhite collar employees were also trained through e-learning to understand why reporting is essential for the Company and how to lift the barriers of reporting and to overcome them.\n\n### 2022 Ethics and compliance training initiatives\n\n| In 2022                                      | Number of hours | Number of employee trained | % of the targeted employee |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Phishing (completed)                          | 18,246          | 72,984                     | 94%                       |\n| Fraud prevention e-learning (for Managers only) in progress | 40,062          | 40,062                     | 82%                       |\n| Ethical leadership classroom (for Managers only) in progress | 6,231           | 8,308                      | 62%                       |\n| Speak-up!

In 2022, the Integrity Helpline developed special modules for the reporting of gifts and entertainment expense. The Stellantis Integrity Helpline is available 24/7 by phone or web and is designed to ensure that any suspected violations of our Code of Conduct can be reported, received, and resolved properly and efficiently.\nOur \u201cAlways with Integrity\u201d campaign highlights the availability of the reporting system for all types of concerns, including vehicle safety and regulatory concerns. This system continues to be provided by a specialized independent service provider and used for reporting investigations by trained and skilled resources. It is open to workforce members, business partners and other stakeholders and is accessible on Stellantis\u2019 website. As in 2021, workforce members have the ability to raise questions about the Code of Conduct or reports of potential violations to their direct supervisors and the Human Resources, Compliance, and Legal Departments.\n\n**Integrity Helpline case resolution process**\n\nFor all reports received of alleged violations to the Code of Conduct, a preliminary assessment of the allegation is performed by the Integrity Helpline Regional Delegate, who assigns a priority to the case based on specific criteria. A personalized response is provided to the reporter and if necessary a request for further information. The case is then assigned to a specific team of trained and specialized investigators. Upon completion of the investigation an outcome of Confirmed; Not Confirmed; Not Confirmed with Issue is assigned to the case and any potential action plans to be implemented are proposed by management. The Stellantis Regional Ethics and Compliance Committees (ECC) are periodically presented with the proposed final case disposition and remediation actions, for approval. Only cases meeting specific escalation criteria are reported to the Global ECC and subsequently to the Audit Committee. Final feedback is provided to the reporter.\n\n**PROCESS FLOW FOR ALLEGATIONS OF NON-COMPLIANCE**\n\n![Process Flow Diagram](https://www.stellantis.com/en/company/governance/how-to-report-a-violation-of-the-code-of-conduct)\n\nAny doubts on Code of Conduct violations?\n\n- **SPEAK TO**\n  - Direct Supervisor\n  - Compliance Department\n  - Human Resources\n  - Legal Department\n\n- **REPORT TO**\n  - THE INTEGRITY HELPLINE\n  - www.integrityhelpline.stellantis.com\nIn 2022 there was an overall increase in cases with respect to the previous year. The trend of received cases was notably impacted by the new Stellantis Integrity Helpline system launched in November 2021, that was supported by Communication and Training initiatives which continued throughout 2022 and ensured a significant increase of awareness.\n\n| Category                        | 2022 | 2021 | % of allegations received |\n|---------------------------------|------|------|---------------------------|\n| Protecting our workforce        | 1,413| 1,077| 76%                       |\n| Conducting business             | 68   | 36   | 4%                        |\n| Interacting with external parties| 67   | 60   | 4%                        |\n| Managing our assets and information | 314  | 351  | 17%                       |\n| Total                           | 1,862| 1,524| 100%                      |\n\n**Sanctions and Export Controls**\n\nThe 2022 Russia/Ukraine conflict required the Company to devote special attention to the controls designed to ensure regulatory compliance with economic sanctions and export controls (\u201cSanctions\u201d). In addition to ad-hoc informational flows to ensure awareness of Sanctions and avoid unintentional violations, in 2022 the Company audited its Sanctions vetting program and expanded the application of its vetting protocols with a new service provider to include vetting of its business partners that identifies when a business partner is owned in greater than 50% by a person or entity that is blocked pursuant to Sanctions.\n\n**Third Party Due Diligence**\n\nIn January of 2022 the Company published its Third Party Due Diligence Policy and concluded its basic harmonization of the due diligence processes of Groupe PSA and FCA N.V. into a single process for Stellantis. A detailed Procedure was published internally in May. The Third Party Due Diligence program is conducted with a specialized external service provider and selects business partners for due diligence on the basis of risk criteria that are described in the Procedure. Those criteria include corruption perception for the jurisdiction, financial exposure, and nature of business conducted with the business partner. Due diligence reports of various levels of depth are obtained for selected business partners depending on the level of overall risk identified. Once a business partner is in the due diligence system, continuous monitoring tools (operating 24/7) will search an extensive data lake of information...\nsources for any risk-related information related to that business partner, resulting in relevant alerts for Stellantis. The due diligence information is made available to management for the purposes of determining whether to do business, or to continue doing business, with the parties that are the subject of due diligence. The first launch of the new process occurred in the second half of 2022, and included due diligence on approximately 500 dealers in high-risk jurisdictions, and 500 suppliers that represent approximately 80% of the Company\u2019s annual spend.\n\n5.1.8 DETAILED KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\nThe following table sets out in full the automotive associations to whom we adhered in 2022.\n\n| FUNCTION OR REGION | COUNTRY | ASSOCIATION |\n|--------------------|---------|-------------|\n| CHINA              | China   | CATARC (China Automotive Technology and Research Center) |\n| ENLARGED EUROPE    | UK      | SMMT (Society of Motors Manufacturers & Traders) |\n|                    | Belgium | ACEA (European Automobile Manufacturers Association) |\n|                    | France  | PFA Plateform Automobile, CCFA (Comit\u00e9 des Constructeurs Fran\u00e7ais Automobiles) |\n|                    | Germany | Verband der Automobilindustrie e.

Internet users who are not well-versed in the legal issues surrounding the privacy of information are becoming increasingly wary. This leads more and more regulators all over the world to define privacy regulations in order to protect fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons concerning their personal information. The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which entered into force on May 25, 2018, is one of the first and most complete regulation, but other countries define their own local regulation (e.g. California Consumer Privacy Act, LGPD Brazilian data protection law).\n\nThe challenges for companies consist of implementing all due processes fulfilling related regulations such as the European General Data Protection Regulation and others, especially by providing customers\u2019 clear and transparent information. Stellantis aims to maintain a relationship founded on trust by working to ensure that personal data is kept confidential and only processed for valid purposes. Because the trust of our customers, employees and other concerned data subjects is fundamental, we take actions to adhere to data protection rules.\n\nFor Stellantis, the collection and processing of personal data is essential to bring customers the benefits from innovative services and products, these processes are intended to ensure full compliance with data privacy regulations.\n\nThe Company is committed to the legitimate protection of consumer information and striving to ensure safety and security of data. These activities also support the Company\u2019s performance.\n\nCompany transformation through the software strategy\n\nOn Software Day December 7, 2021, Stellantis mapped out its software strategy to deploy next-generation tech platforms, building on existing connected vehicle capabilities to transform how customers interact with their vehicles.\n\nThis transformation will move Stellantis\u2019 vehicles from today\u2019s dedicated electronic architectures to an open software-defined platform that seamlessly integrates with customers\u2019 digital lives. This platform is designed to greatly expand the options offered to customers who can add, with their consent, innovative features and services via regular over-the-air (OTA) updates keeping vehicles fresh, exciting and updated years after they have been built.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nWe commit to protecting customers\u2019 and employees\u2019 personal data, and more globally personal data of all categories of data subjects. Mostly based on the European Data Protection Regulation and of corresponding regulations in other\njurisdictions, we respect the privacy requirements of customers\u2019 personal data for both current customers that use products and services, and prospective customers where data is obtained via Stellantis websites, apps, in the network or in-vehicle systems. We work to ensure that they are used appropriately while maintaining the principles relating to processing personal data such as lawfulness, fairness, transparency, data minimization, storage and purpose limitation, integrity and confidentiality. We implement processes to respect customers\u2019 preferred contact methods to ensure that each customer has control over his personal data shared with our Company.\n\nThe protection of personal data is considered a fundamental right for customers and it is an important factor of confidence and loyalty contributing towards satisfaction.\n\nThe Company through its participation in the discussions led by local and European bodies such as CCFA (Comit\u00e9 des Constructeurs Automobiles Fran\u00e7ais), VDA (Verband der Automobilindustrie) and Unione Industriale Association (Italy), works with the European authorities to shape how the GDPR is applied to vehicle manufacturers\u2019 activities as well as to share a common understanding of privacy regulations related to new technologies applied to connected vehicles.\n\nThe Company has already committed to the essential principles of GDPR \u201cPrivacy by Design\u201d and \u201cPrivacy by Default\u201d and is consistently improving the security of its data storage and exchange networks, especially with the connected car that has transformed vehicle manufacturers into experienced players on the subject of data protection. It carries out training and awareness-raising actions within the Company and takes part in working groups among professionals to foster the exchange of best practices. It consistently monitors the fulfillment of privacy regulations and works to take appropriate action when potential issues are identified.\n\n5.2.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\nCommitment scoreboard\n\n| CSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE | VISION/AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | RESULTS |\n|----------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|---------|\n| Responsible management of personal information | Protect personal data by processing information confidentially and according to applicable data protection regulations | % of complaints raised by Supervisory Authorities from customer privacy/data protection infringements handled within 1 month (and/or due date required by the Authorities) | Short-term: 2022: 100% | 2022: 100% |\n| | | | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan): 2030: 100% | 2030: 100% |\n| | | | Long-term: 2040: 100% | 2040: 100% |\n| | | | 2022: 100% | 100% |\n| | | | 2030: 100% | 100% |\n| | | | 2040: 100% | 100% |\n5.2.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nPrivacy being now considered and understood as part of the fundamental rights and freedoms of persons, protection of personal data by Stellantis is taken into account at the earliest stage possible in our activities to avoid risks for data subjects and risks for the Company in terms of compliance with privacy regulations, reputation and operational efficiency.\n\nOf course, our first priority is to avoid risks for data subjects themselves when we process personal information of our customers, employees and other concerned data subjects.\n\n5.2.3.1 Risks\n\nThe Company is managing three main categories of risks in this area:\n\n- Non-compliance with existing and future regulations, that may lead to fines (e.g. up to 4% of annual turnover for European GDPR): Risks of non-compliance are mainly addressed by the privacy governance within the Company, but are also addressed through the training on privacy topics of our employees and by the management of our suppliers and partners with regards to privacy topics.\n\n- Reputational risks, that may lead to a deterioration of our image and impact on sales: Risks of reputation are addressed by providing transparent and clear information to data subjects (e.g. customers, employees) and by providing them with easy access to their personal information.\n\n- Risks related to operational efficiency, that may lead to redevelop existing non-compliant products and service: Risks due to inefficient internal processes, in terms of personal data protection, may concern various activities of the Company, such as:\n  - development of our products or services: the risks to develop non-compliant product or services (e.g. vehicles or other means of mobility\u2019s development and more generally all necessary IT development we need for our activity) with regards to privacy regulations are addressed by a strong deployment of our \u201cPrivacy by Design\u201d methodologies, aims to include the privacy requirements to enable products and services) to fulfil privacy regulations in internal projects methods.\n  - Risks related to security vulnerabilities that could generate cyber-attacks or data breaches: they are addressed to handle them by operational procedures and by the global IT and cybersecurity monitoring of the Company.\n\n5.2.3.2 Opportunities\n\nThe Company\u2019s expertise in addressing and mitigating these risks opens opportunities:\n\n- Implementing \u201cPrivacy by Design\u201d methods and having cybersecurity standards help the Company to develop and to commercialize new products and services in a responsible way.\nWorking to being recognized as a Company that takes care of personal information of its customers and employees allows to maintain the confidence in our Company of our customers and partners for our products and services. This may notably support:\n\n- our business development by increasing the number and the quality of the marketing leads\n- the improvement of our products and services and to develop new ones thanks to the data and feedbacks our customers accept to give us.\n\n5.2.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nThe Stellantis Global Cybersecurity and Privacy Committee was established in 2021 to govern and monitor cybersecurity and privacy risks in our ICT systems, products and services. It is co-chaired by the Chief Human Resources and Transformation Officer and the Chief Financial Officer and it steers the cybersecurity and privacy programs for Stellantis.\n\nAs part of the Global Ethics and Compliance Program, the Stellantis N.V. Data Protection Officer (DPO) is the General Counsel of Stellantis, reporting to the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nAs of September 1, 2022 a Privacy Office was established and the activities were organized by areas of responsibility at global level for providing data privacy support:\n\n- Customer and ICT processes (including digital marketing, web sites, data analytic, data lake, software initiatives);\n- Product Development processes (including, autonomous driving, connectivity, artificial intelligence);\n- HR processes.\n\nAt regional and business level, responsibility for providing data privacy support is assigned for each Regions as follow: Enlarged Europe to the Head of Stellantis Privacy Office above mentioned. For the other Regions (North America, South America, India Asia Pacific/China, Middle East and Africa) and for Businesses (Maserati, COMAU) to the respective General Counsel, in each case with the support of the Regional Privacy Teams comprised of representatives of Legal and ICT.\n\nThe Company\u2019s DPO is responsible to:\n\n- monitor and promote the data privacy compliance\n- define and provide guidance to the organization on requirements of relevant data privacy regulations\n- monitor compliance with the rules of personal data protection\n- inform, advise and issue recommendations\n- establish the respective data protection culture\n- cooperate with the respective responsible Supervisory Authorities on issues related to the processing of personal data.\nTwo networks of in-house representatives back up the Company\u2019s DPO:\n\n- for business divisions: the compliance champions\n- for European National Sales Companies: several managers within Stellantis ensure integration by design for the protection of personal data and compliance when processing the affected activities, even when working with external subcontractors or services. Each employee is involved in respecting the Company\u2019s data protection policies.\n\n5.2.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nStellantis sets up the proper governance and control structures, methods and procedures, regarding the protection of personal data by:\n\n- giving transparent information to customers, employees and other data subject\n- improving the efficiency of consent management\n- helping data subjects to exercise their rights regarding their personal data\n- implementing \u201cPrivacy by Design/by Default\u201d principles during projects\n- improving the security of our data storage and networks\n- monitoring potential security breaches and applying data breaches procedures\n- ensuring the same level of data protection from our subcontractors\n- raising awareness or training the managers and the employees\n- monitoring and periodically auditing the organization\n- maintaining close and confident relationships with Data Protection Authorities.\n\n5.2.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nIn order to ensure the implementation of data privacy policies along with decisions taken by the Company, notably we have set up the following organization to respect the essential principles of \u201cPrivacy by Design\u201d and \u201cPrivacy by Default\u201d:\n\n- consistently improving the security of its data storage and exchange by the IT department\n- working to adapt developments methods for IT, Sales and Marketing, Mobility services, and for Engineering\n- providing privacy trainings for project managers, engineering teams (to comply with the \u201cPrivacy by Design\u201d principle for vehicles and connected services) and frontlines (e.g., vendors in the dealership)\n- all the employees in charge for processing the data received the necessary operational instructions\n- operating a strong information system security policy\nmonitoring of system performance or service disruptions: the digitization of a large part of our relationship with our customers, notably now including online sales and payments makes it crucial that access to network, IT systems and data is assured at all times\n\ncontingency plans, to ensure business continuity in case of technical failure, human error, malicious attacks, weather events, natural disasters or terrorist attacks.\n\nIn addition, every department and concerned legal entity shall keep updated its legally required records of processing activities. The Internal Audit regularly audits the organization. In 2022, two audits on data privacy were conducted: Connected Vehicles Data Privacy review in Q2 (perimeter: vehicles sales in Enlarged Europe, North America and South America) and Customer Experience survey Audit and Data Privacy Historical Data Management\n\nPeriodically, privacy self-assessments are proposed to specific business entities to improve the awareness of managers and to measure the level of GDPR maturity. Based on the findings of Internal Audits, the results and verbatim of the annual self-assessment, and the achievement of improvement action plans, Stellantis DPO can identify the needs in further enhancements for the internal privacy training, templates of privacy notices, templates of privacy agreements in contracts (Data Processing Agreement).\n\nThe Company participates actively in discussions led by local and European bodies such as VDA (Verband der Automobilindustrie), Unione Industriale Association (Italy), sharing best practices to comply with privacy regulations relating to new technologies applied to the automotive sector, in particular with the increasing relevance of connected vehicles.\n\n5.2.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nIn order to provide transparent information to customers, periodic update of all privacy statements were carried out along with consistent improvement of information provided to customers about the different purpose of use and the processing of their personal data in the vehicle.\n\nMoreover, the Company has implemented \u2013 and continues to implement \u2013 several measures, such as:\n\n- improve the communication with our customer in relation to their questions and requests. In particular the procedure relating to the data subject rights is constantly updated in an effort to comply with the more recent data protection authorities guidelines\n\n- aim at improving the efficiency of consent management. During 2022, the Company checked privacy statements to detect non-compliant consent issues, also leveraging on the design and implementation of a central tool for consent management\n\n- ensure the same level of Stellantis data protection from the Company\u2019s business partners, a template of the GDPR addendum to supplier contracts \u201cData Processing Agreement\u201d has been defined based on the templates provided by European Union; and our buyers are expected to be trained on using these documents.\nFurther periodic meetings were held with the professional associations, notably in France, Germany and Italy directly with the local Supervisory Authorities. Referring to the relation with the French Data Protection Commission (CNIL), the Company was involved in an active process leading the CNIL publication of a \u201cconformity package for connected vehicles\u201d in 2017, which explains how privacy regulations apply to the vehicle and connected services. This \u201cconformity package\u201d has been raised at European level. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) guidelines have been published early 2021 after having been discussed at ACEA level in 2020, especially with the participation of Stellantis.\n\nAs announced in the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, Stellantis plans to launch a Big Data platform to improve Customer experience. A specific Data Business Unit named Mobilisights was set up to drive the new business.\n\nInfringement of consumer privacy regulations\n\n(GDPR and local data protection regulation, European scope)\n\nThe Company is subject to governmental investigations and legal proceeding on privacy.\n\nFCA Italy S.p.A. in 2022 received two final judgments from the Italian Data Protection Authority relating to data subject/customer complaints on GDPR provisions that occurred in 2017 and in 2021. The fine was not material, however, from 2017, FCA Italy S.p.A. has improved the process relating to the data subject exercise of their rights and set up a dedicated Portal.\n\nWith the aim to monitor the data management processes, Stellantis examines the following indicators that could represent a warning on the potential failure of privacy compliance:\n\n| INCIDENTS & BREACHES | 2022 |\n|----------------------|------|\n| DATA BREACHES        | The data breaches are managed under policies implemented in and promptly managed engaging all the main stakeholders in time and addressing the necessary countermeasures. The activity is performed in strict coordination with the Information and Technology Dept., Cybersecurity Dept. and our legal team. |\n| CUSTOMERS CLAIMS     | The Stellantis Companies/Data Controllers, if requested by the local regulations, provide in the privacy notice the contact details to exercise the data subject rights. The DPO teams are constantly involved in the process to manage the data subject requests. |\n| AUTHORITY REQUESTS & INSPECTION RESULTS | The Authority requests are promptly managed with the support of the DPO teams. In 2022 FCA Italy S.p.A. received 2 prescriptions and fines not material relating to claim of customer occurred in 2017 and in 2021. |\n\nIn 2022, 100 percent of complaints raised by supervisory Authorities for customer privacy/data protection infringements were handled within one month and/or the due date required by these Authorities. The results for 2021 were also 100 percent.\n5.3 Responsible information to customer\n\n5.3.1 CONTEXT AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\nCSR issue/challenge #13: Responsible information to customers\n\nStellantis works to provide responsible information to the customer and to align its marketing practices with sustainability guidelines. The Company strives to be transparent by adhering to fair marketing practices in its consumer-facing communications. We are committed to accountability of information in customer facing communications as well as environmental issues in line with applicable regulations (including CO\u2082 reduction, protection of biodiversity and natural habitats), health and safety.\n\nStellantis has set requirements for the marketing operations teams to achieve the targeted objectives. The Company also advertises its products and services in ways that are intended to follow the regional regulations and encourage responsible behavior by encouraging vehicle owners to use them in a safe and efficient way, notably in terms of fuel economy, CO\u2082 emissions, and respecting the safety rules of the road.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nStellantis perceives Marketing\u2019s role as an opportunity to innovate, create competitive advantages, and inform and educate consumers in their choices and actions. It is our position outlining the north star for fair, data-driven marketing practices will be the key competitive edge in the current trust revolution where consumers want to be recognized, treated uniquely, and have their personal information protected and handled carefully.\n\nLimitations on advertising, however, might have an impact on sales of new vehicles, with advertising being a market animation tool.\n\nStellantis\u2019s brands, through their engagement in local and national advertiser associations, look for opportunities to participate in workshops on legal developments (i.e., environmental requirements in advertising, right for customers to refuse to be contacted by brands, etc.) and external stakeholders\u2019 expectations in terms of responsible communications and marketing to eliminate misleading advertising and unfair competition in the field of commercial communications.\n5.3.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\nCommitment scoreboard\n\n| CSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE | VISION/AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | RESULTS |\n|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|---------|\n| Responsible information to customers | Provide accurate and comprehensive information to consumers through responsible marketing practices in all mass market communications, and engage them with direct communication only when consumers request it | Number of convictions of non-compliance concerning: \u2022 product and service information and labeling \u2022 marketing communications | Short-term: 2022: Zero convictions Worldwide | In 2022, Stellantis was found liable in two material matters that involved marketing or labeling issues, in the U.S. and Korea. See \u201cFY 2022 MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 Stellantis Overview \u2013 Legal Proceedings \u2013 Emissions Matters\u201d for a description of these two matters |\n|                      |                 |                | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan): 2030: Zero convictions Worldwide | |\n|                      |                 |                | Long-term: 2050: Zero convictions Worldwide | No material convictions noticed |\n\n5.3.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nThe Company\u2019s continued success is dependent on having a deep understanding of our customers while taking into account the challenges and the opportunities to address changing consumer expectations and emerging trends by offering an attractive portfolio of products.\n\n5.3.3.1 Risks\n\nThe marketing practices are designed to reduce and mitigate risks the Company might be facing:\n\n- customers\u2019 expectations of brands with respect to the environment and sustainability may not be aligned to brands\u2019 awareness to make a difference, particularly to help customers make better and conscious choices. Brands risk losing customers to competitors if they don\u2019t guide them along their sustainable journey\n- Stellantis brands have a responsibility to publicly share their environmental sustainment progress and commitments. Commitments are shared primarily via regional communications. However, the Jeep Brand hold global press events due to their global footprint\n- in addition, our business operations and reputation may be impacted by various types of claims, lawsuits, and other contingencies in case of noncompliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations\n- with global access to digital marketing assets, the Company can be also exposed to fines if some assets from other countries are accessible and non-compliant with local regulations.\n5.3.3.2 Opportunities\n\nResponsible marketing practices open opportunities for Stellantis:\n\n- Communication recognized as responsible, transparent and easy to access (making content available to all), allowing customers to be more aware when choosing a product (products and services) contributes to differentiate Company\u2019s products encouraging customer loyalty.\n\n- Marketing teams leverage their expertise to define brand strategies and implement plans that answer questions also related to environmental and societal challenges including transparency, responsiveness and diversity. An effective brand strategy and a clear set of brand values helps brand management teams capture market opportunities, implement long-term visions and support Stellantis\u2019 contribution to shape a more sustainable future.\n\n- A fair brand enhances a company\u2019s reputation while any unfair behavior can affect corporate intangible assets. Fair branding provides Stellantis with a differential advantage as a growing number of consumers become more conscious.\n\n5.3.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nThe Chief Sales & Marketing Officer, who is a member of the Top Executive Team and reports directly to the CEO, is responsible for a Stellantis common marketing strategy supported by CEOs of the brands, tasked with all aspects of brand strategy mission, development and positioning. Each brand has its own market share targets, brand image objectives and positioning, and is linked to the corporate values by a common marketing strategy.\n\nStellantis offers a wide spectrum of choice from luxury, premium, and mainstream passenger vehicles to pickup trucks, SUVs and light commercial vehicles, as well as dedicated mobility, financial and parts and service brands.\n\nThe focus of the Marketing and Communications organizations is to increase the value of the brands through the development of a strategic vision for the business, on-brand marketing materials, and consumer facing communications that intend to excite and create demand for our brands and products, realize relevant synergies and share best practices.\n\nBeing aware that an effective brand strategy and a clear set of brand values can support the Company to implement corporate long-term visions, the Chief Sales and Marketing Officer leverages its internal committees such as the Monthly Global Sales and Marketing Committee and the Brand Committee to coordinate marketing strategies, define priorities, ensure consistency and alignment with corporate values and implementation of responsible practices across regions.\n\nThe fulfillment of each brand strategy needs the alignment of all brand employees, as their individual commitment drives the performance of a model and/or country, efficiency of processes and sales volumes. Those efforts contribute to the achievement of the brands\u2019 targets.\n5.3.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nAware of the social role that advertising plays, the Company has adopted customer-centric positive values, a responsible approach to communication and a sense of care towards future generations. In June 2022, Stellantis has made public its first Responsible Marketing, Advertising and Communication Guidelines available on the Company\u2019s website (Corporate Regulations | Stellantis) which clearly define the commitment to integrity and compliance in its communication and advertising.\n\nThese guidelines have been developed:\n- to set and maintain standards of honesty, truth, accuracy and fairness in communication\n- to provide the criteria for responsible and sustainable advertising, marketing and communication\n- to form a basis upon which Stellantis\u2019 communication is evaluated in response to stakeholders\u2019 request.\n\nThe purpose of these Guidelines is to apply Stellantis\u2019 societal and environmental requirements to all forms of public communication and to take into account both:\n- national regulations in countries where Stellantis operates\n- the International Commercial Chamber Advertising and Marketing Code Reference document: ICC Code of Advertising and Commercial Communication Practices (2018, 10th revision), which consists of a globally applicable and recognized self-regulatory framework.\n\nOn the basis of its Responsible Marketing, Advertising and Communication Guidelines, Stellantis is committed to integrity and compliance in its communication and advertising, and aims at meeting three key principles:\n\n1. All communication should be designed keeping in mind our societal responsibility, outlined in detail in 5.3.7 below, by:\n   - respecting human dignity and encouraging diversity\n   - respecting Stellantis\u2019 social commitments\n   - not condoning any form of discrimination\n   - not harming the security of people or property\n   - not inciting drivers to act violently or endanger other road users\n   - being honest and truthful.\n\n2. All communication should be designed keeping in mind Stellantis\u2019 environmental responsibility, by:\n   - presenting environmental expressions in an honest and truthful way, respectful of country regulation concerning advertising films involving vehicles\n   - monitoring that supplier communications adhere to Stellantis\u2019 environmental and social requirements.\n\n3. All communication should be designed keeping in mind the potential financial impact on the customer, by:\n   - communicating commercial offers clearly and honestly\n   - not minimizing the importance of the financial commitment concerning lease or purchase financing offers.\n\nFor more information refer to 5.3.7\nStellantis aspires to:\n\n- provide accurate and comprehensive information through responsible marketing practices in all mass-market consumer communications. This commitment concerns all public-aimed advertising or communication broadcast on traditional media channels (TV, radio, billboard, press, etc.), on internet (websites, social media, emailing, mobile applications, online games, direct marketing, etc.) as well as commercial messages of any kind whether in print, sales promotion and merchandising materials.\n\n- honestly and clearly communicate with customers regarding environmental responsibility, allowing them to identify the most efficient vehicle choice in terms of emissions reduction (e.g., Peugeot the \u201cPOWER OF CHOICE\u201d strategy).\n\n- make statement and representations in advertising comply with all relevant laws and regulations in the local country and design processes to help advertising, marketing and media communications to be truthful and reflect the Company\u2019s fair sense of social and environmental responsibility contributing to the development of the next urban landscape (e.g., Citro\u00ebn oli [all-\u00eb] concept).\n\n5.3.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nStellantis and its brands\u2019 public-aimed communication and marketing are aligned with its corporate positive values and with best marketing practices as outlined in its Responsible Marketing, Advertising and Communication Guidelines. These Guidelines are published publically on the Stellantis corporate website and implemented by the Stellantis relevant functions (e.g., Marketing, Advertising, Communications Departments) as well as by agencies and suppliers on a global scope both as part of a supplier onboarding package and available on Stellantis supplier web portals.\n\nEach Stellantis department proposing an advertisement has the responsibility to ensure compliance.\n\nSpecific organizations are involved with the development and review of advertising, marketing and other media communications such as, Legal Department, Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Affairs, to assure that any statements and representations made in advertising are accurate and properly substantiated. Special attention will be paid to environmentally-focused messaging to ensure there is no misperception of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d.\n\nMany Company\u2019s brands also interact with associations and advertising regulation agencies. For example, in Europe some brands submit advertising communications to national advertising regulation agencies and/or their legal departments. Thus, in France, the Autorit\u00e9 de R\u00e9gulation Professionnelle de la Publicit\u00e9 (ARPP) controls TV commercials, in order to ensure notably that their content complies with the local advertising regulations and does not contain stereotypes. In 2022, Peugeot, Citro\u00ebn and DS French marketing teams renewed their commitment to apply the Union des Marques (UDM) FAIRe program, for responsible communication.\nTraining on responsible marketing practices and responsible use of social media\n\nA global curriculum was engaged in 2022 to train marketing, sales and public relations professionals on the requirements communication in the Responsible Advertising, Marketing and Communication guidelines. The mandatory training is planned to be provided to these employees in 2023.\n\n5.3.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nIMPACT MEASUREMENT OF ELECTRIFICATION AND SOFTWARE STRATEGY\n\nDuring a corporate strategy presentation held on March 1, 2022, Stellantis unveiled Dare Forward 2030, a bold strategic plan for the coming decade, that will aim to drive Stellantis employees to be \u2018second to none\u2019 in value creation for all stakeholders. Stellantis committed to become the industry champion in the fight against climate change, reaching carbon net zero emissions by 2038.\n\nWithin this presentation, Stellantis reiterated their focus on \u201ccustomer first\u201d programs, which include clear and responsible communication practices. \u201cThe customer is at the heart of everything we do. We aim to be No. 1 in customer satisfaction for our products and services in every market. We will pay exceptional attention to the full end-to-end experience, working to eliminate any friction throughout the value chain.\u201d\n\nThe Dare Forward 2030 program also highlighted the current and future importance of selling vehicles online. Stellantis plans to reach one-third of global sales online in 2030 and launch a global digital marketplace offering customers a seamless journey through the entire Stellantis galaxy of products and services. The e-commerce buying process will be clearly and directly communicated to customers with pricing transparency.\n\nE-COMMERCE IS OUR SALES MOTTO\n\nDare Forward 2030 builds on the value shared during EV and Software strategy announcements in 2021.\nDuring the EV Day held on July 8, 2021, Stellantis presented a comprehensive electrification strategy delivering class-leading vehicles for the Company\u2019s iconic brands, partnerships and joint ventures for advanced technology at affordable prices.\n\n\u201cThe customer is always at the heart of Stellantis and our commitment with this \u20ac30 billion plus investment plan is to offer iconic vehicles that have the performance, capability, style, comfort and electric range that fit seamlessly into their daily lives,\u201d said on that day Carlos Tavares, Chief Executive Officer, Stellantis.\n\nIn line with this announcement, on December 7, 2021, Stellantis unveiled its software strategy to shift to a mobility tech company, confirming that each of Stellantis\u2019 brands are focused on using software to the benefit of its customers.\n\n**STELLANTIS AUTOMOTIVE BRANDS\u2019 ATTRIBUTES**\n\n- **Granturismo**\n  - LUXURY\n- **Sportiness**\n  - PREMIUM\n- **Art of Travel**\n  - PREMIUM\n- **Eleganza**\n- **Freedom**\n  - GLOBAL SPORT UTILITY\n- **Muscle**\n- **Courage**\n- **Ingenious**\n- **Allure**\n- **German Energy**\n- **Dolce Vita**\n- **Care**\n\n**AMERICAN ROOTED BRANDS**\n\n**EUROPEAN ROOTED BRANDS**\n\nWatch a replay of the 2021 EV strategy content\nhttps://evday2021.webstream.fr/vod/\n\nWatch a replay of the 2021 Software Strategy content\nhttps://channel.royalcast.com/stellantis-en/#!/stellantis-en/20211207_1\nAffordability is a priority at Stellantis, as the Company is targeting for the total cost of ownership of EVs to be equivalent to internal combustion engine vehicles by 2026. Each of the Company\u2019s 14 brands is committed to offering fully electrified solutions and doing so in a way that enhances the DNA of our brands.\n\nTo leverage this, Stellantis and its brands\u2019 public-aimed communication and marketing are aligned with its corporate positive values and with its Responsible Advertising, Marketing and Communication Guidelines which also promote honesty, truth, accuracy and fairness in communication, respect for Stellantis environmental and social requirements.\n\n**Labelling and information provided to customers**\n\nTo improve vehicle purchase information, a fuel-efficiency label is displayed in North America, Europe, China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan for each model\u2019s average fuel consumption and CO\u2082 emissions, in line with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Those labels allow to identify the most efficient vehicles in terms of fuel consumption and emissions reduction.\n\n**RESPECTING HUMAN DIGNITY AND ENCOURAGING DIVERSITY AND NOT CONDONDING ANY FORM OF DISCRIMINATION**\n\nStellantis and its brands analyze their communications to avoid offending the sensibilities, undermining a person\u2019s dignity and indecency, degrading or humiliating representation of any person, paying attention to stereotypes that could diminish any person, regardless of gender and avoiding to portray people as an object.\n\nOn this respect, some campaigns created in Europe go through a regulatory clearance via bodies such as Autorit\u00e9 de R\u00e9gulation Professionnelle de la Publicit\u00e9 (ARPP, France) or Clearcast (UK) whereas campaigns created in North America are validated by a specific consultant agency, specialized in these topics. North American brands partner work with an expert media agency serving as a consultant to ensure their general market advertising does not include stereotypes and is respectful to people of color. This same commitment has been implemented through the Citro\u00ebn C3 advertising campaigns and the Jeep Grand Wagoneer launch campaign.\n\nIn addition, Stellantis commits to gender and sexual orientation equality through targeted and mass market brand communications aligning with each brand\u2019s core values. All North American brands have created \u201cPride\u201d merchandise lines to appeal to LGBTQIA+ audiences and the Jeep Brand created brand activations at the Detroit and New York Pride parades in 2022.\nRepresenting and promoting responsible environmental and road safety behaviors\n\nOur responsibility as a Company is to create sustainable and shared value for our stakeholders. Our customers, employees, investors, suppliers and communities expect us to make a positive contribution to the economy, society and the environment. Exchanges with our stakeholders and social groups improve mutual understanding and our ability to anticipate risks and identify opportunities for value creation, key elements of the Stellantis approach.\n\nSome Stellantis brands have specific environmental visions and some communicate towards their goals and achievements on their own websites, such as www.peugeot.co.uk/about-us/environment/sustainability.html\n\nStellantis and its brands inform their stakeholders about the environmental and social impact of their products/services and educate them to encourage a responsible use.\n\nThis is the case through our circular economy initiatives, but also regarding the daily use of our products and services.\n\nCircular economy\n\nIn addition to direct promotion of spare parts from reused and remanufactured spare parts in the garages, circular economy initiatives are promoted in some regions on social media across Stellantis brands to inform consumers and increase their awareness.\n\nThus, in 2022, as a committed player in the energy transition, Citro\u00ebn launched \u00ab Citro\u00ebn Citizen Services \u00ae \u00bb a federative programme bringing together a portfolio of services under a single label, to offer responsible mobility designed to be easy to use, in line with the challenges of our society. A part of \u201cCitro\u00ebn Citizen Services \u00ae\u201d facilitates the accessibility in the maintenance of its vehicle whatever its age, with easy access to original spare parts from end-of-life vehicle. Thanks to the deployment of a dedicated website, customers are able to search for and acquire the parts they need, which will be delivered to their home. This easy and economical solution encourages consumers to keep longer their vehicle in good condition by changing parts at a lower cost. They benefit from a purchase price up to 70% lower than the price of the new part and thus contribute to the increase of the recycling rate by using second-hand parts.\n\nIn addition, Citro\u00ebn plans to offer customers of electric models the option of a Sustainable Service Contract that includes the use of recycled or remanufactured parts approved by the manufacturer, whenever possible. This will maximize the use of circular economy parts and reduce the carbon footprint of vehicle maintenance.\n\nBrands also strive to promote responsible behaviors through their online (websites, apps, etc.) and offline (TVCs, print, etc.) communication tools. This is made possible in advertising through complying to the local traffic regulations, ensuring diversity is of the essence and promoting the adoption of new energies as a better environmental choice. Surveys provide the opportunity to measure the impacts and gain insight on the perception of the brands and their messages. In the U.S., many aspects are evaluated such as trust, responsibility, safety, environmentally friendly, among other elements. Utilizing survey data helps with developing and refining the strategy to manage the brands.\nThe MyDS services\n\nMyDS app is the key to the world of DS. It connects the driver and her/his car before, during and after every journey, through features. For instance, the Connected Navigation Pack helps planning a route when the user is away from it\u2019s DS and then, to send its to the car\u2019s screen.\n\nRemote Control allows the user to lock and unlock its DS vehicle without key, simply by using MyDS app. This app also provides an access to DS Only You, a suite of bespoke services designed to make living with one\u2019s car effortless and enjoyable. In addition, for DS electric vehicles, E-TENSE Remote Control allows the user to manage the electric charging and to set the temperature inside her/his car. MyDS app, available for all DS vehicles, can be downloaded on all smartphones.\n\nCitro\u00ebn Advisor\n\nPart of the Citro\u00ebn Citizen Services\u00ae, Citro\u00ebn Advisor is Citro\u00ebn\u2019s online review site launched in 2016 where customers can give their opinion on the service they received at the point of sale (Advisor Dealer), the product purchased (Advisor Product) or the salesman (Advisor Salesmen). At the end of 2022, more than 500,000 reviews have already been posted by Citro\u00ebn customers all over the world.\n\nInnovative approach to sustainable mobility\n\nIn 2022, Citro\u00ebn contributed to promoting electric mobility on the island of La Maddalena with the project \u201cCITRO\u00cbN DRIVE LA MADDALENA ELECTRIC\u201d. With this initiative, Citro\u00ebn delivered a fleet of nine all-electric vehicles to local authorities of the island, including two WallBox rechargers, and offered exclusive benefits reserved for its inhabitants for the purchase of electrified Citro\u00ebn vehicles.\n\nCitro\u00ebn wanted to make electrification and progress accessible to people on the island of La Maddalena, including public authorities. The daily use of these all-electric Citro\u00ebn vehicles by local authorities is an example of mobility for everyone, not only of those who live on the island but also for the many tourists who visit it every year.\n\nCitro\u00ebn Oli [all-\u00eb] concept car: radical, responsible and optimistic approach\n\nCitro\u00ebn Oli [all-\u00eb] is a striking conceptual manifesto of intelligent ideas challenging the status quo: a destination for versatile and enjoyable all-electric mobility to enhance the lives and lifestyles of all kinds of people. The target of Citro\u00ebn Oli is to achieve the \u2018best-in-class\u2019 Life Cycle Assessment by reducing weight and complexity, and using recycled and recyclable materials, for a better affordability, durability, and longevity.\n\nInspired by Citro\u00ebn Oli, Citro\u00ebn is deploying a new approach to property, services, and experiences for customers of electric vehicles.\nCitro\u00ebn AMI\nAn affordable and electric mobility solution that is accessible for all (with or without a driving license) is a success without borders, with already up to more than 30,000 orders. Marketed in 9 countries in Europe, in the United Kingdom and in Turkey for professional and individual customers. Environmentally friendly, the 100% electric AMI emits zero emissions when driving and means free access to increasingly restricted city centers.\n\nThe Jeep Brand held a global \u201c4xe\u201d day on September 8, 2022 to further communicate their commitments toward \u201cZero Electric Freedom\u201d. By 2025, there will be an electrified Jeep Brand vehicle available in every segment around the world and by 2030, Jeep Brand sales intend to reach 50% electric in the U.S. and 100% electric in Europe.\n\nEnvironmental and Social internal levers to limit the environmental and social impact of our communication materials\nStellantis has defined a set of environmental and social criteria that applies to its printed documents, point of sale advertising, stands and events. We are working hard towards applying these criteria worldwide.\n\nAs an example, in Europe, we aim at using the European Programme for Certified Forests (PEFC) or Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) paper for recurrent and unavoidable publications and print only the number of copies required. Our printers have \u201cImprim\u2019vert\u201d or \u201cImprim\u2019Lux\u201d certification which testifies that they sort and recycle all their printing waste and inks.\n\nIn France, we are a member of Citeo (recycling company mandated by the French Government): it means that our Citeo contribution is given to local authorities to support their paper sorting and collection systems.\n\nIn various regions of the world, our brands have either stopped printing most commercial and marketing documentation altogether for several years or have strongly shifted towards e-catalogs and documentation in 2021.\n\nResponsible events policy\nFor the 2022 Paris Motor Show, Stellantis applied the frame contract signed in 2017 with selected suppliers who are committed to reducing the environmental impact of their stands (choice of materials used, recycling and reuse); use wood which comes entirely from sustainably-managed forests and recycle 100% of the waste from the production/demolition of the stands (wood and other materials to be recycled separately); with reuse of the stand components parts for other shows (floors, partitions, screens, furniture, etc.).\n\nOur motor show strategy has strongly evolved recently:\n- many motor shows were cancelled since 2020 due to COVID-19 situation\n- many brands renewed their brand identity since 2020 leading automatically to a lower % of reuse with an additional creation/investment of new material\n- since the merger in 2021, Stellantis\u2019 motor show strategy has been revised to concentrate participation in less motor shows with strong ROI, reducing the total number of participation and initial % of re-use planned.\nJoint communication initiatives of brands\n\nStellantis brands consider organizing joint international press events when they have new models in common, e.g. Light Commercial Vehicles, to make better use of resources and to optimize media time and attendance. In June 2022, joint press test drives were organized for Peugeot e-EXPERT HYDROGEN, Citro\u00ebn \u00eb-JUMPY HYDROGEN and Opel VIVARO-e HYDROGEN in R\u00fcsselsheim and the Rhine-Main region (Germany).\n\nReasoned audiovisual productions\n\nStellantis has committed to using local in-house teams or hiring production teams in the country where the video or photo shoots take place, whenever possible. Local and regional photo and video shootings are also encouraged as standard. Responsible practices are also required through the production briefs issued by Stellantis or its brands to their agencies.\n\nStellantis maintains control over the distribution of its communication and uses the data responsively\n\nControlled Broadcasting of Advertisements\n\nStellantis and its brands control their communication broadcasting through processes in place and audience strategies, in partnership with their advertising and media agencies. The Stellantis Responsible Purchasing Guidelines, revised in 2022 include a clause requiring suppliers to comply with the laws and regulations in force in all countries in which they operate. These guidelines are used for all purchases made by Stellantis.\n\nAdvertising Formats\n\nWe prioritize digital advertising formats respecting user\u2019s comfort in accordance with the available reference sources, whether they be Coalition for Better Ads Standards, Digital Ad Trust or best practices encouraged within this field depending on the region we operate in. Our media agency adheres to Coalition for Better Ads Standards, hence actively encouraging our service and media providers to use these more often.\n\nVolume of Requests and Personal Data\n\nStellantis and its brands are careful to limit too numerous or inappropriate requests towards its audiences and make a proper use of personal data collected, through well-established standard processes and policies in line with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nAll U.S. brand eMail communications are designed to be CAN SPAM compliant, allowing customers to select the customer preference center where they can opt out of communications. Additionally, all customer data is stored in a secure environment that is monitored regularly.\n\nConsidering and Including all Audiences\n\nOur brands aim to add subtitling for main advertising campaigns whenever possible. Online material for U.S. websites and video content are designed to meet the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance standards.\nSignLive and Citro\u00ebn\n\nSince 2021, Citro\u00ebn UK has partnered with SignLive, the leading British Sign Language (BSL) online video interpreting service, to offer customers the ability to communicate with its entire 190 Citro\u00ebn retail and aftermarket network using British Sign Language (BSL).\n\nThere are 11 million deaf and hard of hearing people in the UK, and over 150,000 British Sign Language users \u2013 Citro\u00ebn is aware that English is not the only language for many of its customers. Citro\u00ebn UK pledges to enhance accessibility for the deaf community across its business as part of its \u201cThe French Car that Speaks your Language\u201d initiative, including across advertising.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Commitments from Partners\n\nStellantis Responsible Purchasing Guidelines revised in 2022 include environmental and social criteria as supplier selection and retention in the Stellantis Supplier panel is guided by Corporate and Social Responsibility (CSR) criteria.\n\nWaste management policy\n\nIn France, some of Stellantis brands are working with a supplier specialized in the production and design or stands and event spaces that implemented the ISO 2021 certification - an international standard for the responsible management of event activities, and is processing its wastes in a strict manner, in order to enter into a circular economy logic.\n\nThis supplier has thus equipped its two French sites with specific waste collection channels to sort out various materials after each event: wood, paper, cardboard, floor coverings and paint canisters.\n\nTransparency, Truthfulness and Accountability in Calls for Tenders\n\nWe strive to uphold the principles of transparency, truthfulness and accountability in calls for tenders. On top of this, our Code of Conduct, which can be accessed by all employees, includes a transparency, integrity and loyalty rule for relationships with suppliers and service providers.\n\nMore specifically, all Company employees must refrain from any anti-competitive practices.\n6 PROMOTING PROTECTION AND IMPLEMENTING RESPONSIBLE USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n6.1 WISE USE OF MATERIALS IN THE VEHICLE LIFE CYCLE (INCLUDING PRODUCT RECYCLING) 327\n   6.1.1 Context and Stellantis position 327\n   6.1.2 Forward-looking vision and targets 329\n   6.1.3 Identification and management of risks and opportunities 329\n   6.1.4 Governance and decision bodies to lead actions 332\n   6.1.5 Policies to execute the strategy 336\n   6.1.6 Organization and resources 340\n   6.1.7 Main initiatives, achievements and results 341\n   6.1.8 Detailed key performance indicators 354\n\n6.2 VEHICLE IMPACT ON AIR QUALITY 355\n   6.2.1 Context and Stellantis position 355\n   6.2.2 Forward-looking vision and targets 356\n   6.2.3 Identification and management of risks and opportunities 357\n   6.2.4 Governance and decision bodies to lead actions 360\n   6.2.5 Policies to execute the strategy 360\n   6.2.6 Organization and resources 360\n   6.2.7 Main initiatives, achievements and results 361\n\n6.3 INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT 362\n   6.3.1 Governance and decision bodies to lead actions 362\n   6.3.2 Policies to execute the strategy 364\n   6.3.3 Organization and resources 364\n\n6.4 OPTIMIZATION OF MATERIAL CYCLES IN MANUFACTURING PROCESSES (INCLUDING WASTE) 366\n   6.4.1 Context and Stellantis position 366\n   6.4.2 Forward-looking vision and targets 366\n   6.4.3 Identification and management of risks and opportunities 367\n   6.4.4 Main initiatives, achievements and results 369\n   6.4.5 Detailed key performance indicators 373\n\n6.5 CONTROL OF INDUSTRIAL DISCHARGES AND NUISANCES 375\n   6.5.1 Context and Stellantis position 375\n   6.5.2 Forward-looking vision and targets 375\n   6.5.3 Identification and management of risks and opportunities 376\n   6.5.4 Main initiatives, achievements and results 377\n   6.5.5 Detailed key performance indicators 380\n\n6.6 SUSTAINABLE WATER MANAGEMENT IN MANUFACTURING 382\n   6.6.1 Context and Stellantis position 382\n   6.6.2 Forward-looking vision and targets 382\n   6.6.3 Identification and management of risks and opportunities 383\n   6.6.4 Main initiatives, achievements and results 384\n   6.6.5 Detailed key performance indicators 389\n\n6.7 PROTECTION OF BIODIVERSITY 396\n   6.7.1 Context and Stellantis position 396\n   6.7.2 Forward-looking vision and targets 397\n   6.7.3 Identification and management of risks and opportunities 397\n   6.7.4 Main initiatives, achievements and results 399\n   6.7.5 Detailed key performance indicators 402\nSTELLANTIS\u2019 CSR MACRO-RISK/PILLAR V. PROMOTING PROTECTION AND IMPLEMENTING RESPONSIBLE USE OF NATURAL RESOURCE\n\nThe global economy is facing the challenges of increasing scarcity and an over-use of natural resources (water, minerals, raw materials, rare earths, etc.) combined with their geographical concentration. The United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals confirm the urge to find solutions both for the environment and political stability, which are key levers of sustainability for companies like Stellantis.\n\nIn this context of scarcity of natural resources, preserving them, including the quality of the air, a precious natural resource on which human health depends, and reducing our dependence on water and raw materials are both a question of environmental responsibility and of sustainability for businesses. Automakers need to rethink the materials adopted in mobility devices and their production processes.\n\nIn order to save resources while providing new sources of employment and of income, Stellantis is strengthening the sustainable and circular economy approach by creating a dedicated Circular Economy Business Unit: it is naturally part of the Care pillar as well as one of the seven accretive business announced during the Company\u2019s Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan in March 2022. The commitment to sustainability covers different activities such as conducting Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies on vehicles, deploying engineering research and development around new more sustainable materials, the recovery of parts and materials and improving manufacturing processes. Stellantis strives to improve the performance of our factories by reducing water consumption, managing the quantity and disposal of waste and other impacts generated by production, while integrating the need to protect the biodiversity of the surrounding areas. We design vehicles with the goal to reduce the environmental impact including when the vehicle has reached the end of its useful life.\n\n6.1 Wise use of materials in the vehicle life cycle (including product recycling)\n\n6.1.1 CONTEXT AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\nCSR issue/challenge #14: Wise use of materials in the vehicle life cycle (including product recycling)\n\nThe conditions of access to resources will become more complex in the decades to come. The world\u2019s population reached eight billion at the end of 2022 (World Population Prospects 2022: Summary of Results, with a high aspiration to consume more. The OECD estimates that by 2060 the average income might be equivalent to that of today\u2019s richest countries, which will induce a doubling of the use of raw materials to meet this growth, exerting ever more pressure on the environment. Recent geopolitical conditions also demonstrate the interdependence of countries on resources.\nStellantis is committed to change the consumption model and the way products are designed within a circular economy. The principle of a circular economy is embedded into Stellantis\u2019 business approach, focusing on extending the lifespan of products and reducing the use of natural resources starting from the production process, to the end of vehicle life, by reusing materials and returning waste and materials into the production loop. We are developing ways to increase the use of renewable and recycled materials for new vehicles and to extend the aftersales offer of reused, repaired and remanufactured parts with new product lines and in new regions. We are committed to processing end-of-life products and vehicles in a responsible manner including batteries from electrified vehicles.\n\nWe are working to overcome the use of hazardous substances targeted by regulations such as REACH. We are also working to find alternatives for the use of rare and precious resources which are often indispensable for nanotechnologies. In some cases, these materials are required for connected vehicles and technologies making them dependent on their availability.\n\n**Company\u2019s public position**\n\nStellantis promotes the repair of its products and, as such, develops a range of remanufactured spare parts and offers second-hand parts and a spare parts repair service. Through its action within a representative structure of automobile manufacturers such as, for example, the Association of European Automobile Manufacturers (ACEA) or the Automotive Industry Platform (PFA), it also supports the development of a harmonized methodology for measuring the rate of incorporation of recycled and natural materials.\n\nThe Company promotes the adoption of best practices by EU Member States to implement the EU Directive on the treatment of End-of-Life Vehicles (ELV). It advocates for a higher output (ELV pollution and dismantling parts, shredding, post-shredding, and recycling materials) of the recycling industry and its professionalization. By incorporating efficient processes to recover quality materials for new battery development, Stellantis is actively working on future solutions for end-of-life batteries and complying with responsible materials sourcing rules in the global battery value chain.\n\nStellantis, since 2020, along with 10 other Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), are jointly developing actions to voluntarily improve the social, ethical and environmental performance of automotive supply chains under the umbrella of the Drive Sustainability Initiative.\n\n> For more information refer to 7.1.1\n### 6.1.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\n| CSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE | VISION/AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | RESULTS |\n|----------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|---------|\n| Wise use of materials in the vehicle life cycle (including product recycling) | Wise use of materials in the vehicle life cycle (including product recycling) is innovative with eco-design and leverage end-of-life opportunities in a circular economy approach to reduce the use of natural resources and the environmental impact to the lowest possible level | Percentage of Green Materials (includes renewable and recycled content with lower carbon footprint materials) on total vehicle weight | Short-term: 2025: launch the first vehicles containing 25% of Green Materials | 2022: Application of green materials in vehicles launched in 2022 according to Stellantis roadmap for 2030 |\n|                      |                 | Availability of solutions to optimize High-Voltage Batteries lifespan and end-of-life through Repair, Remanufacturing, Second-life, Recycling | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan): 2030: launch the first vehicles containing 40% of Green Materials | 2021: Green Materials applied on vehicles in major regions |\n|                      |                 | 2025: at least one solution is implemented for each High-Voltage Battery sold in EU, NA, China | Long-term: 2050: continue to reinforce Green Materials content in the future vehicles | |\n|                      |                 | 2030: at least one solution is implemented for each High-Voltage Battery in all countries where EVs are sold | |\n|                      |                 | 2050: all solutions implemented in all countries where EVs are sold | |\n|                      |                 | Solutions implemented per Region: EE: 4; NA: 3; SA: 1; MEA: 1; IAP: 1; China: 1 | |\n|                      |                 | \u2022 E-Repair Services available in France, Germany, Israel, Japan and South Korea | |\n|                      |                 | \u2022 Increased Reman batteries types for BEV vehicles, including the Maserati EV platform | |\n|                      |                 | \u2022 Second-Life pilots in Enlarged Europe and North America | |\n|                      |                 | \u2022 Recycling process available in main EV sales countries | |\n\n### 6.1.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nThe automotive industry is facing a transformation that is impacting several aspects of its business: the materials used to build a vehicle are a key issue OEMs need to tackle. Stellantis has identified four types of risks in this area and implemented mitigation measures which open the way to opportunities of gaining competitive advantages or creating new businesses.\nRISK#1: SCARCITY OF CRITICAL MATERIALS\n\nThe availability of limited resources could generate scarcity of materials, included those critical. Stellantis defines the criticality of a material according to three criteria:\n\n- use criticality: materials where there are currently no alternatives, that are used for special features and which are important for competitiveness\n- supply criticality/potential scarcity: limited global quantity or unreliable supply chains\n- CSR criticality: the extraction or use of these materials is questionable from a CSR viewpoint such as environmental impact and breach of human rights.\n\nTransition to electrified vehicles is generating need for new raw materials such as lithium, nickel and cobalt. Demand for the materials needed for nanotechnologies is greater than ever. Rare earths show tensions in their market. Some stages of the polymers production process show a high concentration of among a small number of suppliers.\n\nIn order to mitigate the related impacts such as the increase in production costs, supply chain disruptions or delays and dependency following measures are implemented:\n\n- limit and reduce the use of critical materials;\n- identify and monitor materials considered as strategic;\n- develop alternative materials to substitute those critical materials;\n- sign contracts with critical material suppliers such as the lithium geothermal partners to secure supply contracts;\n- use LCA extensively to measure and reduce environmental impacts.\n\nIn addition, in order to address the challenges of accessing sustainable raw materials, Stellantis partners with the European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA). Stellantis participates in a working group oriented on rare earths for e-machine used for permanent magnets. The other working group will cover raw-materials for batteries.\n\nStellantis has launched several initiatives, which open technical and business opportunities:\n\n- develop a dual chemistry strategy based on two cobalt free batteries from 2024;\n- increase circular economy opportunities, using materials and designing components that are easier to recover and recycle at the end of their life, recycling materials that are becoming scarce and reusing them inside or outside the automotive sector;\n- reuse or remanufacture or repair parts to reduce demand;\n- use of Green Materials such as recycled or material of natural origin.\n\nRISK#2: INCREASED REGULATIONS ON HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES\n\nRegulatory requirements regarding the use of hazardous substances that can impact the environment together with the health and safety of customers and employees could increase in the future.\n\nIn order to mitigate the related impacts such as costs of potential non-compliance as well as cost and availability of substitute materials, following measures are implemented:\n\n- factor regulatory requirements regarding the use of hazardous substances into the phases of the vehicle life cycle;\n- reduce and eliminate hazardous substances such as limiting Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in the materials used and substituting some substances used as plasticizers or flame retardants that are targeted by regulations such as REACH;\n- monitor traceability of regulated substances contained in vehicle parts and materials, notably by working closely with suppliers to achieve compliance of vehicles and parts sold.\n\nStellantis has launched several initiatives, which open technical opportunities:\n\n- anticipate regulations by mastering impact of possible future changes;\n- improve cabin health and safety voluntarily introducing technical solutions such as filters for air flow.\nRISK#3: INCREASED REGULATION ON END-OF-LIFE PROCESSES\n\nChanges in end-of-life of vehicles (ELV) regulations could affect the dismantling and recycling sector by adding additional requirements to the Authorized Treatment Facilities (ATFs), increasing the responsibility of the OEMs to manage the entire end-of-life handling process. In some regions of the world such as the EU, South Korea and China, legislation requires producers to ensure recycling treatment at the end-of-life of High-Voltage Batteries (HVB).\n\nThe EU has initiated a review process which will increase producer\u2019s obligations and generate the likely risk of surcharges. Under current Market conditions, the value of reused and recycled materials recovered from an ELV covers all cost of related activities like collection, depollution and dismantling as well as treatment of remaining material streams.\n\nImpacts resulting from the combination of cost increase and reduced revenues can be explained by the increase of producer\u2019s obligations in the global ELV process. This trend is reinforced by the HVB end-of-life treatment.\n\nIn order to mitigate these impacts, following measures are implemented:\n\n- use materials and design components that are compatible with the circular economy process, including the need to recover and recycle end-of-life vehicles;\n- deploy responsible process of end-of-life products specifically the vehicles and batteries from electrified vehicles;\n- work with stakeholders and authorities to define optimized ELV management structure.\n\nStellantis has launched several initiatives, which open technical and business opportunities:\n\n- develop a Circular Economy Business Unit to offer customers the option of reused parts coming from ELVs, generating additional revenues and economic balance of the process with new opportunities of savings thanks to materials recycling activities;\n- participate in or acquire innovative startups such as Amanh\u00e3 Global;\n- reduce the variety of plastics to facilitate sorting after shredding and improve profitability;\n- use a single family of plastics per core function so that an entire sub-assembly can be recycled without dismantling;\n- mark plastic parts with standardized codes for identification, sorting and traceability;\n- introduce green materials (recycled) into vehicle design to support the development of recycling opportunities.\n\nSpecific impacts of upcoming regulations notably in EU and China might lead to increase the producers\u2019 obligations and generate the likely risk of additional costs. To mitigate this risk, Stellantis is implementing measures to reduce logistics costs, extend the HVB lifespan before recycling through repair and remanufacturing or repurpose the HVB or its components for energy storage outside of the automotive sector with possible revenue generation.\n\nRISK#4: LOW ENVIRONMENTAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS RESPECT IN SUPPLY CHAIN DURING EXTRACTION PHASE OF SOME MINERALS\n\nSome raw materials or minerals could come from a region of the world where environmental and social regulations are not aligned with the Company\u2019s values and standards or where conflicts are open (tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold - also known as 3TG - are \u201cconflict minerals\u201d for which the mining can provide a source of funding for war).\n\nCompanies are working to meet growing expectations of stakeholders (including shareholders, employees, customers and NGOs) to take responsibility for their supplier\u2019s environmental and social practices.\n\nIn order to mitigate the related reputational or financial impacts in case of litigations, following measures are implemented:\n\n- implement a due diligence process which strives to use, as much as possible, materials from responsible supply chains respecting human rights and the environment;\n- introduce a traceability system for supplies that contain conflict minerals; Stellantis pays particular attention to the materials used in batteries for electrified vehicles through the supply chain and supports initiatives for innovative supplies of raw materials;\n- develop partnerships such as the European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA).\nNANOTECHNOLOGIES IN THE AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR\n\nNanotechnologies are a relevant illustration of the combination of those risks while demand for the materials they require is greater than ever in the context of the increased appetite for connected objects. This trend also affects the automotive industry. Metals used to support nanotechnologies experience market tensions and are increasingly harder to mine: the metal content of the ore is decreasing, while mines currently operated show lower concentrations which implies more and more processing. Stellantis is focused on limiting and reducing the use of these metals and increasing the recovery during the recycling phase.\n\n6.1.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nA materials strategy monitored at Strategy Council level\n\nThe Global Purchasing and Supply Chain EVP and the Engineering EVP, both direct reports to the CEO, and members of the Top Executive Team and the Strategy Council are responsible for the materials strategy. Mapping of material risks for both current and forecasts, is performed according to specific criteria for each raw material.\n\nSome of the criteria include:\n\n- significant contribution to develop existing technologies;\n- scarcity and geographic location;\n- social and environmental impacts including recyclability and extraction or production conditions;\n- geopolitical or logistic accessibility;\n- cost and share of Stellantis needs compared to global market demand and market players.\n\nBased on this risk mapping, the EVPs validate the R&D roadmap on substitute materials or alternative supplies, to manage and secure the Company\u2019s sourcing over the long-term, notably through collaborative actions with metallurgy and mining industries.\n\nThe finance department performs cost monitoring on materials in connection with operational purchasing plus research and development teams. Their goal is to anticipate and manage cost developments, help diversify and monitor the most strategic supplies. In the context of increasing scarcity and costs of raw materials on the long-term, the supplier relationship is a lever to implement the Company material and product development policies. Stellantis focuses its efforts on the materials used in batteries for electrified vehicles through the supply chain and supports initiatives for innovative sourcing of raw materials.\n\n> For more information refer to 7.1.3\nA Circular Economy Business Unit\n\nIn order to further master the wise use of materials in the vehicle life cycle and reduce the environmental impact in terms of carbon footprint, Stellantis has created a Business Unit dedicated to circular economy. As one of the seven accretive Business Units outlined in Stellantis March 2022 Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, its aim is to build a sustainable and profitable business based on circular economy principles investigating and expanding opportunities in various areas such as the use of plant surplus (excess of parts and materials from factories), parts remanufacturing, repairing, reusing, end-of-life vehicle management and recycled materials in a closed-loop process.\n\nThroughout the full vehicle life cycle we have developed a comprehensive 360-degree business based on the 4R Strategy: reman, repair, reuse and recycle in order to extend products (vehicles and High-Voltage Batteries (HVB)) lifespan and reduce waste by returning into the material loop.\n\n- **Reman**: used, worn and defective parts are recovered, dismantled, cleaned and remanufactured to OEM specifications, same performance and warranty as original parts\n- **Repair**: worn parts removed from a customer\u2019s vehicle, repaired and returned to be refitted to the same vehicle (for example electronic parts, gearboxes and traction batteries)\n- **Reuse**: original multi-brand parts in good condition recovered from end-of-life vehicles and reused as-is to be fitted to other vehicles. Life extension includes projects to repurpose for reuse High-Voltage Batteries in non-automotive business\n- **Recycle**: recycled materials from production, maintenance scraps and end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) fed back into the manufacturing process of new vehicles and aftersales products. This reduces the carbon emission to produce parts from scratch while minimizing the risk of raw material scarcity and the material cost fluctuation impact.\n\nTo promote the 4R strategy and embrace all the Company\u2019s initiatives in terms of circular economy during the vehicle life cycle, (from design to production of new vehicles, to the use of vehicles until the end of vehicle life and recycling) through one recognizable identity, the Stellantis Circular Economy Business Unit launched the new label \u201cSUSTAINera - circular economy - Making a better future\u201d: it embodies the Stellantis core value \u201cWe care for the future\u201d through a responsible business entering a new era of sustainability.\n\nFor more details on Second-Life refer to 6.1.7.7\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\nStellantis Fosters Circular Economy Ambitions with Dedicated Business Unit to Power New Era of Sustainable Manufacturing and Consumption\n\nhttps://www.stellantis.com/en/news/press-releases/2022/october/stellantis-fosters-circular-economy-ambitions-with-dedicated-business-unit-to-power-new-era-of-sustainable-manufacturing-and-consumption\nSUSTAINera:\n\n- represents the dedicated circular economy product lines and services as part of the 360\u00b0 parts and services offer and promises sustainable, transparent and affordable products and services to our customers for all brands of vehicles without compromising quality while preserving the environment through decreased waste and less use of our planet\u2019s resources.\n\n- aims to support marketing and communication actions worldwide, replacing the former parts and services designations of Ex-FCA Reman in North America, ex-FCA Regen in Europe and Renew for ex-PSA product lines.\n\n- is the label for remanufacturing, repair, reuse and recycling activities and products as well as for factories or manufacturing units acting for the circular economy in Stellantis, like the first Circular Economy Hub announced in the Mirafiori complex, starting with three activities: parts remanufacturing, vehicle reconditioning and vehicle dismantling, with the scope set to expand further activities and globally.\n\nSUSTAINera brings the opportunity to reduce the carbon footprint and raw material consumption (Life Cycle Assessment analysis performed according to a methodology approved by an external independent company, Sphera, shows on average up to 80% of raw material savings and up to 50% of non-emitted CO\u2082 for remanufactured and repaired parts corresponding to the best-seller of similar products in Europe when compared to new parts) driving Circular Economy Business Unit to play a key role in the carbon net zero achievement by 2038.\n\nThe Circular Economy Business Unit roadmap includes participation in innovative startups: a participation was signed with Amanh\u00e3 Global in 2020 who provides B-Parts e-commerce platform focused on multibrand original used automotive parts with over five million parts available in inventory. B-parts delivers its products in more than 155 countries.\n\nIn 2022, a strategic partnership led by the Circular Economy Business Unit in collaboration with Commercial Vehicle Business Unit, was signed by Stellantis N.V. and Qinomic, a high-tech company specialized in innovative and sustainable solutions for mobility, to create a proof of concept to convert internal combustion engine light commercial vehicles to electric drivetrain. Successful completion of this joint development in 2023 and positive customer feedback on the demo cars\u2019 performance will lead to implementation and commercialization starting in France in 2024.\n\nThe Circular Economy Business Unit is run by the Senior Vice President Global Circular Economy and reports into the Executive Vice President for Affiliates on the Board of Directors.\nSUSTAINera is the new label launched by the Circular Economy Business Unit. It is the recognizable identity to promote the 4R strategy and embrace all the Company\u2019s initiatives in terms of circular economy throughout the full vehicle life cycle.\nPre-owned vehicles activity\n\nStellantis has decided to dedicate a specific Business Unit to pre-owned vehicles (PROV), with a worldwide scope, leveraging its experience as an OEM but also a global ecosystem including companies such as Aramis Group or Autobiz. PROV Business Unit is responsible for defining pre-owned activities strategy, targets, key projects, business guidelines and for supporting all regional entities. It has central oversight and accountability for pre-owned activities global financial results.\n\nRegarding companies dedicated to this business, PROV Business Unit ensures strategic oversight and consistency through Board participation, in line with corporate governance rules, and provides them with the adequate support through synergies with Stellantis activities. PROV Business Unit continuously looks for additional opportunities to develop new business, including through partnerships with innovative start-ups, for example, Autoavaliar, Brazil or Fengche, China.\n\nAll Stellantis pre-owned vehicle activities aim to operate in compliance both with applicable regulations and Stellantis policies enforcing best practices regarding safety at work (including in our reconditioning facilities), competition laws, diversity, respect for customer data privacy protection and customer information, which is paramount to present our offers both digitally and on physical sites.\n\n6.1.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nStellantis considers materials impact at all stages of the life cycle starting from the product definition through the design phase. The materials and circular economy policy is based on the following principles:\n\n1. Eco-design to boost innovation and contribute to reduce material consumption and environmental impact of materials.\n2. An assertive commitment to use green materials.\n3. A commitment to reduce hazardous substances.\n4. A commitment to responsible recyclability - as a prevention measure against material scarcity and environmental impact of raw material sourcing - and to a responsible end-of-life treatment.\n5. A commitment to provide customers with offers in the circular economy mindset: sustainable parts and service offers to increase the lifespan of their vehicle and its parts, including High-Voltage Batteries.\n\n1. Eco-design to boost innovation and reduce material consumption and environmental impact of materials\n\nFrom the vehicle design through each stage of the vehicle life cycle, Stellantis works to limit the vehicle\u2019s environmental footprint in line with applicable regulations by:\n\n- improving fuel consumption\n- reducing CO\u2082 emissions and pollutants\n- using natural resources responsibly\n- improving recyclability, repairability and remanufacturability.\n\nIn addition to supporting vehicle compliance with environmental legislation, eco-design also helps the Company stay competitive regarding sustainable mobility and new materials.\n### LIFE CYCLE STAGES\n\n| LIFE CYCLE STAGES | CORE CHALLENGES |\n|-------------------|------------------|\n| Product definition | Define new automotive products and services taking into account the mobility needs of consumers around the world, local legislation and people\u2019s expectations regarding the environment and safety. |\n| Design and engineering | Design vehicles to reduce their impact:  \n  - on the environment: CO\u2082 emissions, local pollutants, the use of resources and recyclability;  \n  - on society: road safety, noise pollution, traffic congestion. |\n| Production | Reduce the environmental impact of automobile manufacturing.  \n  Improve workplace safety.  \n  Participate in the economic and social life of local communities. |\n| Transport and sale | Integrate environmental challenges into supply chain and dealership network management.  \n  Inform customers in a responsible manner through advertising and labelling and provide a satisfying ownership experience with effective sales and customer service processes. |\n| Use | Help limit the impact associated with vehicle use: promote safe and environment friendly driving practices, reduce vehicle fuel consumption, and develop increasingly effective exhaust emission control systems.  \n  Promote the use of parts from circular economy in vehicle maintenance and repair. |\n| End-of-life | Facilitate the collection and processing of end-of-life vehicles and components by specialized providers and optimize their recyclability (pollution control, recycling, recovery and reuse). Evaluate the business opportunities to create circular economy offers to our customers and optimize the effort to collect and treat end-of-life vehicles and in particular the HVBs. |\n\nIn order to be a strong participant in the circular economy market, the Company is developing internal procedures and partnerships with industrial counterparts from the automotive industry and other sectors. This is helping to reduce the pressure on natural resources for the different stages of the life cycle of our vehicles.\n\nThe Company is implementing a life cycle analysis procedure to evaluate and validate the selection of materials in new projects. This action allows to improve the use of natural resources and to limit the impact of products on the environment throughout their useful life. Each stage of the life cycle and the main environmental issues are examined.\n\nThis policy to search for new materials is being implemented in conjunction with the Company\u2019s commitment to using more renewable, recycled or bio-sourced materials in its vehicles.\n\n**Spare parts verified to boost safety, environmental protection and compliance**\n\nStellantis pays close attention to the selection of material to comply with regulations, notably those related to safety. Due to their strong visual resemblance to branded parts, customers might be misled by counterfeit parts. A poor quality of counterfeit parts can endanger consumer safety. In the automotive field in particular, counterfeit products do not offer guarantees in terms of safety, environmental protection or regulatory requirements. In order to allow customers, after-market and custom networks to identify genuine parts, the various brands of Stellantis use a secure label placed on replacement parts packaging.\n\n> For more information refer to 6.1.7\n2. An assertive commitment to use green materials\n\nStellantis is involved in the integration of recycled and natural materials in the Company\u2019s vehicles. The integration of recycled materials covers all materials used in vehicles. Green materials used in the vehicles can be defined in three categories:\n\n- recycled materials;\n- materials of natural origin such as, wood and plant fibers;\n- bio-sourced materials such as, polymers that come from renewable resources rather than the petrochemical industry.\n\nThere are several advantages to using them including reduced use of mined and fossil-based materials and fostering the development of the recycling industries by increasing demand. Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) are conducted to check and highlight the environmental progress of new green material solutions.\n\n3. A commitment to reduce hazardous substances\n\nStellantis focuses its attention on the environment and the health and safety of their customers and employees.\n\nRegarding hazardous substance management, the main drivers are:\n\n- the elimination of four heavy metals; lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium which are regulated in Europe by the Directive No 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles and its Annex II exemptions list and by similar legislations in other regions of the world such as Korean ELV, Enforcement Decree of the Act on Resource Circulation of Electrical and Electronic Equipment and Vehicles\n- the compliance with the different substances legislations applicable all over the world such as EU POP and REACH regulation, TSCA Section 5 (a) Significant New Use Rules (SNURs), China Requirements for Prohibited Substances on Automobiles (GB/T 30512-2014). The Company has set up an organization and communication system to monitor its partners and suppliers using the automotive industry guidelines\n- the introduction of technical solutions to improve vehicle interior air quality to support customer health, safety and comfort in the cabin, in addition to regulatory requirements.\n\n4a. A commitment to responsible recyclability, as a prevention measure against material scarcity and environmental impact of raw material sourcing, to support a responsible End-of-life treatment\n\nThe impact of recycling end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) is taken into account starting from the design phase. Vehicle materials are selected according to increasingly strict criteria that are designed to foster the development of recovery and recycling facilities. To ensure that its vehicles are highly recyclable, Stellantis is committed to:\n\n- using materials that are easy to recycle\n- reducing the variety of plastics to facilitate sorting after shredding, optimize the related recovery processes and improve profitability\n\u25a0 using a single family of plastics per core function so that an entire sub-assembly can be recycled without full breakdown dismantling\n\u25a0 marking plastic parts with standardized codes for identification, sorting and traceability\n\u25a0 introducing green materials, especially recycled materials, into vehicle design to support the emergence or development of new markets for certain materials\n\u25a0 integrating recycling considerations upstream in the innovation phases with a focus on new materials or vehicle parts.\n\nAs a participant in the International Dismantling Information System (IDIS) project, Stellantis provides recycling facilities with disassembly instructions for our vehicle brands, including disassembly information for HVBs.\n\nStellantis is performing vehicle recycling studies to support vehicle end-of-life research and development and to satisfy dismantling requirements for ELVs.\n\n4b. A commitment to responsible End-of-life treatment\n\nAs part of the Circular Economy Business Unit, one central ELV team integrates ELV activities for Stellantis brands. This allows synergies to be increased by:\n\u25a0 exchanging information with authorities at regional and country levels\n\u25a0 streamlining Stellantis ELV activities in countries in Europe and in regions outside of Europe\n\u25a0 negotiating with Stellantis partners in the full ELV chain at central and local levels\n\u25a0 contributing to the work by automobile associations at country, European and global levels\n\u25a0 analyzing and generating new business and revenue opportunities.\n\n5. A commitment to provide customers with offers in the circular economy mindset\n\n\u25a0 Stellantis is using all its expertise in 4R (Reman, Reuse, Repair, Recycle) to offer to its customers a sustainable alternative to genuine new parts extending the lifespan of products (parts and HVB).\n\nThe Company is permanently screening new suppliers offering new technologies to bring new range of sustainable parts to the market as early as possible.\n\nSUSTAINera, the dedicated circular economy aftermarket offer, promises sustainable, transparent and affordable products and services to our customers for all brands of vehicles without compromising quality while preserving the environment through decreased waste and less use of our planet\u2019s resources. The benefits for the customers are economical (savings up to 70% of new part price further than the opportunity to maintain the re-sell value of the vehicle) and ecological, satisfying their willingness to purchase responsibly.\nSUSTAINera offers:\n\n- remanufactured parts helping to reduce the cost of vehicle ownership, decrease the volume of materials heading to landfills and lower energy consumption. The Company certifies the production of remanufactured parts, manufactured internally or through specialized providers, in order to provide a repair solution that is equivalent to original equipment parts and provides the same warranty conditions as new\n- repair & return service through our Repairer network\n- reused parts through a multibrand original reused parts e-commerce platform (B-Parts) with one year warranty\n- parts recycling service: on specific components (e.g. HVB, catalytic converters) Stellantis offers collection and recycling conformed with highest standards and, when it makes sense technically and economically, makes sure recovered materials are reused in the automotive industry.\n\nStellantis Pre-owned vehicles policy: Stellantis pre-owned vehicles activity echoes directly the Company mission, \u201cpowered by our diversity, we lead the way the world moves\u201d, focusing on proposing safe, clean and affordable mobility solutions to our customers. Our pre-owned vehicles are mainly recent, certified to meet quality standard, and more affordable than brand new models. In addition, providing used vehicles participate in a growing circular model helping to preserve natural resources needed to build a car.\n\n6.1.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nEco-design product development organization\n\nIntegrated in the Materials & Sustainability Engineering Department, teams are dedicated to develop and monitor sustainable eco-design worldwide. The mission is to implement eco-design process in accordance with the different Stellantis commitments:\n\n- monitor and reduce the use of hazardous substances\n- increase the use of green materials\n- implement recyclable solutions\n- evaluate the environmental footprint of new solutions and complete vehicles thanks to Life Cycle Assessments\n- monitor dedicated KPIs, performance and conduct research.\n\nIn order to conduct these actions, standards and tools are defined and implemented to monitor design criteria applied by engineering teams. In particular, standards are defined to limit and trace the use of hazardous substances or to specify the green material content. For instance, materials specifications are defined for major plastic parts to integrate minimum of Green Materials content. IMDS is mainly used to monitor material composition of the parts including hazardous substances identification.\nCircular Economy Business Unit\n\nStellantis has a Business Unit dedicated to the circular economy to build a sustainable business based on circular economy principles.\n\nIn 2022 the first phase of training on circular economy activities, impact and line to Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan was rolled out. Other learning initiatives, such as Climate School, underline the Company purpose to raise employees' awareness and commitment to sustainability.\n\nThe Business Unit uses common resources from central or regional teams including engineering, quality, purchasing or manufacturing, after-sales, suppliers and other providers. Amanh\u00e3 Global, a subsidiary of Stellantis, has its own resources to support its growth plan.\n\nThe size of the team is growing significantly to support circular economy strategy and business growth.\n\nHigh-Voltage Batteries (HVB) Management\n\nThe Company is implementing collection and treatment procedures for its High-Voltage Batteries (HVB) used in hybrid and electric vehicles sold in Europe and other regions. Stellantis offers longer lifespan mobility to their customers by developing repair and remanufacturing processes. Stellantis is also targeting to extend the battery lifespan through Second-life solutions outside of the automotive sector for energy storage including those through its joint Venture with NHOA (ex Engie EPS) Free2move eSolution. Stellantis is responsible for the recycling of its HVBs and contracts with specific operators selected to collect and recycle HVBs from our plants, research and development sites, dealer network and end-of-life vehicles according to existing local regulations. The battery technology in electric and hybrid vehicles requires specific handling methods.\n\nIn order to support BEV customers, Stellantis can provide them a State of Health (SoH) document that describes the current status of the degradation of the battery as an indicative information. The document also provides recommendations on how to optimize battery life and range.\n\n6.1.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\n6.1.7.1 Main initiatives to support Eco-design and reduce material consumption: the LCA approach\n\nStellantis conducts Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) on its vehicles and components. These studies analyze the multi-criteria environmental footprint of a vehicle, its components and materials design. The entire product life cycle is taken into account from raw material extraction to manufacture, use and end-of-life. The methodology used for LCAs refers to ISO standards 14040/44 and critical reviews are conducted with external experts. The last critical review focused on battery electric vehicle DS3 Crossback e-tense performed by a third-party reviewer panel.\nThe results of life cycle assessments help to improve the vehicles\u2019 environmental record:\n\n- highlighting the environmental advantage of one innovative solution compared to another, and more broadly, the overall environmental impact of a product;\n- identifying possible pollution transfers from one phase of the life cycle to another;\n- highlighting core environmental impacts;\n- choosing more environmentally friendly technologies and materials.\n\nMain Indicators of Environmental Impacts Monitored by Stellantis\n\n| IMPACT ON AIR | Global warming potential in kg CO\u2082-eq: characterizes the average increase in greenhouse gases emissions that contribute to global warming (CO\u2082, CH\u2084, N\u2082O, etc.). |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|               | Acidification potential in kg SO\u2082-eq: characterizes the increase in the content of acidifying substances that cause acid rain and decay of some forests (SO\u2082, etc.). |\n|               | Photochemical ozone creation potential in kg ethene eq.: characterizes the phenomena leading to the formation of ozone which have harmful effects on human health and on ecosystems (VOCs, etc.). |\n\n| IMPACT ON WATER | Eutrophication potential in kg phosphate eq.: characterizes the introduction of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate compounds that promote the growth of certain algae (NO\u2083, etc.). |\n\n| IMPACT ON NATURAL RESOURCES | Potential for the depletion of natural mineral resources in kg antimony eq.

The analyses are usually conducted at the end of product design and include recyclability and critical materials. LCA results can also be used in the planning of future vehicles.\n\nFormer PSA was a founding member of the EcoSD network, an association whose main purpose is to foster interaction between researchers and industry players to create and disseminate Eco-Sustainable Design (EcoSD) expertise in France and beyond, thereby promoting France\u2019s EcoSD expertise internationally. The Company participates in collaborative projects with industry and laboratory members of the network, with the support of the French Agency for Ecological Transition (ADEME). Achievements of these projects include:\n\n- an assessment of the methodology used to measure the \u201cwater footprint\u201d of an entire vehicle\n- the creation of a tool which takes environmental criteria into account in the design of traction batteries for electric vehicles\n- the development of a guide with good practices for LCA practitioners on using mineral depletion indicators and on taking into account material criticality issues\nthe publication of a \u201cWhite Book\u201d with edition of Presses des Mines, on the application of monetarization in LCA for eco-design purposes\n\nan assessment of the environmental profile of the data in the context of connected vehicles\n\nan assessment of the environmental profile of charging infrastructures for BEVs in the context of long-distance drive.\n\nIn addition, STELLANTIS participates to different partnerships:\n\n- OSCAR, a project funded by National French Research Association (ANR) and launched in 2019, develops a new approach to eco-design for complex systems (battery, innovative powertrain, etc.). It allows, through a wide exploration in the upstream phases of a design project, to identify optimal solutions with sustainable development by optimizing environmental, technical and attractive performance.\n\n- CarE-Service, a project funded by the European Commission whose object is the valorisation of the material flows deriving from the end-of-life Vehicles (ELV) management of electric and hybrid vehicles with a circular economy approach and with particular focus on metals, technopolymers and batteries.\n\n- IRIS Initiative which is a collaborative initiative coordinated by Carbone 4, focusing on strategic foresight and scenario planning, that brings together 15 major companies from various sectors, as well as research institutions. The objective is to build shared and rigorous tools (foresight scenarios) and methods that aims at enabling companies to design \u201cphysically\u201d realistic transition pathways and to collectively anticipate the disruptions induced by planetary boundaries issues (resources, climate).\n\nPh.D. thesis work has been also conducted in France, focused on the development of a method to optimize environmental impacts of automotive product and service systems such as carsharing. Another Ph.D. candidate began work in 2020 regarding the development of a method for implementing CSR KPIs in the design phase of vehicles. In South America region, a Doctorate level study intends to develop a model for the application of the LCA for vehicles to reinterpret the environmental gains brought by Route 2030 in a cradle to grave perspective, going beyond the use stage and carbon emissions.\n\nThe Company aims to implement life cycle assessments on new vehicles. For core technological changes or strategic innovations, studies are conducted to assess developments of the environmental impact from these technologies.\nExamples of the application of LCAs\n\nThese analyses are carried out using software linked to environmental databases that makes it possible to calculate a product\u2019s environmental impact. The goal is to compare the environmental impact from a new model compared to the previous generation. The impact of new electrified powertrain is also evaluated. Examples of vehicles that have been assessed during the past year:\n\n- Alfa Romeo Tonale diesel and MHEV\n- Dodge Hornet gasoline\n- DS4 gasoline and eTense\n- Fiat 500 gasoline, MHEV and electric\n- Fiat Fastback flex fuel\n6.1.7.2 Main initiatives to boost the integration of green materials\n\nStellantis plans to integrate a green materials monitoring system focused on recycled and natural materials in new vehicles. We are focusing on recycled polymers as an important part of the circular economy and increasing our research efforts. The wider application of green materials requires the development of robust supply chains and more research on new materials. To meet its targets, the Company is actively selecting and certifying materials that offer the best cost and technical application, thereby creating a portfolio of solutions for future vehicle projects. The use of green materials will continue to be included in the engineering design guidelines and in the specifications for supplying parts and components. The use of green materials is also one of the selection criteria when choosing suppliers.\nStellantis is involved in a large number of scientific partnerships to boost the development of the green materials industry and expand the use of these materials in vehicles. In 2022 Stellantis participated in:\n\n- **RUSTINE project**: extruded recycling for the recovery of polymer waste sponsored by Fonds Unique Interminist\u00e9riel (FUI) with industrial and academic partners (Galloo Plastics, Wipak, Nutripack, Umet and Armines). The objective is to develop a process for decontaminating plastic waste from different sectors, in particular automobile. Stellantis aims to develop validated products with recycled polyolefin materials for interior parts without losing the properties of virgin materials, in particular odor and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs).\n\n- **FOREST-COMP project**: supported by Italian Research Ministry has studied combination of bio-based polymeric matrices and reinforcement with functionalized natural fibres to develop a large variety of green plastic with a wide range of thermo-mechanical and surface properties which make them flexible for different applications. A particular focus has been addressed to bio-PET and bio-PUR for interior trimming applications (carpets, roof panel, door panel) and acoustic insulation.\n\n- **REINVENT project**: supported by European Commission has developed and combined bio based materials and fibres for replacing the petroleum based polyurethane insulation products used vehicles interior foamed products like layers for car ceilings, dashboards and seat covers.\n\n- **NOVUM project**: supported by European Commission, aimed at validation of new injection molding process with new bio-based materials made of cellulose with materials properties as: i) material strength / mechanical properties at the same level or better than commercial (PLA and wood composite) references; ii) higher cellulose content (total cellulose content 50-60%); iii) 100% renewable resources.\n\n- **RECIPLAST**: a project funded by the Piedmont Region as part of the Bioeconomy Platform whose focus is to improve the eco-sustainability of plastic used in the packaging and automotive sectors, through the development of processes of separation, recycling and enhancement of those fractions of post-consumer and industrial waste that today present critical issues in their capacity of recyclability and reuse.\n\n- **ASR project**: Supported by U.S. Council on Automotive Research (USCAR) aimed at validating the recycling of Automotive Shredder Residues (ASR) by Chemical Recycling into usable polyester resins targeted for interior trim and second surface support applications.\n\nThe latest vehicles brought to the market illustrate the results obtained on the inclusion of materials that are recycled or from natural sources. The following examples show the diversity of applications validated on the last vehicles from the different brands in the main regions of commercialization:\n\nIn Enlarged Europe:\n\n- **Jeep Renegade** (Upland Special Edition) in the interior trims of the dashboard has adopted recycled PC/ABS and an extensive use of textiles based on recycle PET is done.\n\n- **Maserati Grecale** in the tufted floor carpets uses recycled polyamide derived from disused fish nets recovered in the sea.\n\u25a0 **Peugeot 408** integrates 100% of post-consumer P/E-I in the Mudguard components and a combination of 95% post-consumer and 5% post-industry polypropylene in the bumper.\n\nIn North America:\n\n\u25a0 **Jeep Wrangler** uses glass-filled recycled nylon materials for mirror support brackets in Jeep Wrangler \"doors off\" model.\n\n\u25a0 **Jeep Grand Cherokee** uses recycled polycarbonate in foglamp lenses and low-emission acetal (POM) materials for glovebox door dampers.\n\n\u25a0 **3.5L Engines** use recycled content post-consumer glass/mineral nylon for intake manifolds.\n\n\u25a0 New vehicles to integrate **100% post consumer recycled PET** used in fabrics for anti-squeak performance in seating.\n\nIn South America:\n\n\u25a0 **Fiat Fastback** extended the use of polypropylene and wood fibers composite materials to cargo load floor in the trunk.\n\n\u25a0 **Citro\u00ebn C3** achieved a historic result for the region with a high mass of green materials applied in eleven different applications, with emphasis on applications in recycled polypropylene.\n\n### 6.1.7.3 Main initiatives to reduce hazardous substances\n\n**Regulatory requirements** regarding the use of hazardous substances are factored into the phases of the vehicle life cycle. We work closely with suppliers on achieving compliance of vehicles and parts sold. To ensure the traceability of regulated substances contained in vehicle parts and materials, the Company collects information from suppliers using the automotive standard International Material Data System (IMDS) tool according to the Global Automotive Declarable Substance List (GADSL).\n\nStellantis has set the goal of minimizing the use of substances of concern by working upstream during the new material research and innovation phases which means in Europe for example considering REACH Candidate list and anticipating the future restrictions introduced by REACH Annexes XIV, XVII and by Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP) regulation. Examples include the replacement of diethylhexyl phtalate (DEHP) which is used as a plasticizer in PVC sheaths for wiring harnesses. Other regulations on chemical substances such as Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP) and Biocides which affect part design and production are also monitored for compliance.\n\n**Concerning Vehicle interior air quality**, in addition to comply with legal regulations Stellantis has introduced technical solutions to support customer health, safety and comfort in the cabin. These include filters for air flow into the passenger compartment and limits on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the materials used inside the cabin. Where applicable, the air in the passenger compartment is checked for VOCs and odors before the vehicle goes to the market. Stellantis is working on new developments accounting for specific material characteristics, surface treatments and with antimicrobial properties e.g., in FIAT 500 Red Edition as well as filters to improve the quality of the interior air, limiting also the development of micro-organisms.\n6.1.7.4 Main initiatives to improve responsible recyclability and to support end-of-life treatment\n\nStellantis implements actions from the ecodesign stage to the end-of-Life of its vehicles\n\nThrough its choice of materials, Stellantis aims to promote the recyclability of its products, to obtain the homologation of its vehicles where regulatory relevant, the success of their sales and their effective recycling at the end of their life.\n\nOne of our actions in this field fall within the framework of European Directive No. 2000/53/EC of September 18, 2000 regarding end-of-life vehicles (ELV) which sets vehicle design requirements and operational processing requirements for the vehicle at the end of its service life.\n\n- From the design stage, **recyclability is taken into account**. Stellantis has implemented the processes needed to fulfill the 95% recovery requirement in vehicle weight, and 85% reusing or recycling materials with traceability processes for information on the weight of materials, substances and the corresponding assessments and analyses. In accordance with EU Directive 2005/64/CE, audits are conducted by a third-party regarding the traceability processes for information on the weight of materials, substances and the corresponding assessments and analyses.\n\n- At the end-of-life, Stellantis implements three types of recovery for end-of-life vehicles: reuse of parts, recycling of materials and energy recovery. Since 2015, vehicles in Europe have to be 95% recovered and 85% recycled or recyclable.\n\nIn order to meet its obligations, the Company has an internal horizontal network, that provides the framework to manage the upstream and downstream processes. The two activities include: upstream, which seeks eco-design solutions, and downstream, which involves services for the collection and treatment of end-of-life vehicles. This work is conducted in close collaboration with Company partners such as suppliers, recycling operators and vehicle manufacturer associations.\n\n6.1.7.5 Main initiatives, achievements and results on parts recycling\n\nStellantis recycling activity is currently available in four regions: Enlarged Europe, North and South America, Middle East and Africa.\n\nIn 2022, more than 1.7 million parts have been recycled including catalytic converters, fascias/plastic bumpers, alloy wheels, High-Voltage Batteries.\n\n6.1.7.6 Main initiatives to improve end-of-life vehicle (ELV) treatment\n\nIn 2000, the EU End-of-Life Vehicle Directive began requiring all vehicle manufacturers and importers to take back vehicles from the last owners or holders when the cars have reached end-of-life. For that purpose and by following the different national requirements, **the two former companies (FCA and PSA) have built take-back networks in EU member states** where they were operating. The systems vary in different countries between implementation and maintenance by the manufacturers themselves, assigning a service provider on their behalf or participating in a collective take-back process, where required by law.\nIn France, we implemented an Individual System, which uses industrial partnerships of a high standard, both technically and financially. They track ELVs and ensure that the overall recovery rate is achieved. At the end of 2021, the Company\u2019s industrial partners were working with networks of 436 certified dismantling companies for former PSA Brands, and 612 for former FCA Brands, with 222 common dismantling companies.\n\nIn Regions outside Europe, the Company is actively analyzing the regional and local market situation as well as ELV-related legislation. The Company adopts and develops strategies and plans for implementation depending on the local and regional requirement and constraints.\n\n- U.S.: the environmental effects of vehicles at the end-of-life stage are reduced using a market-driven recycling infrastructure, making automobiles and their components among the most recycled consumer products in that country.\n- Asia, some countries have developed momentum around waste legislation. Stellantis is cooperating with partners in China on batteries recycling.\n- India, we have a business partnership to support the development of Waste Law to treat ELVs and HVBs.\n- Africa, Stellantis implemented a study with Morocco\u2019s government to improve the collection and treatment of ELV.\n\n**Individual System to manage End-of-Life Vehicles (ELV):**\n\nIn 2022, Stellantis collected and processed with an internal Individual System 19,692 of ELVs in France for all Brands. These accounted for 23,047 tons of material recovered, of which 88% was recycled.\n\n**Actions Plan to collect and treat abandoned ELVs:**\n\nStellantis made a major contribution to piloting the action plan for the re-absorption of historic stocks of abandoned ELVs in the French overseas territories in which the French Environmental Code applies (Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Martinique, French Guyana, Reunion Island, Saint Pierre-et-Miquelon Island and Mayotte). This plan, which addresses the environmental and health issues that arise when their last owner abandons vehicles, resulted in the signing of a framework agreement between manufacturers on October 24, 2018. At the end of 2022, this action plan was active in French overseas departments with 29,702 abandoned ELVs collected since the program started in 2018.\n\n**6.1.7.7 Main initiatives to provide customers with offers in the circular economy mindset:**\n\n- **sustainable spare parts, verified pre-owned cars.**\n  - Affordable maintenance with replacement parts for all budgets in a circular economy mindset\n    - Stellantis provides an extensive range of spare parts coming from the circular economy, under the SUSTAINera label. It is an eco-responsible complement to the Stellantis spare parts offer to provide customers with solutions that match their needs, budget, vehicle age or brand of vehicle.\nThe SUSTAINera parts and accessories program implements the 4R strategy through:\n\n- a full range of remanufactured parts;\n- a multi-brand original reused parts catalog;\n- a \"repair and return\" service for multi-brand automatic gearboxes and complex electronic components;\n- recycling of parts and materials coming from the production, maintenance and end-of-life vehicle treatment.\n\nThe total range of sustainable parts covers more than 13% of customers after-sales needs and aims to help reduce the cost of vehicle ownership, decrease the volume of materials heading to landfills and lower energy consumption.\n\n**Remanufactured Parts:** Remanufactured product lines include parts such as starters, alternators, brake calipers, electronic control modules, high-voltage battery packs, torque converters, steering, suspension and engine and transmission product categories. Depending on the part, the average raw-material usage is reduced between 60% to 95%, while CO\u2082 emissions are reduced between 30% to 80% compared with new part production (values determined according to a methodology approved by an independent company - Sphera). The Company certifies the production of remanufactured parts, manufactured internally or through specialized providers, in order to provide a sustainable solution that is equivalent to original equipment parts and provides the same warranty conditions as new parts.\n\nREMAN offer has been launched in Brazil, South America in Q2 2022. The first stage of the program covers approximately 100 part numbers already available in approximately 1,000 dealerships in Brazil, of Citro\u00ebn, Fiat, Jeep and Peugeot brands, some of the Stellantis brands in the country. The five product lines available at launch are: starter motors, alternators, steering boxes, turbochargers and automatic gearboxes. The expectation is to expand the remanufactured parts line to include injectors and high-pressure pumps. Overall worldwide key figures: 37 product lines including batteries, representing more than 13,000 part numbers.\n\n**Reused Parts:** In 2020 Stellantis invested in Amanh\u00e3 Global allowing a multibrand re-used parts offer to customers including B2C and B2B though an advanced e-commerce platform. In 2022, there were sales in 155 countries.\n\n**\"Repair & Return\" service: extending the lifespan of complex products:** Since 2011, Stellantis has been offering a \"Repair & Return\" service for both automatic gearboxes and complex electronic products. This has been expanded to include other repair services including HVB through a network of 21 e-repair centers around the world.\n\nIn 2022, Stellantis repair range includes 12 product lines.\nRevenue generation from all circular economy\n\nAs part of the Stellantis Dare Forward strategic plan presented in March 2022 and of the target to be carbon net zero by 2038, Stellantis created a dedicated Business Unit to develop circular economy activities. This Circular Economy Business Unit is mainly focusing on Remanufactured, Repaired, and Reused Parts business, and on developing the Recycling loop for Stellantis parts and vehicles. The Dare Forward ambition for Circular Economy Business Unit is to reach \u20ac2 billion total revenue generation by 2030 on this scope of activities.\n\nThe dealer network, promotes circular economy through various offerings: remanufactured parts, repair services in Europe and reused parts from end-of-life vehicles dismantling. In 2022, the Business Unit also launched SUSTAINera as the Stellantis Circular Economy Label for all reman, repair, reuse, recycled activities. In terms of geographical extension, the Circular Economy Business Unit started to develop a new remanufactured parts offer in South America.\n\nIn addition, in September 2022, Stellantis announced the creation of its first industrial hub in Italy which is dedicated to circular economy in order to support the growth ambition in this business.\n\n- Developing pre-owned vehicles activities\n  - In 2021 Stellantis continued to develop its Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) policy with the deployment in G10 countries of its Spoticar CPO Program for all mainstream brands and DS Certified for its DS premium brand. Spoticar was also launched in Turkey, and a dedicated program is in preparation for Alfa Romeo brand. A CPO program provides customers a label for pre-owned cars, which are checked, reconditioned, certified and warranted. On Spoticar and DS Certified websites, Stellantis provides product information, pictures and when available videos to make sure customers are fully informed about the car they are looking at.\n  - Alongside with CPO programs, Stellantis continues to develop customer satisfaction measurement for our pre-owned vehicles customers: already active in France, this program will be activated in all G10 countries in 2022 to ensure our dealers provide to customers the best possible experience, with the same level of attention than towards new cars customers.\n  - Stellantis also supported the development of multi-brand B2C business Aramis Group, through a successful IPO (Initial Public Offering) on Euronext stock market in June 2021. This allows Aramis Group to sustain its European growth, in France, Spain, Belgium, the UK since early 2021 and potentially in other markets. Aramis Group provides customers with a top-level digital experience, proposing affordable refurbished cars of all makes. Aramis Group refurbishment facilities are managed in order to preserve resources (70% of waste generated by refurbishing activities were recycled in 2020) and is committed to further reduce the environmental impact of these activities. Aramis governance is also compliant with market best practices, with independent members of the Board, a balanced gender representation and the creation of dedicated committees of the Board for nominations, compensations and benefits as well as for CSR. The Company is committed to develop and retain talents (70% of the workforce trained in 2020, Great place to work program), to achieve maximum safety at work and to embrace team diversity.\nIMPACT MEASUREMENT OF THE ELECTRIFICATION STRATEGY\n\nElectrification is likely to increase the global demand for the materials for the manufacturing of Low-Emission Vehicles (LEVs): mainly cobalt, lithium and nickel. To preserve the natural resources as well as to mitigate the risk of scarcity, Stellantis works to reduce its consumption of materials in LEV manufacturing through the implementation of a full circular economy battery life cycle management starting by extending the lifespan of the battery for automotive usage through repair and remanufacturing, then implementing battery Second-life solutions.\n\nIn 2022, 2,261 of the batteries used in Stellantis\u2019 vehicles had a life cycle management solution: 149 were repaired, 1,032 were remanufactured, 426 were used in Second-life projects, and 654 were recycled. When the batteries are no longer suited for vehicle use, they are reused for energy stationary storage purposes. The company also collaborates with qualified recycling companies, with the objective to recycle with the most efficient process a growing number of batteries in Europe and North America.\n\nThe Company also works to increase battery energy density which would decrease the quantity of raw materials needed per unit of energy. Stellantis conducts research and development activities for solid-state batteries and chemical compositions for other raw materials that are not considered critical. From 2024, Stellantis plans to base its electrification strategy on two battery technologies, both without cobalt.\n\nTo secure lithium availability, Stellantis signed two memorandums of understanding for new direct off-take with lithium geothermal partners in North America and Europe. The Company\u2019s Tier 1 battery suppliers have also contracted lithium suppliers in Europe. For the longer term, Stellantis prepares to set up off-take agreements of recycled raw materials with recyclers.\n\n6.1.7.8 Specific initiatives related to High-Voltage Batteries (HVB)\n\nWhen HVBs cannot be used in vehicles, Stellantis HVBs can be processed in up to three solutions:\n\n- **Repair and Remanufacturing**\n  Repair and Remanufacturing extend the use phase and avoid the premature recycling of High-Voltage Batteries (HVBs). To reinforce the sustainability of its HVBs, for the new generation developed for its brands, Stellantis is expanding a repair and remanufacturing process. If the battery fails, it will either be repaired in the network or sent to a remanufacturing center. The repaired battery will then be reinstalled in the vehicle from which it had been removed whereas the remanufactured one will be used in another used electric vehicle to maintain the electric mobility of the Company\u2019s customers as long as possible.\n  In 2022 we confirmed the extension of E-Repair Centers Regional coverage to 21 centers, strengthening the presence in Enlarged Europe and opening in India and Asia Pacific region.\n\n- **Second-life**\n  Stellantis is also continuing to work on solutions to repurpose for reuse HVBs in non-automotive business in order to use batteries as long as possible before sending them to recycling, prioritizing Second-life activities.\n  To study the ability of current next-generation EV batteries to be reused in Second-life for stationary storage applications, Stellantis is exploring the reuse of these batteries by designing, building and testing electric stationary storage demonstrators, focused on residential, commercial and industrial use in particular with its Joint Venture with NHOA Free2move e-solutions.\nAt the same time, Stellantis is still evaluating partnership opportunities with utility companies in order to design, build and operate a large-scale pilot of an energy stationary storage facility.\n\nIn 2022 Stellantis has collaborated with several utility companies and battery integrators by providing Second-life batteries and collaborating with them in designing and creating energy storage facilities.\n\n**Recycling Process**\n\nIn 2015, Peugeot, Citro\u00ebn and DS have signed a contract for the European markets. Our partner obtained the silver medal for its CSR performance awarded in 2019 by the organization EcoVadis. At the end of 2020, former PSA extended this partnership to Opel and Vauxhall brands for the new-generation of PHEV and BEV traction batteries. In order to recycle higher battery volumes and optimize the associated logistics costs, Stellantis selected local recyclers by geographical zones. The same process is planned with the former FCA brands, which previously developed local solutions by country.\n\nIn 2021, the partner\u2019s recycling rates were 69.3% for Lithium-Ion (Li-ion) batteries and 83.8% for Nickel Metal Hydride (Ni MH) batteries.

Reducing vehicle emissions necessitates substantial research and development investments on technologies by vehicle manufacturers which can have a direct impact on their financial performance and profitability.\n\nGiven the frequent media coverage, such effects reflect an important reputational issue for automobile companies. Air quality and associated public health concerns have resulted in the introduction of local, state, country and international regulations to control atmospheric pollutant emissions in many areas of the world, including a wide variety of markets into which Stellantis sells its products.\n\nIn addition, there are a growing number of cities that impose traffic restrictions that inhibit certain vehicles\u2019 operation, both by geography and by time of day.\n\nStellantis continues its significant efforts to produce vehicles that comply with regulations and at the same time meet consumer demands, including the growing demands for sustainable mobility. This includes current and near-term plans to increase our portfolio of electrified vehicles. Stellantis is also developing advanced emission control technologies to minimize environmental impact of internal combustion engines. These combined actions support our goal of reducing emissions of our products.\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nThe Company is committed to continuing its longstanding efforts to reduce the environmental impact from our products, which at a minimum requires us to develop and produce vehicles that meet applicable emission standards worldwide.\n\nStellantis supports efforts to cooperate with the relevant public institutions/governmental agencies in the review and improvement of regulations in order to reflect the improved technology while maintaining a reasonable balance between sound science, availability of technologies, consumer demand, societal benefits, and affordability.\n\nThe Company recognizes the role of public institutions and/or national and local governments supporting a green transition in electrified mobility including the use of government incentives to facilitate that transition.\n\n6.2.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\nCommitment scoreboard\n\n| CSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE | VISION/AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | RESULTS |\n|----------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|---------|\n|                      |                 |                | Short-term | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan) | Long-term |\n|                      |                 |                | 2022       | 2021    |\n| Vehicle impact on air quality | Meaningfully reduce impact on air quality by focusing on development of a wide range of affordable Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV) | Share of ZEV* in global sales mix (focus on U.S. and EU) | 2025: EU: 34% of Passenger Cars U.S.: 14% of Passenger Cars + Light Duty Trucks | 2030: EU: 100% of Passenger Cars U.S.: 50% of Passenger Cars + Light Duty Trucks | 2038: EU: 100% of Passenger Cars U.S.: 100% of Passenger Cars + Light Duty Trucks |\n|                      |                 |                | 2022       | 2021    |\n|                      |                 |                | EU: 11.2% of Passenger Cars U.S.: n.a. | EU: 8% of Passenger Cars U.S.: n.a. |\n|                      |                 |                | 2022       | 2021    |\n|                      |                 |                | EU: 14% of Passenger Cars U.S.: n.a. | EU: 15% of Passenger Cars U.S.: n.a. |\n\n*ZEV = Zero Emission Vehicles (Battery Electric Vehicles)\n6.2.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n6.2.3.1 Risks\n\nGlobal emissions standards continue to become increasingly stringent. The Company is committed to working toward achieving the standards through innovation and development and is aware of the concerns regarding potential health issues. Stellantis is aware that there are risks associated with the changing requirements and associated costs related to the product development. Product environmental innovations are essential for the achievement of such standards. These innovations help prevent delayed vehicle launches and the associated financial risks. The annual risk of loss of revenue for Stellantis, according to internal estimates, is \u20ac1.2 to \u20ac2.4 billion due to unwanted delayed vehicle launches.\n\nThe U.S. has the most stringent pollutant emission standards. However, with the introduction of the Real Driving Emission (RDE) regulations in Europe and other markets that borrow European Union regulations, the global emissions compliance standards are reducing ever closer to the U.S. standards. An example is the European Union\u2019s (EU) adoption of Euro 6e, coupled with the expected introduction of Euro 7 standards from 2025. In the U.S., the fleet emissions for light duty vehicles will be required to meet 30 mg/mile of NOx and Non-Methane Organic Gases (NMOG) and the LEV IV ACC 2 regulation by 2025. Brazil will launch the PL8 emission standard in 2025. The release of the first draft of China 7 standards is projected in 2023.\n\nCurrent and future regional emission standards\n\n| Already compliant | United States | Europe | China | Other Regions |\n|-------------------|---------------|--------|-------|---------------|\n| California\u2019s low emission Vehicle II (LEV II) | Euro 6d Real Driving Emission (RDE) standards | National Stage 6a (China 6a) LDV emission standards nationwide | India: Bharat Stage VI (BS VI) stage 1 |\n| Environmental protection Agency (EPA) Tier 2 | National Stage 6b (China 6b) LDV emission standards in five cities and provinces | Brazil: Proconve L7 |\n| | | Argentina: Euro 5 |\n| | | South Korea: California LEV III for gasoline, Euro 6d RDE for diesel |\n| | | Middle East: Standards based from Euro 2 to Euro 5 |\n| Phase-in for compliance | California\u2019s LEV III standards, closely aligned with EPA\u2019s Tier 3 | Euro 6e Real Driving Emission (RDE) standard (September 2023) | National Stage 6b (China 6b) LDV (July 2023) | India: Bharat Stage VI (BS VI) stage 2 (April 2023) |\n| | | Brazil: Proconve L8 (January 2025) |\n\nFor more risk information refer to table IMPACTS OF CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS ON STELLANTIS CSR ISSUES in 2.3.1.\nOur European vehicles are capable of meeting the Euro 6e targets ahead of the requirement date.\n\n### MAIN CURRENT AND FUTURE EXPECTED REGULATIONS LIMITS\n\n| (mg/km)          | NOx [mg/km] | NMOG [mg/km] | CO [mg/km] |\n|------------------|-------------|--------------|------------|\n| U.S. SULEV* 20   | 12          | 622          |            |\n| U.S. SULEV 30    | 19          | 622          |            |\n| U.S. ULEV 50**   | 31          | 1057         |            |\n| EU Euro 7 (draft)*** | 60        | 68 ****      | 500        |\n| China 6b         | 35          | 35 ****      | 500        |\n\n* SULEV: Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicles  \n** ULEV: Ultra Low Emission Vehicles  \n*** Euro 7 data refers to the draft published on November 10, 2022  \n**** Non-Methane Hydrocarbons (NMHC) emissions\n6.2.3.2 Opportunities\n\nAir quality requirements can be seen as both business and reputation opportunities for Stellantis. Stellantis is continuing to improve the Company\u2019s image and the image of the brands by providing vehicles with the advanced technologies that are required in the markets with the most stringent regulations, to other countries and markets.\n\nOpportunities to further develop the business and elevate the company\u2019s image include:\n\n- Increase offerings of battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, as well as improved emissions for internal combustion engine vehicles. For instance, eight battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles were launched in 2022 and 14 are expected to be launched in 2023.\n- Develop hydrogen Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) solutions for Heavy and Light Duty Commercial vehicles.\n- Extend the vehicle portfolio with fuel cell technology within LCV segment.\n- Support regulations improvements and incentives for market acceptance of low emission vehicles and vehicles with electrified powertrains. For instance, one vehicle under Euro 3 standards emits the same mass of particulate emissions as 100 vehicles under Euro 5-6.\n- Develop a patent portfolio of technologies (electric heated catalyst).\n- Sell advanced engine technology licenses to competitors.\n\nIMPACT MEASUREMENT OF THE ELECTRIFICATION STRATEGY\n\nLow Emission Vehicles (LEVs) generate significantly lower emissions compared to ICE vehicles. Therefore, the sale of LEVs enables Stellantis to be more readily compliant with emissions regulations worldwide, but especially notably in the EU, in the U.S., in China and Brazil). Indeed, increasingly stringent and complex regulations set emission caps for certain pollutants and define restricted traffic zones. Furthermore, the sale of LEVs engages a virtuous circle: it provides Stellantis with reputational benefits while responding to evolving customers\u2019 expectations and governmental/public institutions focus on improving air quality. Increasing our customers\u2019 demand and desire for our lower-emitting and non-emitting vehicles reduces our overall impact on air quality. These are fundamental aspects of the rationale behind the company\u2019s electrification policy.\n6.2.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nConsistent with the commitment of and made by our management, Stellantis aim is to ensure compliance from technical and legal points of view, as well for governmental emission certification/issuing of the type approval to allow our vehicles to be sold. Employees involved in meeting compliance and regulations of emissions are expected to know and respect not only the requirements imposed by applicable laws and regulations, but also the applicable internal rules and processes we use to help achieve such compliance. To support this, employees have access to processes that use and make available information databases, technical and engineering guidelines, networks of meetings and governance, reference documents, and training materials.\n\nEmission compliance committee governance is used, in the form of engineering working groups associated with management oversight regional committees, to report emission compliance operation and policy decisions to the Global Technical Safety & Regulatory Compliance Manager and other Senior Management in Engineering, Planning, Legal, and related organizations, regarding tailpipe emissions, CO\u2082 emissions, hybrid and battery-electric vehicles all-electric range, evaporative emissions, and On-Board Diagnostics.\n\nThese regional committees, all structured of the same manner, are autonomous and include core and contributing members, which are independent and cross-functional, and which allow them to make objective and well-researched decisions. Decisions are made by considering regulatory, technical and legal expertise. Some of the activities include review of technical policy, regulatory assumptions, design rules, program approvals, guidance on emission compliance questions and guidelines. If necessary, these regional committees inform the Global Technical Safety & Regulatory Compliance Manager and other relevant members of Senior Management.\n\n6.2.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nStellantis is focused on making responsible and prudent environmental policy decisions that touch our vehicles\u2019 timeline, from initial concept to product launch, as well as the \u201cin-use\u201d phase, when our products are in the hands of our customers.\n\n6.2.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nStellantis continuously makes R&D investments to the improvement of vehicle tailpipe emissions quality and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. These investments, around \u20ac2 billion have led to worldwide development of technical solutions (electrification, etc.) to improve reduction of fossil fuel consumption and pollutant emissions.\n\nTo develop new technologies, we adopted the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) process. This methodology provides a consistent and uniform assessment process to grade the technical maturity of different technologies. The levels of technical maturity are aligned with the Global Product Development Plan and maturity gate levels are achieved based on stakeholder reviews.\n\n> For Stellantis electrification policy refer to 2.5.1\n6.2.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\n6.2.7.1 Improve air quality by reducing vehicle emissions\n\nTo minimize particulate matter emissions, both in particle numbers and mass, optimized engine measures and the use of wall flow particulate filters are effective technologies. Particulate filters allow the screening of both fine and ultra-fine particulate matter. Depending on the fuel the result can achieve up to 99.7% by number and up to more than 95% by mass. The particulate filter is an effective mechanical system which is fully operational throughout the phases of engine operation and driving conditions.\n\nWith the introduction of the particulate filter in the late 1990s, particulate emissions plummeted from more than 3,500,000 particulates per cm\u00b3 in an unfiltered Internal Combustion Engine to less than 3,500 particulates per cm\u00b3 in an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) with a particulate filter.\n\n**COMPARISON OF PARTICULATE EMISSIONS LEVELS OF AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE FITTED WITH A PARTICULATE FILTER**\n\n| Clean (mountain) air | Air from an ICE fitted with a particulate filter | Clean-room air | Air near a busy road | Cigarette smoke | Air in traffic | \u201cDirty\u201d industrial site |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------|----------------|---------------|------------------------|\n| < 1,500              | < 3,500                                       | 4,000          | from 10,000 to 40,000| from 50,000 to 60,000| from 100,000 to 1,000,000 |\n\nNumber of particles per cm\u00b3\n\nIn 2022, 74.5% of ICE passenger cars were sold with technology for particulate emissions to reach values lower than 1.9 mg per km (3 mg per mile) for both spark ignition and compression engines.\n\nWe have developed and continue to improve the technology for a high performing filter for spark ignition engines to further reduce ultrafine particles from gasoline engines. The technology development takes into account the new constraints resulting from powertrain electrification. This new filter technology was launched mid 2022 in Europe and enables us to be capable to meet the Euro 6e targets ahead of the requirement date.\n\n1 Source: French Agency for the Environment and Energy Management (ADEME): particulate and NOx emissions by road vehicles \u2013 May 2018\nAlso, Nitrogen Oxides (NO\\textsubscript{x}) emissions are minimized adopting different technologies for ICE: Three Way Catalyst and Selective Catalyst Reduction are the main technologies for vehicle applications around the world.\n\nTo reduce vapor emissions from fuel systems, also known as Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and to fulfill more stringent regulations in main markets such as EU, China and U.S., Stellantis continuously seeks to improve technology for our evaporative emission control system.\n\nBecause compliance with emission requirements in all global markets is our primary goal, we continue to engineer and implement improved and newly-developed advanced emission control technologies in order to achieve that in markets with the most stringent emission regulations, such as the U.S. and Europe. Moreover, we anticipate this can confer additional clean air benefits in other markets in which such improved and advanced technologies may be deployed as well.\n\n6.2.7.2 Partnering transparency\n\nPeugeot, Citro\u00ebn and DS Automobile brands of Stellantis have taken an innovative approach to customer transparency by publishing its vehicles\u2019 real (on the road) fuel consumption. Measurements are taken in accordance with a specific test protocol audited by an internationally renowned independent organization. The measurement protocol developed has proven to be extremely reliable for testing real-world fuel consumption and CO\\textsubscript{2} emissions. The experiment methodology was reproduced and also used to measure NO\\textsubscript{x} and particulate emissions, as well. Since 2018 Peugeot, Citro\u00ebn and DS brands publish the results of these tests to contribute to further increasing the reliability of automotive tests and measurements.\n\nTo date, Peugeot, Citro\u00ebn and DS Automobile brands of Stellantis are among the few vehicle manufacturers to have made such a commitment of transparency to benefit towards its customers.\n\n6.3 Industrial environmental footprint\n\nStellantis environmental stewardship endeavors to achieve the objective of reducing our environmental footprint and to contribute to the Company\u2019s financial success by reducing production costs. Through the adoption of a lean, smart and increasingly digital operating model, a commitment to sustainable innovation, and the direct participation of employees in the pursuit of excellence, we achieve consistent improvements in environmental performance at our manufacturing operations.\n\n6.3.1 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nAs outlined in chapter 1.3.2 of this report, the function of the ESG Committee is to assist and advise the Board of Directors and act under authority delegated by the Board of Directors with respect to monitoring, evaluation and reporting on the sustainable policies and practices, management standards, strategy, performance and governance.\nAccountable members of the Top Executive Team are supporting the CSR commitments. The Executive Vice-President (EVP) Manufacturing is responsible for:\n\n- Industrial and sites carbon footprint\n- Optimization of material cycles in manufacturing processes (including waste)\n- Control of industrial discharges and nuisances\n- Sustainable water management\n- Protection of biodiversity\n\nIn this role, the EVP of Manufacturing validates the CSR vision, ambitions and targets for these CSR issues and is responsible for their achievement. To ensure Stellantis is working towards these ambitions, we monitor our performance against CSR targets using global KPIs.\n\nAlthough our Manufacturing facilities are mainly contributing to the CSR performance, our CSR scope comprises additional Research and Development facilities including proving grounds, Offices, IT / Warehouse / Logistics centers and Retail facilities that based on their sizes and operations are considered to have an environmental impact. Therefore, the EVP Manufacturing liaises with EVP Research and Development, EVP Sales/Marketing and EVP HR & Transformation on the environmental performance of these areas.\n\nCSR performance is reviewed regularly on a monthly basis and appropriate actions decided with regional leadership. The EVP of the Regions together with the Manufacturing officers are responsible to develop their plans and implement actions to meet the CSR targets. On an annual basis, the plant managers of our production facilities are expected to prepare site-specific plans including targets, actions and necessary investments to meet our environmental CSR commitments. They are responsible for the environmental performance of their plant. By a new oversight process Stellantis verifies that local plant performance targets meet corporate commitments. Starting this year individual plant targets for 2023 are calculated and proposed to each plant considering current performance status, local environmental infrastructure and business opportunities. Plants revise proposals, decide their targets and develop action plans with clearly defined measures and its resulting performance improvements. The regional Environmental Central Departments (ECD) monitor compliance with the regional targets.\n\nThe ECD helps facilities with legal compliance and supports the local EMS by developing efficiencies and common standards. The ECD oversees and manages the quality of the EMS through audits and status reviews. ECD conducts strategic cross functional planning for reducing the environmental impact and manages the target setting process. ECD evaluates and shares best practices with the plants to encourage continuous improvement.\n\nContinuous improvement of our environmental performance is an essential element of our policy and a common key task for sites and central functions. Environmental performance is fully integrated into the Lean Manufacturing System of Stellantis and tracked with the main Manufacturing KPIs by a standardized score card process. Monthly leadership performance status reviews on a local and corporate level helps effectiveness of implemented measures and improves the environmental footprint according to the strategic plan.\n6.3.2 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\n6.3.2.1 Environmental and Energy Policy\n\nIn December 2022 we published the Stellantis corporate Environment and Energy Policy, which was developed with input from cross functional divisions reflecting contributions of the various functions to the Stellantis environmental performance. This policy describes how we protect the environment, provides guidance for our operations and employees and includes commitments required by ISO standards for environmental and energy management systems. The environmental policy is approved by Stellantis executive management.\n\n6.3.2.2 An active ISO 14001 certification policy\n\nAn important Company commitment is to implement environmental management systems. The systems meet the international standard ISO 14001, a recognized standard for management and organization. By using this approach, we have implemented a common environmental strategy to identify the material environmental aspects of each site, reduce the environmental impact, draft procedures and standards, drive regulatory compliance and strive for continual improvement \u2013 the foundation of our environmental protection.\n\nAn environmental management system is in place at 92% of our production facilities. In addition to the production facilities, three Research and Development (Engineering) centers and 24 spare part warehouses globally have ISO 14001 certified environmental management system implemented.\n\n6.3.3 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\n6.3.3.1 Managing Environmental Compliance and Performance - with the Stellantis Production Way (SPW)\n\nSPW is our manufacturing system that applies to our manufacturing processes and facilities. The system includes references to standardized tools, guidance documents and processes, which translate abstract requirements into tangible actions for production. SPW consists of two managerial and 10-technical domains, one of which is environment. At the heart of the environment domain our master fundamental \u201cManaging Environmental Compliance and Performance\u201d provides the framework for our mission to:\n\n- comply with laws and regulations;\n- achieve environmental performance though continual improvement;\n- maintain an environmental management system;\n- minimize use of energy and raw materials, strive for zero waste, zero emissions and zero water withdrawal for industrial activities, reduce GHG emissions;\n- enhance biodiversity and preserve natural habitats;\nencourage engagement and motivation of employees;\nbe an environmentally conscious neighbor in the community.\n\nThe following list shows some of the benefits of applying the SPW environment domain into our production processes:\n\n- promotes visibility for environmental management responsibilities and tasks;\n- fosters understanding of environmental matters;\n- increases efficiency and reduces costs due to standardized processes and tools;\n- improves and aligns quality of environmental management;\n- integrates ISO 14001 standard elements following the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle;\n- links with compliance management and oversight.\n\nAs part of SPW, we use global Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to track plants\u2019 environmental performance against the targets. In 2022, we moved to one global software system for monthly performance reporting which enables internal benchmarking through consistent data management. Trends are evaluated for each KPI and shared with leadership in regular reports. KPI statistics are used to identify performance gaps and to determine the plants that need additional focused support through workshops. Best performing facilities are considered a source of Best Practices. They share their processes between plants regionally and globally, if applicable.\n\nStellantis defined a Green Factory KPI based on the materiality matrix which consolidates the six KPIs including, CO\u2082, waste volume and recovery rate, VOC emissions, water consumption, and biodiversity into one KPI. This approach references the Stellantis 2050 environmental performance targets and provide an index that shows the performance to the target for operating facilities.\n\n6.3.3.2 Environmental resources\n\nStellantis operations aim to achieve compliance with local regulations, and beyond compliance we seek to safeguard the surrounding environment and the quality of life in our host communities. To meet our objectives, we defined the role of the environmental specialist as a key function that requires specific competence and training. The role is standardized globally by job description outlining the technical and social skills required. As part of the Stellantis Production Way there are skill evaluations and standardized trainings conducted for team leaders, supervisors and experts. We are reviewing training programs to expand to management level offerings. Training courses will include face-to-face sessions, experience sharing opportunities and e-learning. Courses and training session attendance and requirements are tracked.\n\nOur environmental specialists are supported by a network of nominated environmental representatives, from the key operational functions including but not limited to press shop, body shop, paint shop, general assembly and facility management. Most of the plants also include environmental service providers such as the waste manager in the supporting network. The environmental representatives are responsible to help ensure compliance with applicable regulation; for implementing the environmental policy and this includes managing the Environmental Management System (EMS) in compliance with ISO 14001 standards. They are also responsible for supporting the CSR activities at the facility level.\n6.4 Optimization of material cycles in manufacturing processes (including waste)\n\n6.4.1 CONTEXT AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\nCSR issue/challenge #16: Optimization of material cycles in manufacturing processes (including waste)\n\nStellantis continues its development of a circular economy and industrial processes that allow us to reduce the usage of raw materials. This also includes material reuse, recovery and recycling. The processes are intended to avoid wasting natural resources and using only the quantity of raw materials necessary. By encouraging the use of recovery and recycling opportunities, this strategy also extends into waste management, striving for minimal environmental impact and our goal of zero waste to landfill.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nStellantis stands by the waste management goals defined by Global Compact. Additionally, as part of the ISO 14001 certification obtained by most of our plants, we develop and implement consistent improvements in environmental areas, including waste management. Stellantis strives to recycle what cannot be reused. If neither reuse nor recovery is possible, waste is disposed according to applicable law with the aim of impacting the environment as little as possible.\n\n6.4.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\n| CSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE | VISION/AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | RESULTS |\n|----------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|---------|\n| 16 Optimization of material cycles in manufacturing processes (including waste) | Design industrial processes that allow minimal use of raw materials and ensure 100% waste recycling in local loops of circular economy | Total waste normalized (kg/vehicle produced) | Short-term: 2025: 40 kg/vehicle produced | 2022: 47.43 kg/vehicle produced |\n| | | | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan): 2030: 36 kg/vehicle produced | 2021: 48.15 kg/vehicle produced |\n| | | | Long-term: 2050: 22.5 kg/vehicle produced | |\n| | | Percentage of waste recovered out of total waste generated | 2025: 84% | 81% |\n| | | | 2030: 90% | 80% |\n| | | | 2050: 100% | |\n| | | Percentage of plants with Zero Waste Sent to Landfill | 2025: 65% | 65% |\n| | | | 2030: 75% | 61% |\n| | | | 2050: 100% | |\n\n1Revised from 2021 Non-financial information Annual Report\n6.4.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n6.4.3.1 Risks\n\nStellantis identified some risks and has implemented several actions and initiatives to mitigate them.\n\n- **Potential business risk:**\n  - Dependency from raw materials constraints and increasing supply cost due to material scarcity.\n  - Packaging material represents approximately 50% of waste generated at our production facilities. Global sourcing due to cost pressure, favors the usage of one-way packaging that ends-up as waste at our plants.\n  - Stellantis has responsibility for hazardous and non-hazardous waste through final disposal of waste. Third-party service providers such as waste contractors or waste treatment and disposal facilities that fail to comply with transport or other waste regulations may cause fines or legal prosecution for Stellantis.\n\n- **Potential operational risk:**\n  - Emerging contaminants, e.g., Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP), may limit recycling options and therefore limit our disposal methods.\n  - More stringent regulations, including concentration limits, quotas, and bans, may force us to use expensive treatment methods or increase waste segregation costs.\n  - Lack of local waste treatment facilities may lead to waste being shipped long distances at higher costs and an increased dependency on service providers.\n  - Landfills located close to production facilities compete economically with waste recovery facilities located in greater distances. Unfavorable business cases may limit our plants achieving or maintaining zero waste to landfill status.\n\n- **Potential reputation risk:**\n  - Stellantis being held responsible for failures of third-party waste service providers that violate contractual obligations for example by illegally dumping waste. Even if Stellantis fulfilled all its obligations, this may lead to media attention resulting in impact to brand value, customer defection and legal prosecution.\n  - Stellantis being held responsible for increasing pollution to the environment by continuing landfilling instead of using recovery. This may result in impact to brand value, customer defection and loss of profit.\n6.4.3.2 Opportunities\n\nStellantis identified opportunities and has implemented several actions to seize them.\n\n- **Opportunities for the business:**\n  - Shifting the focus from waste management to resource management. This offers the opportunity to view waste materials as secondary raw material and unlock their value by transforming costs into revenue. Best practice sharing may help identify other industries interested in using these secondary raw materials.\n  - To standardize waste contracts that include flexibility to react on fluctuating costs or volumes and require key performance improvement indicators for service providers to support our targets of waste reduction, increased recovery rate and zero waste to landfill.\n  - Base decisions on a full cycle cost view for packaging materials that includes purchasing to waste disposal.\n  - To reduce waste handling costs and improve recyclability, set standards for packaging materials that avoid composite materials and favor materials that are easy to separate. Reduce complexity and variety of materials used to have less waste fractions but higher volumes, which may lead to better disposal prices or even revenues.\n\n- **Opportunity for operational management:**\n  - Set standards for contractor management and auditing of waste service providers to control risks related to compliance failures.\n  - Make use of new ideas and technologies for instance working with start-ups to improve the quality of waste sorting, optimizing flows or identifying options for reuse or usage as secondary raw material. This may lead to establishing local circular material loops.\n  - Minimize usage of hazardous substances to decrease hazardous waste which reduces the costs of waste treatment and disposal.\n  - Identify opportunities to reuse waste as secondary raw material on-site or with external partners.\n\n- **Opportunities for reputation:**\n  - Become an industry major player in circular economy reducing the impact for the environment and improve brand image and sales.\n  - Reaching 100% waste recovery represents a sustainable waste management practice and supports the reputation of the Company.\n6.4.4 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nOur waste management processes seek to avoid and reduce the generation of waste in our operational processes. If we cannot avoid waste being generated, we preferentially attempt to recover material rather than dispose waste in landfills, which may have a long-term negative impact on the environment. Like other industries, vehicle manufacturing generates waste that needs to be managed and preferably recovered in local loops to reduce the need for raw materials.\n\n6.4.4.1 Main achievements on waste management\n\nIn 2022, Stellantis generated 302,858 tons of waste (versus 305,468 tons in 2021) of which 273,597 tons (versus 273,850 tons in 2021) were generated at manufacturing sites and 29,261 tons (versus 31,618 tons in 2021) from Retail activities.\n\nTotal Waste by Disposal Type in % and tons\n\n| Disposal Type | 2022 | 2021 |\n|---------------|------|------|\n| Recycling     | 70%  | 68%  |\n|               | 212,333 tons | 206,656 tons |\n| Energy Recovery | 12%  | 14%  |\n|               | 34,882 tons | 42,215 tons |\n| Incineration  | 2%   | 2%   |\n|               | 6,556 tons | 7,310 tons |\n| Landfilling   | 11%  | 12%  |\n|               | 34,731 tons | 37,198 tons |\n| Other Treatment | 5%   | 4%   |\n|               | 14,356 tons | 12,089 tons |\n\nTotal waste generated includes only material that we discard resulting from our operations. Therefore, we exclude waste generated in demolishing, building or remediation activities, which are not part of our operations. In 2022, waste generated from such projects added up to 34,263 tons in total versus 38,157 tons in 2021. In addition, we exclude metal waste and some wastes that are specific for foundries to enable better comparison of data with other automobile manufacturers. In 2022, the total amount of metal waste summed up to 1,057,057 tons versus 1,053,388 tons in 2021, of which 100% were recycled. The excluded waste types coming from our foundries added up to 218,057 tons versus 174,474 tons in 2021 and consisted predominately of foundry sands, the majority of which are regenerated or reused on site.\n\nIn 2022, we generated 55,603 tons of hazardous waste, which represents 18% of total waste generated versus 63,693 tons of hazardous waste, which represented 21% of total waste generated in 2021. The manufacturing activities generated 96% of the hazardous waste and retail activities 4%.\nFor our manufacturing activities, in 2022, 273,597 tons of waste were generated, the normalized total waste generated was 47.43 kg/vehicle produced versus 48.15 kg/vehicle produced in 2021. This represents a reduction of 0.72 kg/vehicle versus 2021. The normalized hazardous waste was 9.28 kg/vehicle versus 10.80 kg/vehicle produced in 2021. Although multiple factors such as production volume and the usage or avoidance of one-way packaging are significantly influencing waste performance of a production facility, we compare our production plants to identify the best performers and share their best practices.\n\nIn 2022, the best performing vehicle assembly plant was Brampton Assembly Plant with 8.48 kg of waste per vehicle produced (versus the best performer with 13.52 kg/vehicle in 2021). 55% versus 42% in 2021 of our vehicle assembly plants performed better than our medium-term target of 36 kg waste per vehicle produced.\n\nOur percentage of waste recovered out of total waste generated in 2022 was 81%, what represents an increase of 1% versus 2021. Waste recovered includes all recycled waste and waste that is incinerated with energy recovery.\n\nIn 2022, we landfilled 34,731 tons of waste, which represents 11% of our total waste generated, versus 37,198 tons in 2021 which represented 12% of total waste generated. 65% versus 61% in 2021 of all the active plants, qualified as zero waste to landfill facilities, which means that no waste was landfilled (except for any waste required to be landfilled due to applicable legislation).\n\nIf waste is disposed in a landfill, that waste is not available as secondary raw material; for those reasons landfilling contradicts our waste disposal commitments. In some jurisdictions, however, local law requires us to landfill our waste.\n\nThe waste streams with the biggest volumes generated at the Manufacturing facilities consists of the following:\n- packing waste (wood, cardboard and plastics)\n- paint operations waste (paint sludge, purge solvents)\n- municipal waste\n- waste water treatment system waste (sludge, oil or water emulsions).\n\nWaste derived from office activities consists of municipal waste. Depending on the specific retail activity, the waste generated is:\n- warehouse packaging waste\n- municipal waste from offices\n- oil and lubricant waste from dealerships with workshops and maintenance activities.\n6.4.4.2 Main initiatives on waste management\n\nAs outlined in section 6.4.3, the challenges impacting waste generation may require strategic decisions by Global Purchasing and Supply Chain or Engineering, and other risks may be addressed by operational measures. We apply our best practice in the support of our facilities\u2019 waste avoidance, reduction, recycling, reuse, or finding more environmentally friendly disposal methods. Some examples of successful initiatives to reduce waste generation or improve recovery are listed below:\n\n6.4.4.2.1 Initiatives to increase waste reduction and avoidance:\n\n- **Packaging waste reduction**: packaging materials play an important role in waste generation and represents roughly 50% of the total waste generated. The main waste streams are wood, cardboard, plastics and mixed fractions. Reducing the generation of packaging waste requires cross-functional efforts by multiple functions such as supply chain, purchasing, quality and manufacturing. New vehicle projects require early planning for the packaging materials. The planning includes determining where the materials come from, and which materials should be used in order to limit and control waste generated at plants. To support decisions, a series of workshops were conducted by central functions and environmental engineers from some European production sites. A list was generated that includes preferred packaging materials and ones we recommend that we avoid. Additional value was created by generating less waste streams with higher volumes that have a positive impact on recycling options and prices. This list of materials was incorporated into the standard packaging specifications used by Global Purchasing and Supply Chain in their procurement processes.\n\n- **Reuse of industrial assets**: in our global manufacturing facilities we reuse industrial assets across facilities such as machining and production equipment to avoid waste and use resources in a sustainable way. To enable reuse, we adapted equipment for different process needs, transferred them to other Stellantis facilities or sold them to other companies. In 2022, we transferred more than 7,000 assets globally, by these practices.\n\n- **Waste generation avoidance**:\n  - At our powertrain plant, Valenciennes (France) powertrain plant various improvements in the effluent system of the washing machines and phosphating have resulted in a reduction of phosphate sludge by approximately 236 tons annually and a reduction of emulsions from the washing water by approximately 720 tons per year.\n  - At our at our vehicle plant, in Atessa (Italy), improvements in the dewatering process for paint sludge in the paint shop have resulted in a reduced sludge generation of 23% per vehicle which resulted in an annual reduction of around 250 tons of paint sludge in 2022 at our powertrain plant, Szentgotthard (Hungary), several improvements of cleaning activities led to an annual reduction of oily grinding sludge of approximately seven tons annually and the packaging waste was reduced by approximately 28 tons annually.\n  - At our vehicle plant, Mirafiori (Italy), we analyzed whether our suppliers can switch from cardboard packaging to returnable containers. More than 50% of the analyzed suppliers were able to switch to returnable packaging, reducing our waste by approximately 250 tons annually.\n\u25cf At our vehicle plant, Zaragoza (Spain), we started a project to eliminate individual cardboard separators from the rear bumper, increasing the capacity of the container and reducing the amount of cardboard by approximately 29 tons annually.\n\n\u25cf At our powertrain plant, Termoli (Italy), by extending the service life of the filters in the emulsion system, we saved 49 tons of hazardous waste from filter materials. Additionally, there were technical improvements in the finishing process, the grinding sludge was reduced by approximately 60 tons annually.\n\n\u25cf Since 2019, packaging in our assembly plant in Trnava (Slovakia), transport capacity has been analyzed and optimized. This has increased the number of parts transported per packaging unit without reducing the quality requirements for the packaging. Overall, this initiative has reduced packaging waste per vehicle by approximately 1 kg over the last 3 years. The improvements implemented in 2022 resulted in a reduced waste volume of approximately 105 tons.\n\nIncreasing reuse: at our powertrain plant, Szentgotthard (Hungary), we collect condensed emulsion in our technological exhaust air systems and the emulsions from the chip centrifuge. This collected emulsion is reused in the central coolant system. This emulsion reuse reduced our waste by approximately 46 tons annually.\n\nFrom one way packaging to no packaging: at our Plastics Component PCMA plant San Benigno (Italy), the delivery of the molding material for the products was changed from one-way one-off cardboard boxes on wooden pallets to direct truck delivery to the storage silos. By changing the delivery, approximately 21 tons of cardboard waste and approximately 27 tons of wood waste are reduced each year.\n\n6.4.4.2.2 Initiatives to improve waste recovery\n\nImproving waste segregation and recovery:\n\n\u25a0 at our warehouse in Bochum (Germany), we identified third parties that reuse wooden one-way pallets as spare parts for other pallets, that we previously disposed of as incineration with energy recovery. Up to 360 tons of wood annually that was previously incinerated can now be recycled. At our component production and warehouse facility in Vesoul (France), we found a solution for approximately 200 tons of formally landfilled municipal waste which is now disposed of as incineration with energy recovery.\n\n\u25a0 at our Dundee Engine Plant (U.S.), the general refuse and filter media was being sent to landfill. All general refuse and filter media was switched over to waste-to-energy allowing our Dundee plant to become zero landfill (100% Recovery) and diverting approximately 120 tons of trash as well as approximately 20 tons of filter media annually.\n### 6.4.5 Detailed Key Performance Indicators\n\n#### 6.4.5.1 Total waste generated from operation by disposal type measured in tons\n\n| Waste

information Annual Report\n6.5 Control of industrial discharges and nuisances\n\n6.5.1 CONTEXT AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\nCSR issue/challenge #17: Control of industrial discharges and nuisances\n\nStellantis understands that the automotive production processes use substances and processes that generate air emissions that could potentially affect air quality, natural environments and the quality of life in the surrounding neighborhoods of our plants. In particular, we monitor and control air emissions such as Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), that are derived from solvent use in paint processes, Sulfur Dioxide (SO\u2082), Nitrogen Oxides (NO\u2093) and Particulate Matter, that are the result of combustion processes (for example, burning fossil fuels for energy generation or heating purposes) and Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) that leaked from refrigeration and air conditioning equipment in our plants and offices. Nuisances could also occur in the form of noise or odor generated by industrial processes or accidental releases of chemicals with potential impact on other environmental media such as soil or water, or on human health.\n\nWe are implementing processes to limit and reduce air emissions, including the post-processing of residual emissions, noise and odor level monitoring and substitution of hazardous substances with non-hazardous ones where possible.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nWe are committed to compliance with environmental regulations in the areas that we operate. Stellantis is developing and implementing processes for consistent improvement and for controlling its environmental impact. Stellantis strives for zero VOC emissions through improvements of treatment processes.\n\n6.5.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\nCommitment scoreboard\n\n| CSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE | VISION/AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | RESULTS |\n|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|---------|\n| Control of industrial discharges and nuisances | Implement state of the art technical solutions to prevent industrial activities from causing nuisances to the surrounding areas | Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions from paint shops normalized (g/m\u00b2 painted) | Short-term: 2022: 24.25 g/m\u00b2 painted | 24.25 g/m\u00b2 painted |\n| | | | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan): 2030: 25 g/m\u00b2 painted | 24.95 g/m\u00b2 painted |\n| | | | Long-term: 2050: ambition of 0 g/m\u00b2 painted | |\n6.5.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n6.5.3.1 Risks\nStellantis identified some risks and has implemented several actions and initiatives to mitigate them.\n\n- Potential business risks:\n  - Stellantis is dependent on future technologies to accomplish the aspirational goal of zero VOC emissions in painting processes.\n  - Today, 35% of our paint shops use solvent-based paints and are subject to stringent regulatory emission limits. High production volumes allocated to these plants increase our global VOC emissions. To convert existing solvent-based paint into water-based paint, we estimated an investment cost of several hundred million euros.\n  - Increasing demands by authorities for provisions and guarantees to cover clean-up costs of end-of-life real estate assets. Higher premiums to cover the insurance costs of accidental spills and releases.\n\n- Potential operational risks:\n  - Meeting more stringent regulatory emission factors could require adapting operational processes or replacing materials.\n  - Reducing VOC emissions by combustion, determines increased exhaust gases and energy usage. Such combustion processes negatively contribute to CO\u2082 emissions and also increases NO\u2093 emissions.\n  - New residential development surrounding our facilities may be impacted by noise, light or other emissions.\n\n- Potential reputational risks:\n  - Failure to meet customer expectations of minimal effect on the environment from our products and production.\n  - Accidental releases may cause significant legal and clean-up costs, loss of trust by neighboring communities, damage to company reputation, brand image and sales.\n\n6.5.3.2 Opportunities\nStellantis identified opportunities and has implemented several actions to seize them.\n\n- Opportunities for the business:\n  - Opportunities to work with suppliers to develop and test new painting methods and equipment, such as low overspray technology.\n  - Minimize the risk for accidental releases by implementing pollution control measures such as an equipment maintenance and repair program, enhancing operational procedures in our environmental management systems.\nOpportunities for operational management:\n\n- Implement efficiency measures and process optimization including improved cleaning processes and batch painting which reduce usage of solvents and produce less emissions.\n- Reduction of solvent emissions by using solvent-free or low solvents.\n- Replace manual painting operations with automatic painting processes, which use less paint and generate less overspray, thereby reducing VOC emissions and paint sludge.\n- Limit the nuisances to people and the environment by managing the chemicals used on site e.g., control or eliminate substances that causes odor nuisances.\n\nOpportunities for reputation:\n\n- Enhance relationships, social acceptance to operate and brand value by maintaining or improving air and soil quality and reducing noise and odor in the neighboring communities.\n- Demonstrate transparency by disclosing information to authorities and to the public in case of accidental harmful releases in the environment.\n\n6.5.4 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\n6.5.4.1 Reducing air emissions\n\nBesides industrial Carbon Dioxide (CO\u2082) emissions, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), Sulfur Dioxide (SO\u2082), Nitrogen Oxides (NO\u2093), Particulate Matter (PM), and Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) are air emissions generated by Stellantis facilities. These emissions result from the usage of chemical products in painting operations, surface treatment activities, foundry processes, dust collectors, and from burning fossil fuels in heating and VOC abatement processes.\n\nReducing Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions\n\nVOCs require environmental controls to reduce the impact on air quality. Some VOCs are harmful to human beings and the environment, some come from natural sources and others are human made. In most jurisdictions, regulations are in place to limit and control industrial VOC emissions.\n\nThe majority of VOC emissions generated in our manufacturing operations come from vehicle painting operations or surface treatment processes. VOCs are significant constituents in the formulation of paints and cleaning materials used in paint shops. Even though paint shops using waterborne base coats contribute to our VOC emissions, paint shops with solvent-based base coats play the most important role. Approximately, 35% of our paint shops use solvent-based base coats. When high production volumes are allocated to these plants, they become main drivers for our global VOC emissions.\nIn 2022, we emitted 24.25 g/m\u00b2 painted surface versus 24.95 g/m\u00b2 in 2021 or 2.71 kg/vehicle produced versus 2.82 in 2021. This represents a reduction of 0.7 g/m\u00b2 versus 2021.\n\nThe best performing vehicle assembly plant was Sterling Heights Assembly Plant with 5.25 g/m\u00b2. However, 60% of our vehicle assembly plants performed better than our medium-term target of 25 g/m\u00b2.\n\nWe focus our actions on reducing VOC emissions, efficiency measures, reducing consumption of paints and their solvent content, implementing low-emission technologies and installing air treatment equipment for incinerating VOC. Measures for recycling and reuse of solvents for cleaning purposes are ongoing.\n\nThe following selected examples illustrate our efforts to reduce VOC emissions:\n\n- At our Warren truck assembly plant (U.S.), we reduced VOC emissions by refurbishing a paint coating line utilizing new technologies, recirculating booth air, improved VOC abatement equipment and shutting down three old paint lines. These measures reduced VOC emissions at the facility by 19.58 g/m\u00b2. This reduction is a 67% improvement from 2021.\n\n- At our assembly plant in Luton (UK), we improved the piping system for the recovery of solvents contaminated during the color change cleaning process. This resulted in a more efficient waste solvent recovery and lowered the evaporation of the solvent. The piping system project cost was approximately \u20ac 100,000, and together with some smaller improvements in material consumption and cleaning processes allowed the site to reduce their VOC emissions by approximately 4.5 g/m\u00b2.\n\n- In the paint shop of our vehicle assembly plant in Madrid (Spain), we completed the change from manual interior painting of the base coat lines to robotic applicators. This automated process, combined with the optimization of the purging and cleaning of the application robots and the reduction of solvent consumption for the cleaning processes in the paint shop, reduces VOC emissions by up to 8 g/m\u00b2 compared to 2021.\n\nStellantis invests in research and development for new paints and paint technologies. Progress has been made to increase the solid content of the white paint on commercial vehicles, which allows the reduction of the amount of solvent and decreases VOC emissions.\n\n**Reducing emissions of Sulfur Dioxide (SO\u2082), Nitrogen Oxides (NO\u2093) and Particulate Matter (PM)**\n\nBoth gases, SO\u2082 and NO\u2093, are present in our atmosphere and have natural and industrial origins. Human-made sources are any kind of combustion process, e.g., burning of fossil fuels. The gases can form acid rain, which negatively affects ecosystems such as, forests and lakes, as well as man-made structures like buildings and statues. Therefore, industrial SO\u2082 and NO\u2093 emissions are regulated in most jurisdictions.\n\nParticulate Matter (PM) is solid or liquid particles that is measured in micrometers (1,000 times smaller than millimeter) and suspended into the air. PM may come from natural or human-made sources. PM can cause harm to human health, and the suspended particles can affect the amount of incoming and reflected radiation in the earth\u2019s atmosphere and therefore influence our climate.\nIn our Manufacturing facilities, we operate different types of combustion installations using fossil fuels, such as ovens for drying painted parts, thermal oxidizers for reducing VOC emissions, boilers for heating buildings, and cogeneration plants for heat and electricity generation. In our Retail activities these emissions are linked with heating or air conditioning.\n\nIn 2022, our SO\u2082 emissions were a total of 218 tons, NO\u2093 emissions were a total of 1,346 tons and PM was 98 tons. The SO\u2082 emissions increased by 108 tons, NO\u2093 emissions decreased by 118 tons and PM decreased by 16 tons compared to 2021. The main reasons for the reduction were a result of the energy saving activities at all sites. The increase of the SO\u2082 emissions is due to the extended emission reporting from our foundries.\n\n**Reducing Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) emissions**\n\nOzone Depleting Substances (ODS) are a group of chemical substances that have the ability to react with ozone and negatively impact the ozone layer of the stratosphere. The ozone layer prevents harmful wavelengths of ultraviolet light to reach the earth\u2019s surface which cause harm to human beings, vegetation and animals. Since the Montreal Protocol in 1987 and the subsequent revisions of this international treaty, production of certain groups of ODS have been banned, and their usage was phased-out or will phase-out within the next few years.\n\nMost ODS are used as refrigerants, solvents or blowing agents which makes them available in process and air conditioning equipment at our manufacturing facilities, offices and retail sites, as well as in the air conditioning systems in our products. Stellantis monitors ODS emissions during ODS-containing equipment maintenance or service activities and leak checks. ODS emissions are recorded in the event of an incident of an equipment installation. In 2022, our ODS emissions were in total at 52 kg of CFC-11 equivalent. This represents an increase 13 kg compared to 2021.\n\n**6.5.4.2 Reducing other industrial discharges and nuisances**\n\n**Reducing chemicals**\n\nStellantis strives to manage the usage of hazardous chemicals in a rigorous manner. When a new chemical product is introduced at a plant, it is assessed. The assessment includes checking the nature and acceptability of the health and environmental impacts. This assessment either results in a ban of the product or acceptance for use with risk prevention requirements. Safety data sheets are developed for authorized products and access to the information is provided to employees.\n\nIn addition to the approval processes, structural measures such as building retention basins or using above ground pipe systems versus underground piping to carry liquids, can limit the impact in case of accidental releases. To minimize chemical risks, supervisors or other functions conduct checks of environmental procedures and installations during site walks and inspections as part of Stellantis Production System or during ISO 14001 audits. In addition, inventories of chemical products in stock enables the facility to limit on-site volumes.\nReducing other forms of nuisances in local communities, such as noise or odor\n\nNoise and odor caused by our operations may cause nuisances to our neighbors including residential areas located close to our facilities. We seek to address the potential risks by conducting impact studies and action plans potentially associated with our manufacturing facilities. The studies assess the sensitivity of residential areas surrounding the plants with criteria such as sound levels, odors or traffic. When new chemical products are introduced at a plant, the components are reviewed to limit issues such as odor. In most jurisdictions, studies are required for new facilities or as part of major site redevelopment and building projects. Usually, these studies are subject to public disclosure and approval by the authorities.\n\nAvoiding and remediating soil contamination\n\nGiven the long history of some industrial facilities, soil impacts may be present at our sites. Historic contamination may be caused by leakages from underground storage tanks, underground pipes or spills. We conduct site investigations as part of ongoing initiatives, site acquisition or divestment projects, and at the request of regulators. The initial site investigation step usually includes record reviews and interviews to identify potential areas of concern. In the following steps, if necessary, onsite investigations may include the analysis of soil, surface water or groundwater, or soil gas samples in order to determine the presence and extent of potential contamination. In some cases, this onsite investigation may consist of several phases to delineate the extent of the contamination. Depending on the results, measures such as monitoring, containment or remediation activities are implemented.

We are aware that there are water-stressed areas around the world where less-efficient water use may have adverse social and environmental effects due to reduced water availability, quality and disruption of ecosystems.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nAs a Global Compact member, Stellantis fully adheres to the sustainability development goals for clean water management. Furthermore, Stellantis obtained ISO 14001 certification for the vast majority of our plants and as such the Company is developing and implementing processes for improvement of water management.\n\nStellantis is committed to promote responsible water stewardship to strive for zero water withdrawal in industrial activities and to prevent any pollutant discharge. Where our plants are in areas with identified water stress, Stellantis is committed to implement extra water management measures.\n\n6.6.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\n| CSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE | VISION/AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | RESULTS |\n|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|---------|\n| Sustainable water management in manufacturing | Promote responsible water stewardship to strive for zero water withdrawal by water recycling in industrial activities | Total water withdrawn normalized (m\u00b3/vehicle produced) | Short-term: 2025: 3.5 m\u00b3/vehicle produced | 2022: 4.56 m\u00b3/vehicle produced |\n| | | | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan): 2030: 3.0 m\u00b3/vehicle produced | 2021: 4.77 m\u00b3/vehicle produced |\n| | | | Long-term: 2038: 2.0 m\u00b3/vehicle produced in water-stressed areas | |\n| | | | | 2050: 1.0 m\u00b3/vehicle produced |\n\nGRI 3-3\nGRI 303-3\nGRI 303-4\nGRI 303-5\nGRI 413-2\n\nSustainable water management in manufacturing\n6.6.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n6.6.3.1 Risk\n\nStellantis identified some risks and has implemented several actions and initiatives to mitigate them.\n\n- Potential risk for the business:\n  - Developing manufacturing facilities in water-stressed areas may affect the local water use and the livelihood in the communities, leading to potential conflicts and water usage restrictions for our facilities.\n  - Increased flood risk due to extreme weather events affecting facilities located close to rivers, in river basins or other geographical locations.\n  - Water scarcity is an emerging global environmental topic and its affects are not fully experienced or understood in every region. This constraint may lead to an underestimation of the severity of the issue. Investment costs versus operational costs may make it difficult to implement new water saving technology and processes within manufacturing facilities in many regions.\n\n- Potential risks for operational management:\n  - Water shortage may lead to increased water supply costs, reduction of production volume or disruption of operations, leading certain governments to impose more stringent requirements for obtaining and maintaining permits for water withdrawal. There are some facilities that need to change current operational permits to maintain operations.\n  - More stringent regulatory targets on pollution control of wastewater discharge are causing us to adapt our production processes or substitute raw materials, which may lead to increased cost for water treatment.\n  - Extreme temperatures and droughts can cause the rise in temperatures of rivers and streams. When the water temperatures exceed the temperatures allowed by regulators, we may be restricted from discharging cooling waters from cogeneration power plants which could impact production.\n\n- Potential reputational risk:\n  - Water management and target setting requires a site-specific approach. The challenge is to meet stakeholder expectations with customized actions based the local water constraints.\n  - Being held responsible by the general public or neighboring communities for exploiting or polluting shared water resources with our manufacturing facilities.\n  - Being held responsible for increasing the water stress in regions where we develop new facilities. This may result in impact to brand value, customer defection and loss of profit.\n6.6.3.2 Opportunities\n\nStellantis identified opportunities and has implemented several actions to seize them.\n\n- **Opportunities for the business:**\n  - Adopt best practices and public scientific data and tools to assess water risks for facilities.\n  - Direct investments toward facilities located in water-stressed areas or projects that have the biggest impact on water by reducing risk and increasing performance.\n  - Design out pollutants from materials or processes to minimize water treatment and associated costs.\n\n- **Opportunities for operational management:**\n  - Implement technology and processes that require less water for new facility design or facility redevelopment projects. Enable recycling or reuse of water to reduce dependency on the water resources may save water supply and clean-up costs. In existing facilities, the deployment of best practices shared amongst the manufacturing plants support efficiency improvements in water usage.\n  - Adopt efficiency measures to reduce water usage and wastewater treatment may lead to less energy usage, and therefore have a positive impact on operational costs, as well as on CO\u2082 emissions combating climate change.\n  - Implement internal water quality standards and clean-up goals to anticipate and address stringent targets set by regulators. In addition, improved water quality offers more options for reusing water.\n\n- **Opportunities for reputation:**\n  - Maintain or improve water availability for others in locations of high water-stressed areas, enhance community relations, social acceptance to operate and increase brand value.\n  - Proactive disclosure of information regarding our sustainable water management initiatives, outreach activities with the neighboring community or education initiatives on water issues.\n\n6.6.4 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\n6.6.4.1 Main achievements on water management\n\n- **Water withdrawn**\n\n  In 2022, we withdrew in total 26,661 thousand m\u00b3 of water versus 27,540 thousand m\u00b3 of water in 2021, of which 26,285 thousand m\u00b3 versus 27,142 thousand m\u00b3 of water in 2021 were withdrawn by Manufacturing sites and 376 thousand m\u00b3 versus 398 thousand m\u00b3 of water in 2021 for Retail activities. The sources for our water supply were comprised of third-party or municipal water at 62%, surface water at 15% and groundwater at 23%.\nStellantis does not abstract seawater, all water withdrawn is considered freshwater. In addition, 35,673 thousand m\u00b3 of water from surface waters were abstracted for cooling purposes at our own cogeneration plants.\n\n### Annual water withdrawal by source\n\n| Source                        | 2022 | 2021 |\n|-------------------------------|------|------|\n| Third-party / Municipal Water | 62%  | 61%  |\n| Surface Water                 | 15%  | 15%  |\n| Groundwater                   | 23%  | 24%  |\n\nThe normalized water withdrawn for Manufacturing activities in 2022 was 4.56 m\u00b3 per vehicle produced versus 4.77 m\u00b3 per vehicle produced in 2021. This represents a reduction of 0.21 m\u00b3 per vehicle produced.\n\nOur Manufacturing facilities vary widely in terms of plant size, production volume, operations performed, technologies installed, age of facility, all of which can influence water use and treatment. We analyze the performance of the best performing plants to identify and share best practices.\n\nThe best performing vehicle assembly plants were Maserati Modena with a water withdrawal of 0.77 m\u00b3 per vehicle produced and Tychy with a water withdrawal of 0.86 m\u00b3 per vehicle produced. However, 42% of our vehicle assembly plants performed better than our medium-term target of 3.0 m\u00b3 per vehicle produced.\n\nThe majority of water withdrawn is used in Manufacturing activities for the following processes:\n\n- vehicle painting\n- cooling\n- cleaning processes\n- sprinkler systems\n- sanitation and hygiene\n- drinking water.\n\nThe majority of water withdrawn for Retail activities is used for the following processes:\n\n- sanitation and hygiene\n- drinking water\n- car washing in dealerships and workshops.\nWater discharged and pollution control\n\nIn 2022, we discharged in total 18,699 thousand m\u00b3 wastewater versus 19,148 thousand m\u00b3 in 2021, of which 18,323 thousand m\u00b3 versus 19,027 thousand m\u00b3 in 2021 was discharged by Manufacturing sites, and 376 thousand m\u00b3 versus 121 thousand m\u00b3 in 2021 for our Retail activities. We discharged 67% into third-party / municipal industrial sewer systems, and 33% into surface waters (as in 2021). The wastewater discharge into the groundwater was negligible. Stellantis did not directly discharge any wastewater into seawater or oceans.\n\nWater discharge destination and volumes\n\n| Destination          | 2022 | 2021 |\n|----------------------|------|------|\n| Third-party / Municipal water | 67%  | 67%  |\n| Surface water        | 33%  | 33%  |\n| Groundwater          | 0%   | 0%   |\n\nLike other industries that are using water for their production, vehicle manufacturing processes have some impact on water quality. One of the impacts is from the presence of metals from processes and materials used for surface treatment. Typical heavy metals are Cadmium (Cd), Chromium (Cr), Copper (Cu), Nickel (Ni), Lead (Pb) and Zinc (Zn). In addition, physical chemistry parameters such as Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Suspended Matter (SM) are typical water quality impacts from manufacturing operations of whatever kind. Therefore, most of the plants monitor their wastewater discharge for these water quality factors as outlined within their operational permit requirements.\n\nMany jurisdictions have implemented regulations to control the discharge of heavy metals. These regulations are regularly revised to increase the list of controlled substances or to further decrease emission limit values. These modifications are reflected in changes to the operational permits of our plants, which also specify the frequency of measurements and controls.\n\nMeeting legal and permit requirements is a given, however, we aim to discharge wastewater with regulated constituents at levels below legal limits. As such, we regularly measure and analyze the quality of wastewater produced to obtain a comprehensive view of the impact on water quality. All production plants active in 2022 were serviced by either an internal or external wastewater treatment plant.\nHeavy metal loads\n\n| Metal   | 2022  | 2021  |\n|---------|-------|-------|\n| Cadmium | 32 kg | 63 kg |\n| Chromium| 665 kg| 253 kg|\n| Copper  | 287 kg| 1,049 kg|\n| Lead    | 178 kg| 117 kg|\n| Nickel  | 3,972 kg| 11,702 kg|\n| Zinc    | 5,737 kg| 10,096 kg|\n\nChemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Suspended Matter (SM)\n\n| Parameter | 2022  | 2021  |\n|-----------|-------|-------|\n| BOD       | 1,474 tons| 1,376 tons|\n| COD       | 3,577 tons| 3,316 tons|\n| SM        | 439 tons| 439 tons|\n\nThe loads shown in the charts above include heavy metal loads for Stellantis plants in 2022. The loads were calculated with concentrations measured at the discharge monitoring points of our sites.\n\n- **Water consumption**\n\nWater consumption is defined as water withdrawn minus water discharged. In 2022, we consumed a total amount of water of 7,962 thousand m\u00b3 versus 8,392 thousand m\u00b3 in 2021, of which 7,962 thousand m\u00b3 versus 8,115 thousand m\u00b3 in 2021 at manufacturing facilities. The water consumption at our retail sites is negligible.\n\nWater discharged could increase or decrease because of rainwater, consumption or evaporation from operations that have exposed water functions, such as water-cooling towers. Some older plants do not have a separate sewer system for the collection and discharge of rainwater versus process wastewater or sanitary wastewater. In these cases, the municipal or Stellantis wastewater treatment plant must treat all such water discharge volumes, increasing its costs and our tax expenditures.\n6.6.4.2 Main initiatives on water management\n\nAs outlined in section 6.6.3, the main two water risks impacting operational management are related to water shortage resulting in increasing pressure of authorities to reduce water withdrawal as well as establishing more stringent discharge values to secure water quality. We apply best practices to support plants with the reduction of water usage and improvement of water quality.\n\nFor the water stress risk evaluation, the Company uses the Baseline scenario (2019) of the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas and for future risk evaluation the Business as usual scenario 2030. Water stress is an indicator of competition for water resources and is defined informally as the ratio of demand for water by human society divided by available water. In 2022, 35 plants were located in a high or extremely high water-stressed area versus 36 in 2021 (according to the World Resources Institute Aqueduct \u201cbaseline water stress\u201d indicator) for a total water withdrawal of 7,361 thousand m$^3$ versus 7,243 thousand m$^3$ in 2021 and 4,849 thousand m$^3$ versus 5,093 thousand m$^3$ in 2021 of water discharge. For future risk evaluation Business as usual scenario 2030 44 plants are affected.\n\nSome examples of successful initiatives to reduce water usage or improve water quality:\n\n**Avoid or reduce losses and leakages:**\n- At our vehicle assembly plant in Cassino (Italy) we used ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to identify leakages in the underground pipes of the fire-fighting system. The leakage repair enabled us to save approximately 43,200 m$^3$ per year.\n- At our vehicle assembly plant in Luton (UK), a leak detection survey and repair of the underground pipes was conducted that resulted in a water saving of approximately 17,000 m$^3$ annually.\n\n**Cooling water reuse:**\n- A new cooling water recirculation system was installed in our Teksid Aluminum foundry plant in Carmagnola (Italy) which results in a partial flow of the cooling water that was previously used in once-through cooling is now recirculated. About 40% of the previously used cooling water is reused in the circuit, resulting in annual savings of around 490,000 m$^3$.\n\n**Process improvement:**\n- At our vehicle assembly plant in Atessa (Italy), we improved the steam generation system by reducing steam losses, which is associated with a reduction in water makeup and enabled us to save approximately 27,000 m$^3$ per year and in addition reduces the energy consumption by approximately 1,100 MWh annually.\n- At our vehicle assembly plant in Mirafiori (Italy), we use recirculated wastewater from the wastewater treatment plant in the spray booth dust abatement system, instead of fresh water. This process saved approximately 10,000 m$^3$ water annually.\n\n$^2$ The 2021 water discharge figures have been corrected.\nAt our Warren Truck Assembly Plant (U.S.), we reduced water consumption per vehicle by 41%, through several measures in the phosphate process in the two paint shops. This included optimization of spraying systems, downtime curtailment improvements, automated rinse spray control systems and tank level control adjustments. This results in a forecasted water reduction of approximately 500,000 m\u00b3 in 2023.\n\nAt our powertrain plant in Szentgotthard (Hungary) we implemented in Reverse Osmosis (RO) technology as ion-free water instead of ion-exchanged water. This and other activities at the plant resulted in water savings of approximately 972 m\u00b3 annually.\n\n### 6.6.5 Detailed Key Performance Indicators\n\n#### 6.6.5.1 Annual water withdrawn\u00b2 by

Demand; COD = Chemical Oxygen Demand; SM = Suspended Matter (TSS = Total Suspended Solid)\n6.7 Protection of biodiversity\n\n6.7.1 CONTEXT AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\nCSR issue/challenge #19: Protection of biodiversity\n\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Risks Report 2020 ranks biodiversity loss and damage to the ecosystem as one of the top five risks of likelihood and impact in the coming ten years. It is closely linked with other top risks identified such as climate change, extreme weather and natural disasters highlighting the complexity of nature, and the volatile ways of impacting us as human beings and industrial corporations.\n\nEven though the protection of biodiversity is a complex process and the impact of the Company\u2019s manufacturing operations on biodiversity is relatively limited, Stellantis has implemented dedicated measures aimed at further minimizing this issue, such as the commitment to a progressive approach to reduce impacts first, then restore and finally recover biodiversity. New operations on protected areas are prohibited. When Stellantis already operates in such areas, it applies mitigation hierarchy aimed at minimizing impact, including offsets for any remaining residual impact. Biodiversity protection activities at our sites are focused on biodiversity inventories, awareness campaigns for employees, and other stakeholders such as the community surrounding our manufacturing facilities, and working with students, all for preservation of natural habitats near its areas of operations.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nStellantis plants endeavor to ensure biodiversity knowledge and preventative actions relevant to their geographic scope along with the development of biodiversity on the related sites by preserving natural habitats and by implementing projects. Stellantis is currently assessing different biodiversity management tools in order to meet the upcoming requirements stemming from the European Taxonomy legislative proposal.\n6.7.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\nCommitment scoreboard\n\n| CSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE | VISION/AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | RESULTS |\n|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|---------|\n| Protection of biodiversity | Ensure the development of biodiversity on our sites by preserving natural habitats | Percentage of plants that have done a RENATU evaluation and are developing biodiversity projects | Short-term: 2022 | 2021 |\n|                      |                 |                | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan): 2025: 60% | 2030: 100% | 2050: strategic partnership for global biodiversity program. | 29% | 26% |\n\n6.7.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n6.7.3.1 Risks\n\nStellantis identified some risks and has implemented several actions and initiative to mitigate them.\n\n- Potential risks for the business:\n  - Dependency of business on natural resources such as air, soil or water for its direct operations or indirect supply chain. According to the New Nature Economy Report 2020 issued by World Economic Forum, the automotive industry\u2019s dependency on nature is assessed to be low to medium for its direct gross value added, whereas the gross value added of the automotive industry\u2019s supply chain was assessed to be more dependent on nature and therefore referred to as a \u201chidden dependency.\u201d\n  - Loss in nature causing socio-economic instability in countries of operation resulting in disrupted business continuity or loss in markets.\n\n- Potential risk for operational management:\n  - Regulatory and legal risk of increased governmental actions on biodiversity are expected, such as restrictions on land usage or usage of ecosystem services. Potential increase in taxes, insurance premiums, new trade directives or reforming subsidies and increased disclosure requirements may be expected. Similarly, potential decrease in property sale and lease income is possible due to use and deed restrictions.\n  - Climate change causing loss in natural habitats such as forests that were served as important buffer areas during extreme weather events may lead to the potential for severe impact on business continuity.\n\u25cf Value of real estate may be endangered by invasive species or diseases, causing costs for removal, pest control, subsequent remedy measures and potential legal proceedings if surrounding areas are affected.\n\nPotential reputational risk:\n\u25cf Being held responsible by customers or the general public for loss in biodiversity from building new or expanding facilities, by materials or technology used in products or sourcing of raw material in its supply chain, and emissions from our products. This may result in a negative impact to our brands\u2019 value, customer defection, loss of profit and conflicts with neighboring community.\n\n6.7.3.2 Opportunities\nStellantis identified opportunities and has implemented several actions to seize them.\n\nOpportunities for the business:\n\u25cf Corporate land areas can be an important contribution to climate action, for example as a source of carbon sequestration or increased resilience for the human-made, built and natural environments.\n\u25cf Major infrastructure projects or expansion of existing facilities are highly dependent on stakeholder acceptance. Integrating conservation measures as part of the site selection and implementation can help with adding value to neighboring communities and building acceptance with stakeholders.\n\u25cf Work with supply chain to reduce indirect impact on biodiversity loss and reduce hidden dependency of the automotive industry.\n\nOpportunities for operational management:\n\u25cf Stellantis conservation and education activities contribute to maintaining a social acceptance to operate.\n\u25cf Conservation measures may also add value to the real estate property or may increase its resistance toward climate change related extreme weather such as droughts, floods, etc. besides providing a more attractive environment for employees.\n\nOpportunities for company reputation:\n\u25cf Stellantis conservation practices on corporate land demonstrate a long-term commitment to quality habitat for wildlife, conservation education and community outreach initiatives.\n\u25cf Talent attraction and retention by offering employee biodiversity engagement activities that meet a variety of needs including work-life balance, health and wellness and providing value to the communities in which Stellantis operates.\n\u25cf Communicating a company\u2019s efforts to further biodiversity and sustainability is an important driver to gaining value to a company\u2019s social acceptance to operate and positive brand value.\n6.7.4 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nStellantis uses the tool RENATU to evaluate biodiversity at green areas located at its production facilities. RENATU is a self-assessment tool developed to evaluate the biodiversity of industrial sites or developed areas. It was developed by the University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne and has been designed and scientifically validated within the framework of the Infrastructure de Transport Terrestre ECOsyst\u00e8me et Paysage (ITTECOP) program of the French Ministry of the Ecological Transition and Solidarity.\n\nThe RENATU indicator consists of 11 categories that address items such as: invasive species, various vegetation layers, the presence of microhabitats, nesting sites and distance to biodiversity reservoirs. The assessment is conducted by site walkthroughs and data analysis. Each category is rated to determine the total score.\n\nIn 2021, Stellantis started to roll-out RENATU at its production facilities. In 2022, 89% of Stellantis production facilities have conducted a RENATU evaluation, the average score obtained was 34.64 points (out of 55 points maximum) with 11.39 points achieved by the lowest scoring plant and 52.88 points by the best scoring plant. Opportunities for improving green areas to attract more biodiversity remain subject to plant specific situations.\n\nHowever, by evaluating the undeveloped areas within the plant, the main purpose for using RENATU is to raise awareness for biodiversity issues on site, to enable a simplified assessment and monitoring, and to encourage developing ideas for preserving or improving biodiversity at the green spots of the industrial facilities.\n\nWe defined our approach towards biodiversity implemented projects. 29% of Stellantis production facilities has conducted a RENATU evaluation and implemented a biodiversity project- a solid base for growth in the next years. This represents an increase of 3% versus 2021.\n\nMost of Stellantis production facilities are located in suburban industrial areas. However 64 plants are located less than 5 km away from a nature protected area. Stellantis also has a historical presence in territories that later became natural protected areas. For those areas, Stellantis operates with consideration of the surrounding environment, striving to preserve and avoid, as much as possible, further expansion of its operations.\n\nWe developed biodiversity projects that involve activities such as restoration, conservation or monitoring measures. To ensure we develop projects meaningful for the environment, we engaged third-party experts who helped us plan, verify or certify our projects. Third-party experts include universities or other scientific research institutes, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) engaged in biodiversity or nature protection, professional biodiversity consultants or local regulators.\n\nStellantis works with Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC) for biodiversity project certification. In 2022, we had 17 certified sites located in Canada, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. The Stellantis U.S. headquarters and Technology Center in Michigan (U.S.) was awarded a WHC certified Gold status for its biodiversity program. And there are 16 certified production facilities three of which are WHC certified Silver.\n\nFor an overview table refer to 6.7.5\n\nEtobicoke Casting Plant urban forest recognized by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources\n6.7.4.1 Initiatives to support and restore biodiversity\n\nIn 2022, we had 59 biodiversity projects implemented. The following summaries represent examples of Stellantis biodiversity projects:\n\n**Etobicoke Casting Plant urban forest recognized:**\n- An urban forest tucked in behind the Etobicoke Casting Plant (U.S.) has been recognized for its biodiversity and employee stewardship in a new, special report from the Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC). This urban forest was created on an area of 10 hectares where excavated material gradually piled up, creating a space with varied topography, including hills and valleys, an elevated, grassy plateau and marshlands and waterbodies. A concentrated effort by the Environmental Health and Safety team to conserve and care for the urban forest began last decade. Employees cordoned off the area using fencing that prevented trespassing while allowing wildlife to enter. In 2016, the team stopped mowing the plateau and seeded it with native wildflowers including milkweed. They also planted 1,200 coniferous seedlings, including spruce, cedar and pine trees, to expand the wooded parts of the habitat. Recent monitoring data indicates that trees are now quickly establishing, and that the habitat\u2019s no-mow policy has allowed an ecotone of shrubs to form between the grassland and wooded area. Rabbits, squirrels, possums and more than ten species of birds have been observed in the forest, and the habitat has also been recognized as a Managed Urban Forest by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources.\n\n**Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC) projects:**\n- Saltillo Truck Assembly Plant has become the first Stellantis facility to receive Wildlife Habitat Council Conservation Certification in Mexico. The Silver Certification was awarded based on the biodiversity initiatives implemented at the Plant associated with reptiles, dotted squirrels and environmental education. A biodiversity inventory was completed at the Plant to understand the variety of species at the Plant and educate employees. In addition, the Plant instituted management protocol for reptiles and habitat preservation and enhancement for the squirrels.\n- Windsor Assembly Plant has been hosting biodiversity events at the Plant since 2009 and has had Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC) Conservation Certification since 2018 with a program designed to enhance the local biodiversity by planning and maintain an urban forest project, engaging with employees, their families and the local community by holding photo and artwork contests, cleanup days, community gardens, and naturalization of green spaces in and around the plant. The Plant was also the recipient of the inaugural WHC Ibis Award in 2021. The Ibis Award recognizes a WHC Certified program that has demonstrated resilience of spirit and advancement of conservation despite lockdowns, quarantines and additional government-mandated regulations. The Plant continues to implement new and exciting biodiversity events every year.\n- The assembly plant in Zaragoza, Spain, runs a biodiversity program that has received \u201cSilver\u201d certification by the Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC) in January 2022. The program includes native tree and shrubs planting in three areas at the site, using local species that are adopted to the soil, water and climate conditions in that region. Continuous monitoring proves that the prepared conditions are well suited to provide food and shelter for a wide variety of pollinators and also reptiles, e.g., the Iberian lizard (podarcis hispanica).\nBiodiversity conservation projects:\n\n- The powertrain plant in Tychy, Poland, has created, in collaboration with the Silesian Botanical Garden, a pollinator garden, and is maintaining and enhancing its biodiversity status continuously since a few years. The recent activities include planting several types of native trees and shrubs with edible fruit for birds and installing insect hotels. The project includes awareness-raising of our employees, in providing information about the new plantations, their importance for endangered species of the local habitat, and about feeding birds in winter. The whole concept and architectural design were prepared by specialists from the Silesian Botanical Garden.\n\nUrban Nature Trail project:\n\n- As part of the investment made to build the new Detroit Assembly Complex Mack plant (U.S.), Stellantis made a commitment to support the local community to reduce the impact of the new plant on the neighborhood. This commitment included the installation of 500 trees along streets, parks, and on lots where residents requested; the donation of 100 free rain barrels; and the creation of an \"Urban Nature Trail\" at a stormwater detention area constructed for the project. Stellantis took this unique opportunity to install an interactive walking path with nine stations where individuals can take a break and learn about important aspects like: stormwater management, rain gardens, pollinator gardens, trees, bat habitat, invasive species, and much more. Additionally, the pavilion installed at the park is utilized as an outdoor classroom for local school students in the partnership program with Stellantis.\n\nAmazon Forest Carbon Sink Project\n\nThe Peugeot Brand in partnership with the French National Forestry Office (ONF) is contributing to the PEUGEOT-ONF forest carbon sink project in Mato Grosso, Brazil since 1998. The project involves reforesting of degraded land and restoring biodiversity while studying the relationship between reforestation and the absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The total amount of carbon sequestered by biomass and soil was estimated to be more than 604,000 tons of CO\u2082 equivalent according to the measurement methods of the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS). The VCU are sold under the VCS protocol and revenues are systematically reinvested in the project. Two million trees including more than 50 native species, were reintroduced in a plantation of nearly 2,000 hectares. After 20 years of implementation, ONFI and ONFB teams led an innovative carbon assessment based on remote sensing analysis in order to identify the most relevant areas to be densified by additional plantations. Thanks to this initiative we should be able to reach more than one million tons of CO\u2082 equivalent by 2038. At the heart of the project, an area of 1,800 hectares of virgin forest with high biodiversity value has been devoted to scientific research and placed under the status of Reserva de Patrimonio Natural (RPPN) since 2009.\n\nPart of the project includes a field laboratory, the Fazenda S\u00e3o Nicolau, which welcomes students and researchers from various partner institutions. On-site investigations have led \u2013 amongst other findings \u2013 to the discovery of more than 40 new species, among them a fish named Hyphessobrycon peugeoti and a beetle called Hansreia peugeoti. Numerous academic papers, PhDs and books have been published thanks to the research studies conducted at the Fazenda. These research activities are supervised by a Scientific and Technical Committee composed of Brazilian and international specialists who are acknowledged leaders in the topics addressed in the project.\n### 6.7.5 Detailed Key Performance Indicators\n\n#### 6.7.5.1 Plants located within or near (< 5 km) a natural protected area\n\n| Region          | Plant                        | Plant

ENSURING PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND SUPPORTING A BALANCED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF TERRITORIES\n\nThe automotive industry relies on global complex supply chains. This results in challenges for companies that have established ethical and social standards to ensure that their principles are respected at all stages of the supply chain. Conducting our business with sustainable business practices is a core value at Stellantis. We are firmly committed to act in a socially responsible manner and in line with sustainable practices within Stellantis and at each level of the supply base that includes; ensuring the health and safety of its workforce, prohibiting human rights violations such as child labor and forced labor, and complying with conflict minerals and environmental protection regulations. We encourage the adoption and sharing of sustainable practices among our business partners and suppliers at all levels in the supply chain.\n\nBuilding strong responsible supply chains is an important focus for Stellantis. We use assessment tools that focus on topics such as the environment, labor and human rights, ethics and sustainable procurement. This approach helps develop opportunities within the supplier organizations while minimizing risk and potential reputational damage in the event of a failure in the supply chain. Stellantis monitors compliance with its Code of Conduct and the respect for human rights by its partners and subcontractors and by requiring contractual commitments and ongoing evaluations.\n\nStellantis pays particular attention to redistributing the value created for the benefit of the local communities where the Company operates. We achieve these goals by providing employment opportunities and through our philanthropic actions. Supplier localization is an important strategy. When suppliers are close to Stellantis manufacturing locations it supports the local community and reduces the risk of supply disruption.\n\n7.1 Responsible purchasing practices to support the Company\u2019s development in host territories\n\n7.1.1 CONTEXT AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\nCSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE #20: Responsible purchasing practices to support the Company\u2019s development in host territories\n\nIn order to support the Company\u2019s increasing internationalization and to reduce inequality in terms of economic development in host communities, it is crucial to boost local production close to final markets. Stellantis implements optimization measures such as: identifying local suppliers, supporting them in gaining necessary skills and we encourage current suppliers to relocate closer to our facilities to be aligned to our long-term strategic plans for globalization. This strategy has potential financial implications as it reduces inbound logistics costs, limits customs duties and reduces exposure to exchange rate fluctuations which impact production cost, margins and sales volumes. Reduction of long distance shipping benefits the environment by decreasing CO\u2082 emissions.\nLocal sourcing allows us to better understand the expectations of stakeholders. Some of the expectations include technological solutions which fit the context and constraints within the area; taking advantage of operational proximity with partners; helping to achieve technological, logistical, social and environmental progress and benefiting from increased flexibility in the supply chain.\n\n**Company\u2019s public position**\n\nThe monitoring of CSR issues related to supply chain management is of high importance to Stellantis. Responsibility for managing the supply chain does not end at the Tier 1 level. Our processes and controls are designed to meet the legislative requirements of France\u2019s Duty of Vigilance, EU Conflict Minerals regulation, the U.S. Dodd Frank Act, and the Modern Slavery Act and to extend these principles to the extended supply network including the sub-tier suppliers. The Company seeks to build and sell vehicles that meet customer expectations in alignment with social, environmental and ethical standards, taking inspiration from the United Nations Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights and the International Labour Organization (ILO) rules for human rights such as child labor and forced labor. Stellantis renewed PSA\u2019s membership in the UN Global Compact in 2021, and aligns with the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the United Nations Convention against Corruption. We acknowledge the necessity to comply with rules for the responsible sourcing of materials, such as in the global battery value chain. Through the efforts of all companies the responsibilities are shared through our extended supply network. To make sure that our principles are duly met, we conduct targeted audits where risks are identified. We are vigilant with the implementation of measures within our sphere of influence. We seek to apply all these goals, practices and responsibilities globally, in standard fashion, in all our locations and countries we operate, and with our direct suppliers (Tier 1).\n\n**Involvement in host communities**\n\nThe Company helps to set a context that is favorable to the development of the automotive industry including manufacturers, suppliers and equipment manufacturers in host communities. Working both internationally and locally, the Company is a stakeholder in initiatives to improve the automotive industry profile. A few examples of the work we do are: membership with the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) which provides cross-sector engagement in responsible mineral sourcing, and in France, we are working in coordination with the Automotive Platform (PFA) to define and implement strategies for innovation, employment and skills. Stellantis also contributes revitalization funds to support the development of companies of the future.\n\nIn order to maintain the competitiveness of Stellantis sites, it is key to be able to complement local sourcing with competitive imported materials, while maintaining an environmental and social level playing field.\n7.1.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\nCommitment scoreboard\n\n| CSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE | VISION/AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | RESULTS |\n|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|---------|\n| 20) Responsible purchasing practices to support the Company\u2019s development in host territories | Ensure selection of suppliers based on quality, competitiveness, and social, ethical and environmental standards, hence supporting responsible economic development in host territories | % Annual Purchase Value (APV) purchased from Tier 1 suppliers evaluated on CSR | Short-term: 2022 | 2021 |\n| | | 2025: 90% of APV of direct material (parts) | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan): 2030: 95% of APV of direct material (parts); 75% of APV of indirect material | More than 87% of APV evaluated by Ecovadis | More than 83% by 2 providers (NQC and Ecovadis) |\n| | | Long-term: 2050: Maintain 95% of APV for direct material; 90% APV for indirect material | | 16.1%* | 16.2% |\n| | | Average CSR scores of Stellantis Tier 1 Suppliers assessed by independent third-party vs average CSR scores of all companies assessed by third party | 2025: 15% higher | 2030: keep a positive gap of 15% | 2050: keep a positive gap of 15% |\n\n* We have extended our network with many new, smaller suppliers located in emerging countries.\n\n7.1.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nSuppliers as key participants in the value-creation chain\n\nResponsibility for managing the supply network rests upon each participant of the supply chain. Stellantis aims to generate direct and indirect income and employment opportunities for the communities where the business is located. Faced with growing inequality in the economic development of the regions, it is vital to focus on redistributing the value created by the companies in the local communities in which they operate. We have the opportunity to strengthen our reputation in the territories and markets we operate in, as well as among civil society. When we enhance business opportunities in our host territories we create mutually beneficial situations, which include effects like the reduction of logistics costs and its carbon footprint, as well as employment stability for the area.\n\nStellantis has a direct contractual relationship with more than 2,000 Tier 1 suppliers in direct material. It requires all of them to meet the CSR commitments set out in its Responsible Purchasing Guidelines.\n\nFor more information refer to 7.2.5\nThe Stellantis supply chain has two main distinguishing features:\n\n- it is complex and involves a large number of different participants, starting from receiving a customer order which begins the engagement with our suppliers for materials, goods and services, up to the delivery to our customers worldwide;\n- it must handle a wide diversity of possible combinations, and relies on its ability to successfully supply thousands of component combinations, which depends on successful supplier operations.\n\n1Platinum Group Metals\nSPHERE OF INFLUENCE IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN\n\n- Contractual relationships between Stellantis and its Tier 1 suppliers\n- Sphere of influence of Stellantis in its supply chain\n- Contractual relationships between Stellantis\u2019s Tier 1 suppliers and their own supply chain\n### RISK #1 COMPLEXITY OF EXTENDED SUPPLY CHAINS\n\n**Risk Description**\nStellantis seeks to produce vehicles that are attractive to our global customers based on their diverse values and preferences. Creating vehicles that delight the customer requires working with a complex and extended supply chain. We might face the risk of not being able to procure what we need because of concerns regarding human rights violations, market tensions, geopolitical disruptions, natural disasters and availability of natural resources, among others. The expectations for treatment of people needs to be clear for all levels of the extended supply network.\n\nSome countries have requirements for local sourcing content and Stellantis must address this factor and the issues that may arise. Financial risk for each entity in the supply chain is important to consider. Complex supply chains often require a higher degree of coordination taking into account dependencies between supply chain entities and can be vulnerable to disruption due to the many inputs. One additional risk is the shortage of important raw materials due to geopolitical risks such as military or civilian conflicts and disorder or suddenly changing regulatory requirements becoming more inconsistent from one country or region to another. One other result of this can be local and global pandemic shutdowns that prevent actors at any level of the supply chain to produce goods and services as requested.\n\nNegative impacts are caused by interruptions to the flow of material, whether raw material, parts or services. Failure to apply appropriate supply chain management can have long lasting effects. An approach based on continuous risk assessment with the objective of reducing exposure to risk and improving performance is an important strategy. Stellantis aims to secure its global supply and avoid costly downtime in global production plants.\n\n**Potential Impact**\n- Increased environmental impact for CO\u2082 emissions due to the distance traveled to provide the goods or services;\n- Human Rights violations in the extended supply network, especially in sub-tier sourcing;\n- Disruption of the supply chain due to the\n  - failure or loss of suppliers\n  - raw material shortage both locally and global\n  - pandemic shutdowns or lower tier supplier disruptions;\n- Difficulty in accessing local skills among suppliers\n- Poor quality due to multiple points of input\n- Risk of counterfeiting and misuse of intellectual property could increase with many layers of sub-suppliers\n- Risk of losing parts interchangeability (increased diversity).\n\n**Mitigation Strategy**\n\n**Identify**\n- Code of Conduct and Responsible Sourcing policy\n- Supplier CSR assessments reviewed during sourcing\n- Supply Chain CSR Risk profiling via annual risk mapping activities (including areal and country risk)\n\n**Monitor**\n- Increase transparency of relationships throughout the extended supply network by partnering with service providers for supply chain mapping (RCS Global + battery suppliers or CMRT process, CDP and SGS)\n- Worldwide monitoring for Stellantis Tier 1, some sub-tier for specific topics\n- Supplier CSR assessments updated per specified frequency\n\n**Manage**\n- Audit activities to confirm compliance and discover areas for development and improved performance via an action plan\n\n**Additional Opportunities**\n- Auto industry knowledge/resources/tools development via associations (RMI, DS, AIAG, etc)\n- Supplier training events\n- Collaborative innovation to gain insight into potential risks within the extended supply chain e.g. the risk of forced labor in our supply chain beyond Tier 1 suppliers\n- Optimization; process, development, schedule, industrial capacity\n\nFor more information related to human rights in the supply chain refer to 7.2\nRISK #2 INEQUALITY OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN HOST TERRITORIES\n\nRisk Description\nInequality in economic development can cause problems with creating long term relationships within host territories with our stakeholders and specifically with suppliers. It is beneficial to boost local production in order to support our increasing internationalization plans. When our suppliers are located close to our operations it drives more efficient supply and helps to minimize environmental concerns, while providing improved economic opportunities for the entire community.\n\nPotential Impact\n- when suppliers are positioned close to our operations we may avoid additional costs related to; logistics, customs duties, carbon tax penalties, exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, while also benefiting from initiatives to drive local economy development;\n- failure to develop host territories could hinder Stellantis\u2019 efforts to reduce scope 3 CO\u2082 emissions from suppliers;\n- skeptical public opinion can occur regarding the redistribution of generated wealth if development of host territories is lacking.\n\nMitigation Strategy\nImplementing measures in two separate areas:\n- identification of local suppliers and assisting them to gain the needed skills and operational capacity\n- encourage our existing suppliers to relocate to clusters near to its facilities\nBy implementing these measures we are able to gain operational proximity which supports progress in technology, CSR and logistics. We also improve supply chain flexibility and reduce supply chain risk. By enhancing control of Tier N suppliers it is possible to take account of the supply risks inherent in the multi-layered subcontracting chain.\n\nAdditional Opportunities\n- reduce inbound logistics elements such as costs, CO\u2082 emissions and time to deliver products and services to our operations\n- better knowledge of local operating methods and in the local stakeholder expectations\n- focusing on local supplier development can support suppliers becoming more competitive and could drive the ability to access more international organizations in the future\n- strengthen brand recognition and potentially increase sales of our products\n\nFor more information refer to 2\nRISK #3\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS FROM OPERATIONS AND NATURAL DISASTERS WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nRisk Description\nIt is necessary to develop supply chains that are sustainable and can successfully manage multiple environmental impacts; such as those related to their own operations, physical damage from natural disasters or supply shortages. For activities related to supplier operations, starting from raw materials through to the production of goods and services, environmental impacts need to be appropriately addressed with robust standard operating procedures. The risk for supply disruption and reputational damage can occur if sufficient attention to an issue is lacking. Evaluating the impact of procuring and transporting the products, goods and materials through the supply chain (from the purchase of raw materials to network distribution) is essential to manage consumer expectations and the risks posed from the increasing number, scope and ambition of regulatory requirements.\n\nPotential Impact\n- Ecosystem degradation, i.e., deforestation and mining\n- Climate change\n- Exposure to eco-taxes levied on transport, as well as fossil energy price fluctuations\n- Localized pollution impacts such as water, air and sound e.g., bauxite mining for aluminum production\n\nMitigation Strategy\n- Optimize transport plans - development of alternate modes of transport\n- ISO 14001 certification of suppliers (via a Sustainability Assessment Questionnaire review)\n- Engage key suppliers with major Annual Purchased Value coverage (83% of direct suppliers by turnover) with corporate carbon accounting activities (via CDP in the short term)\n\nAdditional Opportunities\n- Reduce upstream and downstream delivery times\n- Best practice sharing\n- Improving transport costs upstream (parts)\n\nIMPACT MEASUREMENT OF THE ELECTRIFICATION STRATEGY\n\nElectrification relies on raw materials necessary to produce battery components. Stellantis\u2019 Responsible Purchasing Guideline integrate requirements regarding materials such as cobalt, where battery suppliers have obligations to disclose their raw material suppliers. Stellantis annually maps the sourcing of materials that are essential to electric vehicle battery manufacturing and is a member of the RMI to improve risk-identification in its supply chain. Due diligence is specifically conducted in the cobalt, lithium, nickel and graphite supply chains for all Stellantis battery suppliers in partnership with RCS Global, which conducted 30 external on-site audits (versus 40 in 2021) on critical suppliers in 2022.\n\nFurthermore, in order to secure the supply of critical materials needed to produce low-emission vehicles, Stellantis has reinforced its lithium supply with direct sourcing in Europe and North America. This local sourcing initiative will facilitate due diligence and supply chain mapping regarding lithium.\n\nFor more information refer to 6.1.3\nFor more information refer to 2.3.1.2\nFor more information refer to 2.7.3\nFor more information refer to 7.2.7\nFor more information refer to 2.7.3\n7.1.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nThe Global Purchasing and Supply Chain organization (GPSC) is the interface between Stellantis and its supplier. The GPSC is responsible for meeting all legal and regulatory requirements under its scope and to mitigate exposure risk from its supply base by driving its suppliers to be compliant with these requirements. This is a major duty of care toward supplier management across the globe. To support the direction of the GPSC, the Global Purchasing and Supply Chain EVP is a direct report to the CEO, and a member of the Top Executive Team, and as such, a member of the Company\u2019s strategy council.\n\nGlobal Purchasing and Supply Chain coordinates actions at different levels: centrally, in its international sites and within its various local offices spread globally. To fulfill its role, the GPSC organizes the following priorities by seeking to ensure:\n\n- the competitiveness and responsible procurement of products, equipment and services purchased for the manufacture of Stellantis vehicles and subassemblies by selecting accomplished responsible suppliers able to meet Stellantis\u2019 and stakeholder requirements\n- that suppliers provide the Company with innovative, sustainable solutions that can give it a competitive edge by liaising closely with the Automotive Research and Advanced Engineering departments\n- that the Company benefits from the expertise of its suppliers on the best economic terms by continually recommending improvements to quality and costs and seeing that they feed into all phases of the product life cycle\n- the quality and security of supplies by verifying that suppliers intrinsically meet the standards required by the Company in terms of social and environmental responsibility, quality and logistics\n- that a panel of responsible, viable and capable suppliers is established by taking all the necessary actions to support and secure the global supply chain in the best interests of Stellantis.\n\nGPSC is globally focused while taking local action, as appropriate. To support this it is necessary to work closely with other internal departments such as engineering, logistics, industrial and program teams and in general with all operating entities within Stellantis and its outside stakeholders.\n\nThe Stellantis sourcing process includes supplier CSR performance as a key evaluation factor for selected suppliers who are subjected to this review on risk-based approach. If the supplier performance is below the acceptable level a deviation with an action plan to correct issues is required. Governance is in place with monthly GPSC leadership team meetings, hosted by the Chief Global Purchasing and Supply Chain Officer to monitor supplier CSR performance during sourcing.\n\nGPSC also focuses on raw material management and applies appropriate due diligence using a risk matrix for specific materials. Approximately 25 materials are included in the evaluation, among them, tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold are designated as conflict minerals and of critical importance in this process. Our Conflict Minerals program is managed by regional and subsidiary conflict minerals team members. A global lead provides overall program management and consolidation direction to ensure that the corporate obligation is fulfilled.\n\nFor more information refer to 7.2.4\nThis Conflict Minerals program supports:\n\n- our annual report on our conflict minerals due diligence processes, filled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the purchasing commodity directors support escalation as needed to reinforce the importance of this legal requirement. The document was filed with SEC in May 2022.\n- our Vigilance plan, in accordance with the French Act No. 2017-399 of 27 March 2017 on the duty of vigilance.\n\nStellantis has a long history working with the sheltered sector, where most workers are persons with disabilities. Suppliers in the adapted and sheltered sector are meeting the same standards as the Company\u2019s other suppliers based on criteria such as quality, responsiveness and financial performance. Since developing this expertise, some sheltered suppliers have marketed their know-how to other customers and business sectors such as rail and aeronautical.\n\nTop supplier business review meetings are conducted annually with the objective to share and align strategies at the highest level of both companies while identifying value creation initiatives for mutual benefit. During the discussions emphasis is placed on social and environmental topics. These meetings can be regional or global depending on the classification and relationship with the supplier and are hosted by purchasing executives.\n\n### 7.1.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nThe Stellantis Code of Conduct has specific language pertaining to responsible purchasing and this message is reinforced in internal and external policies.\n\n**Customers, Suppliers and Business Partners**\n\nConducting our business with sustainable business practices is a core value at Stellantis. We encourage the adoption and sharing of sustainable practices among our business partners, suppliers and dealers through the Responsible Purchasing Guidelines. We strive to select all our suppliers based on the quality and competitiveness of their products and services and on their adherence to social, ethical and environmental principles while maintaining high standards of quality and taking care of the communities where we do business.\n\n**Whistleblowing**\n\nStellantis reinforces that employees, suppliers, dealers, consumers and other stakeholders can and should report any concerns of alleged situations, events or actions that may have been inconsistent with the Stellantis Code of Conduct and request advice about the application of the Code if needed.\n\nWe are firmly committed to act in a socially responsible manner and in line with sustainable practices within Stellantis and with our supply base seeking to protect the health and safety of its workforce, prohibiting child labor and forced labor, and complying with conflict minerals and environmental protection regulations.\nResponsible Purchasing and Support for the Respect of Human Rights in the Supply Chain\n\nStellantis\u2019 Code of Conduct and policies reflect our commitment to human rights and integrity, in general alignment with principles expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the United Nations Convention against Corruption to its suppliers.\n\nStellantis Responsible Purchasing Guidelines\n\nStellantis takes inspiration from the risk-based due diligence approach advocated by the OECD\u2019 Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. The Company is deploying its Responsible Purchasing Guidelines seeking to prevent child labor and forced labor in its supply chain, among other things, in line with the values expressed in International Labour Organization (\u201cILO\u201d) principles. In the Responsible Purchasing Guidelines, the Company encourages its suppliers to be vigilant for CSR risks within their supply chain. The Stellantis Responsible Purchasing Guidelines require new and renewing suppliers to sign the guidelines and grant awards based on innovation, efficiency, economic performance, and CSR performance. Stellantis has conducted evaluation activities to compare the benefits of the two leading Sustainability Assessment Questionnaires (SAQ) provided by EcoVadis and Drive Sustainability. The findings support choosing EcoVadis as the main data source for the Stellantis supply base.\n\nThrough these efforts, the Company seeks to secure its supply chains and also intends to boost supplier performance, who are called on to introduce CSR policies within their own organization and with their supply and subcontracting chains.\n\nSuppliers are required to agree and implement the Responsible Purchasing Guidelines that cover:\n\n- compliance with law\n- promotion of and compliance with internationally accepted human rights\n- freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining\n- elimination of any forms of forced or compulsory labor\n- effective fight against child labor and modern slavery\n- elimination of discrimination in terms of hiring and occupation\n- anti-corruption measures and the prevention of conflicts of interest\n- compliance with the legal minimum wage in national legislation or collective bargaining agreements\n- compliance with health and safety at work\n- implementation of an Environmental Management System such as ISO 14001 certification\n- banning the use of prohibited substances and materials\n- suppliers to obtain CSR commitment from their own suppliers consistent with those required by Stellantis\n- combating the use of minerals originating from areas of conflict\n\nThe Responsible Purchasing Guideline are available on the Stellantis website.\n\nhttps://www.stellantis.com/content/dam/stellantis-corporate/group/governance/corporate-regulations/global-responsible-purchasing-guidelines.pdf\n\nFor more information refer to 2.7.1\nstorage and use of personal data\n\n- implementation of an environmental policy for research on green or recycled materials, the reduction of CO\u2082 emissions and the protection of biodiversity\n- implementation of an anti-deforestation policy\n- protection of animal welfare.\n\nThe Stellantis Responsible Purchasing Guidelines require new and renewing suppliers to sign the guidelines and grant awards are based on:\n\n**Innovation**\n\nThe Company involves its core and strategic suppliers in a disruptive innovation process, which is essential in order to meet commitments on reducing CO\u2082 emissions, improving air quality and finding more sustainable materials e.g., increased recycled content for use in our products.\n\n**Efficiency**\n\nThe CSR commitments that the Company asks its suppliers to make, enables them to reduce their own operational risks. Suppliers are informed of best practices and regulatory changes and can benchmark themselves by comparing their CSR performance against the industry average. Being aware of opportunities to build on their strengths and implement action plans to work on weaknesses provides suppliers with a path to improvement. Stellantis monitors the progress of the action plans required from suppliers and helps them find solutions to improve their product quality or optimize their processes.\n\n**Economic Performance**\n\nIn view of the demanding supplier selection process, being a strategic or core supplier of Stellantis demonstrates a high-level of economic and CSR performance. Through innovation partnerships with Stellantis, suppliers are developing a competitive edge. This distinguishes them from their competitors when bidding for contracts in other markets. They can create commercial opportunities with customers who, like Stellantis, regard CSR criteria as a key aspect of the supplier selection and listing process. The Company\u2019s suppliers are expected to communicate their own CSR commitment and performance, EcoVadis score, to their customers, stakeholders and in all host regions. Similarly, being chosen to support Stellantis on international projects, companies are boosting their prospects by increasing their presence and competitiveness in new markets.\n\n**CSR Performance**\n\nThe Company\u2019s responsible purchasing approach drives attention to validated CSR performance from our suppliers. Our policy is to work with suppliers in a partnership to improve CSR performance overall. These expectations are an integral part of the supplier relationship and require a continuous focus to ensure we apply the needed resources to achieve top ranking status. This approach has created results that have Stellantis supplier CSR performance that is clearly above the EcoVadis benchmark.\n\n> For more information refer to 2.7.1\nSupplier Business Award and Third Party CSR Assessment\n\nStellantis\u2019 policy for all sourcing activity to award business to new and existing suppliers requires that CSR performance is systematically taken into consideration and globally reviewed. The goal is to ensure that responsible purchasing practices are in place with our selected suppliers and at an acceptable performance level. We seek to only award business to suppliers that share our values and can maintain required compliance and performance.\n\nIndustry Guidance\n\nSupporting the development of the automotive industry is important to help make progress on common topics. Stellantis contributed on the revision of the Automotive Guiding Principles with AIAG and Drive Sustainability. This document seeks to create alignment between automakers to address issues relevant to the industry, and to speak with a unified voice on the importance of a sustainable, ethical supply chain. These documents are updated on a regular basis and work to move the message forward and align with the evolving expectations for the entire supply chain. For example, the regulation in Germany and the upcoming regulation in EU are primary new additions to the content that already covers various existing requirements. The automotive industry needs to take on the challenges that are necessary to build the appropriate expectations for all levels of the complex and multi-tiered supply network. Stellantis is committed to being an engaged partner in the development and promotion of these needed guidance materials.\n\n7.1.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nResponsible Sourcing is primarily a function of the Global Purchasing and Supply Chain (GPSC) department. CSR activities are embedded into everyday life within the purchasing processes. Buyers are the primary point of contact for suppliers and required to work towards ensuring that all contractual obligations and expectations, such as the Responsible Purchasing Guideline, are upheld. They communicate with suppliers to raise awareness on requirements and strive to ensure that supplier CSR performance, assessed by EcoVadis, is at the necessary level for the supplier to be considered for sourcing opportunities. EcoVadis assessments are required to be renewed annually and suppliers are subject to onsite audits from recognized assessment bodies based on risk assessments.\n\nSupplier discussions are critical for alignment and driving results. Annual Supplier Business Review meetings are designed to address many factors that include CSR topics. A designated program lead manages the overall process and official documentation. The supplier discussion is supported by a member of top management, at a minimum the head of the division, and the buyer.\nExperts are designated at various levels within the Business Units, including:\n\n- **GPSC Champion** is a senior executive who is responsible for considering CSR issues / challenges in the decision-making process.\n- **CSR Correspondents** are responsible for the reliable disclosure of qualitative and quantitative data within their scope.\n- **Regional Contributors** are the local contacts that provide the specific regional elements as required.\n\nWe collaborate and participate with stakeholders to address common and specific issues. We focus on developing and implementing solutions that drive efficiencies and build common industry tools. Often the actions needed from suppliers are common within the automotive industry and can be leveraged. Some of the collaboration areas include:\n\n- internal departments such as engineering, logistics, industrial and program teams;\n- external stakeholders such as suppliers, OEMs and industry associations such as AIAG and VDA;\n- service providers such as CDP and EcoVadis.\n\n### Purchasing CSR Resources Matrix\n\n| RESOURCES & TOOLS                        | RESPONSIBLE SOURCING | HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN | CLIMATE CHANGE - CARBON ACCOUNTING |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Supplier Business Review meetings        | \u2713                    | \u2713                                | \u2713                                   |\n| Drive Sustainability                     | \u2713                    | \u2713                                | \u2713                                   |\n| NQC subgroup                             |                      | \u2713                                | \u2713                                   |\n| EcoVadis                                 |                      | \u2713                                |                                      |\n| RMI                                      | \u2713                    |                                  |                                      |\n| Automotive Industry Associations ACEA, AIAG, ANFIA, PFA, VDA | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 |\n| CDP                                      | \u2713                    |                                  |                                      |\n| SGS Social Audits                        | \u2713                    |                                  |                                      |\n| RCS Global, VINE application             |                      |                                  |                                      |\n| Conflict Minerals Program Assent, NQC    |                      |                                  |                                      |\n\nFor more information on the achievements refer to 7.1.7.\n7.1.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nStellantis has many initiatives that focus on responsible purchasing practices to support the Company\u2019s development in host territories. The activities are designed to support local sourcing development while providing measures that mitigate risks from suppliers and subcontractors.\n\nThe Responsible Purchasing Guidelines address topics focused on; compliance with laws, regulations, social and ethical principles, environmental protection and sustainable procurement including training and support for small and local suppliers. Stellantis requires suppliers to sign the Guidelines and ensure that they are aware of the expectations necessary to maintain the status of a Stellantis supplier. Suppliers are critical links in the chain of responsibility.\n\nIdentifying CSR risks in the supply chain\n\nStellantis uses risk analysis (mapping) to identify and prioritize actual or potential CSR incidents in the supply chain such as environmental, social and ethical topics. Due to the layers of the extended supply chain it can be difficult to gain visibility upstream. Stellantis defined and has begun to implement a global process to continuously identify and monitor risks from certain non-Tier 1 critical suppliers when relevant. Its findings are shared across all regions.\n\nWhere risk is identified, Stellantis has a prevention system to implement and monitor specific action plans with involved suppliers to prevent or mitigate any impact to the supply chain.\n\nTrend performance for suppliers is used to track improvement initiatives. When corrective action plans are launched the expectation is that CSR performance will improve for the targeted area. In 2022, 12% of suppliers have improved their CSR performance. The Company is transparent about the measures taken and the results obtained which are published annually in our CSR report.\n\nRisk mapping\n\nWe have opted to identify CSR risk by commodity for direct material purchases. The methodology used is built and incorporates third-party assessment ratings, such as EcoVadis Rating Framework:\n\n- CSR risk profiles on internal commodities were developed;\n- CSR risk profiles by country based on the EcoVadis list that includes 200 categories for 175 countries were developed;\n- supplier CSR performance assessments were entered in the EcoVadis database (currently more than 100,000 suppliers assessed, an increase of approximately 11,500 suppliers since last year);\n- collection of additional information from sources including unions, NGOs, media or data-collection specialists available for review.\nCritical suppliers: are a Tier 1/Tier N supplier who could cause production stoppages at Stellantis plants or delay the sales launch of new vehicles. There are five categories of high-risk suppliers:\n\n- suppliers who are the only source of a product\n- suppliers for whom Stellantis purchases represent over 30% of their annual revenue\n- suppliers who are financially stressed\n- suppliers whose failure to adhere to the Stellantis\u2019 CSR policy could damage the Company\u2019s reputation. These suppliers might cause a substantial negative impact on the environment, employment, human rights or society (particularly through unethical conduct)\n- suppliers who are located in high risk geographical areas.\n\nFor 2022, about 26% of the Tier 1 suppliers by number are considered as critical. Monitoring, mitigation and action plans are developed for these suppliers to implement a strategy customized for each case to protect Stellantis.\n\nSupporting company transformation through strategic partnerships with our suppliers\n\nAs announced in the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, Stellantis entered into strategic partnerships with leading companies intended to contribute to secure the supply of semiconductors, strategic raw materials and batteries for electric vehicles and support innovation, efficiency and shared know-how with Stellantis experts.\n\nAfter having signed the memorandum of understanding with Foxconn in 2021 with the intent to secure the supply of purpose-built semi conductors, further collaborations were started in 2022.\n\nStellantis and Controlled Thermal Resources Ltd. signed a binding offtake agreement with the objective to supply battery grade lithium hydroxide for use in Stellantis\u2019 North American electrified vehicle production.\n\nStellantis made an equity investment in Vulcan Energy Resources Ltd. worth \u20ac50 million, as extension of the original binding offtake agreement of 10 years. The equity investment will go towards Vulcan\u2019s planned production expansion drilling in its producing Upper Rhine Valley Brine Field (URVBF). Vulcan is already producing geothermal energy from its URVBF and plans to produce lithium hydroxide with zero fossil fuels and net zero carbon footprint as part of the Zero Carbon Lithium\u2122 Project.\n\nIn 2022, Stellantis finalized a joint venture with Samsung SDI for the production of battery cells and modules for North America, targeted to begin production in Kokomo, Indiana (U.S.) in 2025 with initial annual production capacity of 23 GWh. In 2022, Stellantis and LG Energy Solution also announced a plan to invest $5 billion CAD in a joint venture for Canada\u2019s first large scale lithium-ion battery production plant, which will be built in Windsor (Canada). The agreement between Stellantis and LG Energy Solution is subject to customary closing conditions.\nFocus on raw material risks: a material risk mapping is regularly reviewed and updated in terms of the criticality of materials with specific characteristics, importance for competitiveness, little or no current alternative, potential scarcity due to limited global production or fragile supply chains and questionable CSR conditions e.g., conflict minerals, lithium, cobalt and mica. This mapping is designed to enable us to manage and secure our supply over a long-term period and focus our research and development work on alternative materials. Our policy to seek out new, innovative materials combines with our quest to increase the proportion of renewable and environment-neutral materials in our vehicles. This analysis supports our ability to focus on critical suppliers, such as those included in our battery supply chain for development and management.\n\nFocus on conflict minerals: earnings from mining gold, tin, tantalum and tungsten might be used to finance armed conflict in the Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries. In accordance with required U.S. and EU regulations, Stellantis\u2019 policy requires transparency from its suppliers about the origin of any raw materials and minerals they use.\n\nEnvironmental damage: this is damage caused to water, air and soil either as a result of natural disasters or industrial accidents, or due to overexploitation of natural resources. The focus on industrial supplier risks uses a mechanism that enables the buyer to quickly identify the Company\u2019s exposure to the risks linked to each supplier production plant, using a matrix which takes into account criteria such as: geographical location (risk of natural disaster), the Company\u2019s share in the plant\u2019s production, how specific the technology used by the supplier is, how many of the Company\u2019s vehicles are affected by production at this plant, etc. This assessment method is used systematically to prepare technical and industrial procurement policies for each product group and each call for tenders. This result is systematically taken into consideration in the supplier selection process globally.\n\n7.1.7.1 Actions to mitigate risks from subcontractors or suppliers\n\nAssessments of the supply chain by recognized assessment bodies\n\nTo support the supplier assessment process on CSR criteria and make it more robust, Stellantis has embarked on an assessment of its Tier 1 supply base using criteria related to the environment, workforce, ethics and subcontracting chain. It has outsourced this assessment to an independent external company, EcoVadis. The first step was to identify supplier risks more precisely. Stellantis informed its suppliers that this evaluation was a prerequisite for the placement of future business, and to remain on the supplier panel. Stellantis requires its existing suppliers to be reassessed each year to continuously improve their CSR performance. A corrective action plan is automatically required for suppliers that do not receive a score that meets the standards set by Stellantis.\nAudits of suppliers at risk\n\nIn addition to the CSR assessment, on-site audits are performed. These audits are conducted for suppliers identified as risky according to three CSR criteria: countries (non-signatory country or country with questionable governance), products (inherently risky, such as promotional items) or processes (manufacturing processes involving hazardous substances). These social and environmental audits are also managed by an independent external service provider, SGS. An audit checklist is used covering the following topics:\n\n- CSR policy\n- human rights\n- working conditions\n- workplace health and safety\n- environment\n- supplier CSR management system.\n\nThese audits provide a snapshot of how the supplier is performing in terms of the Company\u2019s reference guide and the local statutes and regulations. The specifications stipulate that local auditors who speak the language of the audited site and who have a thorough knowledge of the applicable local laws, regulations and practices applicable to the site must carry out the audit. The external auditor creates an audit report for each audit. The report describes noncompliances and grades them according to four classifications; critical, core, minor and observations only, each requiring corrective action plans. If no satisfactory solution can be found to a critical or core noncompliance, a disengagement plan may be put in place after consultation with internal individuals affected by the decision. If necessary, an audit may be conducted to verify that action plans were implemented.\n\nSuppliers and their production plants are expected to be IATF 16949-certified. The IATF standard meets the growing expectations of markets and governments in relation to ethical business practices. It also incorporates changes and complexities specific to the automotive sector, such as requirements for onboard software, and strengthening product traceability in accordance with regulatory changes. Stellantis has added additional specific requirements for this certification. These additions include adherence to the Responsible Purchasing Guidelines and they contain specific CSR advice and actions required by suppliers. IATF conducts audits to ensure compliance with these specific requirements.\nSteps taken to prevent risks: governance of the supplier relationship\n\nSupplier briefings are held each month to provide suppliers with CSR updates, communicate the Company\u2019s CSR expectations and inform them of legal and regulatory developments in CSR matters. Risk prevention takes place in the day-to-day relationship between buyers and suppliers. Stellantis pays particular attention to supplier training and provides them with tools that enable them to rapidly identify and react to risk situations. Suppliers have access to e-learning on CSR principles to evaluate and improve their CSR performance and how to build robust internal processes supporting CSR.\n\nOn account of Stellantis\u2019 membership in the CCFA and PFA, the Automotive Sector Mediation Centre serves an independent entity to provide support to automotive companies for amicable dispute resolution (in disputes relating to the business relationship between customer and supplier). There were no mediated cases between Stellantis and a supplier in 2022.\n\nTraining for buyers and suppliers\n\nThe supplier training curriculum covers subjects related to purchasing, quality, supply chain management, manufacturing, finance and engineering. There are dedicated classes on sustainability-related topics such as responsible working conditions, environmental impacts, ethics and conflict minerals. The Company\u2019s ambition is to train 90% of the suppliers in CSR risks and the Stellantis requirements by 2025.\n\nBuyer training includes modules for CSR topics, Conflict Minerals and expectations during the sourcing process. Specific commodities may have additional requirements, such as EV batteries, where additional regulation and policies are in place. In 2022, 3 training events (versus 4 in 2021) with almost 700 purchasing professionals attending (versus 220 in 2021), where held.\n\n7.1.7.2 Monitoring signs of weakness to eliminate the causes of risk\n\nWhistleblowing channel\n\nStellantis reinforces that employees, suppliers, dealers, consumers and other stakeholders can and shall report any concerns of alleged situations, events, or actions that may have been inconsistent with the Stellantis Code of Conduct and request advice about the application of the Code.\n\nStakeholder feedback\n\nStellantis receives input from NGOs and actively collaborates with them on a partnership level. For example, we collaborate with selected NGOs on mica and leather programs. Additionally, a partnership with RCS Global, a responsible sourcing advisory and audit firm was established. In early 2020, former Groupe PSA formed a partnership with the RCS Global for a cobalt and lithium supply chain auditing program. Stellantis has expanded the scope to include additional suppliers and raw materials since 2021. The Company also reviews media and news reports on topics related to NGO findings on raw materials of all kind.\nMeasures taken if suppliers are found to be noncompliant with CSR requirements\n\nStellantis has introduced a comprehensive toolkit to measure the social and environmental performance of its suppliers and to identify any shortcomings or risks. The suppliers questioned or audited systematically receive an analysis of their performance. For suppliers who do not achieve the required standard, a corrective action plan is put in place. Suppliers that do not improve and collaborate to do so with Stellantis to resolve the issues identified might ultimately be excluded from Stellantis\u2019 supplier panel.\n\n7.1.7.3 Supplier Risk and Engagement Achievements\n\nAlready in its short history, Stellantis has had many positive results from the actions taken with our suppliers. Our list of achievements provides the details related to the performance of our efforts.\n\n- Stellantis has maintained high CSR compliance approval rates two years in a row (92% in 2022, 93% in 2021)\n- more than 2,973 supplier groups were assessed by EcoVadis, an increase of >400 compared to 2021. This accounts for more than 87% of the value of direct purchases, versus. 83% in the past year.\n  - 73% Overall Supplier Sustainability score which is classified as Good (ratings higher than 45 Points), up by 2% versus 2021\n  - 468 suppliers with corrective action plans in 2022 which is 16% of the total assessed suppliers (down from 18% in 2021)\n- 105 external social and environmental on-site audits were conducted, this marks an increase of 40% over 2021 with 75 conducted audits. Whenever a supplier is identified as noncompliant with the requirements of the Responsible Purchasing Guidelines, the Company requires the supplier to launch corrective action plans\n  - 30 (40 in 2021) audits were conducted by RCS Global for the battery supply chain from Tier 1 to mine sites, whereof 28 suppliers received their individual corrective action plan\n  - 75 (35 in 2021) SGS social and environmental audits for Tier 1 supplier were performed, whereof 71 suppliers are working on corrective action plans\n- with the major introduction of battery and hybrid electric vehicles the purchase contract has specific additional expectations that apply to battery suppliers in terms of due diligence and transparency to comply with the latest requirements regarding materials such as cobalt, lithium, graphite, and nickel\n- Stellantis supplier production plants are IATF 16949 and at a minimum ISO 9001 certified\n  - 83% of all suppliers are certified, of which:\n    - 90% in South/Latin America\n    - 86% in North America, up by 4% in 2022\n    - 79% in Europe, 5% more than 2021\n- more than 85% of suppliers trained on Stellantis CSR risks and requirements up by 5% versus 2021\n- 11 of our vehicle plants in Europe are working with the sheltered sector\n- almost 700 (versus 220 in 2021) employees were trained in three events (versus four in 2021) worldwide on the Stellantis CSR approach and ways to perform CSR actions.\n\nStellantis supplier performance shows that for the suppliers with a score >45, shown in green, are performing better than the EcoVadis benchmark. The benchmark is the average score of all suppliers aggregated in the EcoVadis tool.\n\nComparison between EcoVadis scores of Stellantis suppliers vs scores of all EcoVadis rated companies\nAdditional supplier engagement achievements\n\nStellantis provides World Class Management (WCM) methodology and tools to our suppliers, both new and existing ones. WCM support included plant shop floor assessments for new launch suppliers and focused improvement activities for those supporting current production, in both technical and operational assistance to its suppliers, like Monozukuri. To maximize the effectiveness of the program, suppliers and commodities are prioritized based on their impact on Stellantis plants, purchasing strategy and the supplier\u2019s current performance. Particular emphasis is placed on supplier plants involved in upcoming product launches. Dedicated WCM knowledge experts from Stellantis provide guidance and mentoring to improve supplier\u2019s key performance indicators and activities.\n\nSupplier programs that focus on fostering innovation to improve products, processes and content are essential for Stellantis. We may use different tools but it is the dedication of our employees that work with suppliers for value optimization and encourage a proactive approach to collaborate on cost saving ideas and technical solutions. For 2023 we plan to strengthen the Monozukuri process by a stronger involvement of our specialists to support our suppliers on their efficiency.\n\nOur suppliers participated in more than 10 Technology Day events, seven of which were at Stellantis facilities in Europe and North America and more online or at supplier facilities. These events encourage collaboration with Stellantis personnel and suppliers on innovative solutions for features, efficiencies and quality, and allow suppliers to share their latest technological developments and concepts for the future.\n\nA partnership that promotes sustainable performance: Supplier Awards\n\nThe Supplier Awards are an opportunity to reaffirm the strategic importance of the supplier relationship as a fundamental driver in achieving the Company\u2019s strategic plan for profitable growth and developing differentiating technological innovations in response to the challenges of global competitiveness. The Global Purchasing and Supply Chain Department rewarded the best suppliers in several categories. One of the categories is CSR Performance. The list of award-winning suppliers is validated by a committee to ensure that the suppliers are compliant with the assessment criteria in other categories. For example, a supplier cannot be given an award in the value-creation category unless it has reached the required CSR level. In 2022, 12 suppliers received awards for their commitment and quality of their response to the Company\u2019s expectations.\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\nStellantis Recognizes 12 Suppliers for Quality,

AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\nCSR issue/challenge #21: Human rights in the supply chain\n\nExpectations from stakeholders are growing in terms of their interest to be informed about the origin of products and related production conditions for what they buy. It is crucial that we work to provide transparency throughout the supply chain, regardless of the difficulty to implement.\n\nManaging social, societal and ethical impacts in the supply chain is a core priority for Stellantis, given the extensive international expansion in emerging countries of our supply base. We intend to align with common, globally embraced environmental and social principles by working together to improve our supply base sustainability development. Enhancing transparency regarding raw material origin and human rights within our complex global supplier network is a high priority. We respect the responsibility we have for due diligence and the opportunity to be socially respectful within the extended enterprise. Stellantis focuses on improving supplier social performance and complying with social, societal and ethical standards in our supply chain.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nIn its Code of Conduct, its Human Rights Policy, in the Responsible Purchasing Guidelines, and as a signatory to the United Nation\u2019s Global Compact, the Company expresses its commitment on human rights, and principles as expressed in various recognized foundational documents, such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the United Nation\u2019s Declaration of Human Rights, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, the United Nations Convention against Corruption, and other documents.\n\nIn this spirit, we strive to implement preventive measures to uphold human rights and ethical principles, meet social and ethical standards inspired by the International Labour Organization\u2019s (ILO) rules for human rights such for the abolition of child and forced labor, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and customer expectations considering the risks specific for the automotive supply chain. We also endeavor to adhere to the standards, norms and regulations defined by supranational bodies such as, ISO 26000, ISO 20400, ISO 14021, UK REACH. Our processes and controls intend to meet the legislative requirements of France\u2019s Duty of Vigilance, EU Conflict Minerals regulation, the U.S. Dodd Frank Act and the Modern Slavery Act and to extend these principles to the extended supply network including the sub-tier suppliers.\n\nStellantis opposes forced and child labor throughout the entire supply chain, including raw materials suppliers. We require that our direct suppliers to apply these standards and cascade them throughout their supply chain.\n7.2.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\nCommitment scoreboard\n\n| CSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE | VISION/AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | RESULTS |\n|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|---------|\n| Human rights in the supply chain | Require, monitor and control the total respect for human rights along the entire global supply chain process, involving all actors to ensure transparency and full alignment with Human Rights principles | Average human rights scores of Stellantis Tier 1 suppliers assessed by independent third party | Short-term: 2025: Increase of +2.5% vs score as of 01/01/21 | 2022: 4.4% Increase in Performance since 01/01/21 |\n| | | | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan): 2030: Increase of +5% vs score as of 01/01/21 | 2021: 2.7% increase in performance during 2021 |\n| | | | Long-term: 2050: in top level performance category | |\n\n7.2.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nHuman Rights and Forced Labor commitments\n\nStellantis is focused on human rights and the encouragement of appropriate attention from our supply network. An important aspect we address is the prohibition of child or forced labor within the extended supply chain. This is a difficult task beyond our Tier 1 suppliers. We are creating partnerships with providers that will support actions to monitor the many layers within the complex extended supply network.\n\nParticipation on automotive industry work groups is part of our process to address the concerns of forced labor by bringing together expertise from cross functional teams. Customs and Sustainability teams from OEMs and suppliers are working together to help develop ideas and strategies.\n\nStellantis pays specific attention to the Human Rights section of the overall Responsible Sourcing topic.\n\nFor more information refer to 7.1.6\n### RISK #1\n\n**HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN THE EXTENDED SUPPLY NETWORK**\n\n| Risk Description | Potential Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Additional Opportunities |\n|------------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|\n| Due to the extended supply chain structure it can be complex to work towards ensuring the avoidance of human rights violations. Supply chain management based on continuous risk assessment with the objective of reducing exposure to risk and improving performance is a critical element for Stellantis\u2019 supply chain management programs. It is of high importance to work with suppliers that share the same objectives to support the elimination of human rights violations. We expect our suppliers to share the principles we live by and to cascade these principles throughout the extended supply network. | \u25aa Violation of legislation in case of an incident (e.g. Duty of Vigilance Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act) in the global supply chain  \n\u25aa Supply disruption due to strikes/social conflicts  \n\u25aa Remediation costs to resolve issues found at any level of the extended supply chain;  \n\u25aa Compensation to victims in the event of incidents  \n\u25aa Loss of productivity and quality  \n\u25aa Ethical breaches on supplier quality risks  \n\u25aa Reputation risk - crisis of confidence in the event of a proven supplier failure  \n\u25aa Declining Brand reputation that might impact sales  \n\u25aa Additional measures may be required to secure supply (security stock/dual sourcing)  \n\u25aa Supplier removal from panel or bid | \u25aa Identify risk by commodity, country and industry for direct and develop plans for indirect material purchases  \n\u25aa Based on EcoVadis Rating Framework and/or other risk intelligence sources  \n\u25aa Commitment to the Global Compact and building on its Great Place to Work Framework Agreement, which extends to suppliers and partners  \n\u25aa Engagement with several multi-stakeholder organizations, both within and outside the automotive industry  \n\u25aa Onsite audit activities  \n\u25aa RCS Global - Battery suppliers  \n\u25aa SGS - Social audits  \n\u25aa Corrective action plans | \u25aa Anticipating future regulations and the opportunity to improve the industry and our suppliers.

Funding armed conflict is a concern that requires due diligence to provide transparency regarding the origin of specific minerals, such as tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold. Through supplier assurance measures we seek to help put an end to the exploitation and abuse of local communities, including mine workers, while supporting local development.\n\nPotential Impact\n- Finance of armed conflict\n- Incidents of child, forced or compulsory labor in the sub-tier supply chain\n- Difficulty to secure supply of critical minerals\n- Reputation concerns\n  - Negative publicity\n  - Loss of investor confidence\n  - Negative brand association for future customers\n\nMitigation Strategy\n- Ethical and conscientious procurement practices during the mineral extraction, trade and processing stages\n- Conduct due diligence activities to provide supply chain transparency and smelter validation\n- Training to provide suppliers with Stellantis\u2019 expectations and tools and resources to supplier development\n- Supplier Business Review meetings to reinforce the alignment of objectives and legal obligations to continue the ongoing relationship with Stellantis\n- Membership with recognized partners such as RMI which serves as the voice of industry to support responsible mineral sourcing and convenes stakeholders to continually shape dialogue and practices.\n\nAdditional Opportunities\n- Use of 3TGs from verified \u2018conflict free\u2019 sources to support green and local sourcing initiatives\n- Redesign goods and services to eliminate the used of 3TGs\n- Vertical integration for secured mineral supply\n- Access to regulated markets on human rights aspects\n- Automate the process\n- Enhance corporate image among civil society\n### RISK #3\n\n**NON-REGULATED MATERIALS IN THE EXTENDED SUPPLY CHAIN - COBALT, MICA, BAUXITE/ALUMINUM, NICKEL, LITHIUM, ETC**\n\n| Risk Description | Mitigation Strategy | Additional Opportunities |\n|------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|\n| There are many materials that can become a focus item based on potential human rights violations. These types of raw materials used in the manufacturing of goods and services for the automotive industry may lead to detrimental behaviors in the extended supply chain. Often there are preliminary stages prior to official legislative measures that should alert users to concerning activity. It is essential to stay aware and engaged with multiple stakeholders to learn and to build resources.

The Stellantis Responsible Purchasing Guideline requires battery suppliers to disclose their raw material suppliers. These materials can pose human rights risks in the supply chain particularly cobalt in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nMore than 2,974 supplier groups are covered by a CSR assessment performed by an external third-party including human rights criteria. Part of the expectation is that the management of the extended supply chain has appropriate measures to identify, mitigate and monitor potential human rights issues. Stellantis conducts an annual mapping for the source of essential materials for electric vehicle battery manufacturing. In 2021, we partnered with RCS Global to apply due diligence with our critical suppliers regarding cobalt and lithium supply chains by conducting 78 external on-site audits since then.\n\nNGOs identified that another material that the energy transition relies on, i.e., aluminum, also poses human rights issues. Drive Sustainability, a Stellantis partner, launched a project to identify human rights risks in the supply chains of 10 raw materials, including aluminum. In July 2021, Human Rights Watch issued a report on human rights violations risks in the aluminum supply chain, naming aluminum the \u201cblind spot\u201d of car companies due diligence policies. Therefore, the description of the impact of electrification on human rights in the supply chain should not only refer to materials such as cobalt and lithium, but also to aluminum.\n\nThese activities improve our ability to address human rights risks in its supply chain where they may exist.\n\n7.2.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nStellantis uses governance mechanisms to manage and monitor human rights in supply chain at various levels, in addition to those already described in the section Responsible Purchasing Practices.\n\nOur Conflict Minerals program is managed by regional and subsidiary conflict minerals team members. A global lead provides overall program management and consolidation direction to ensure that corporate obligations are fulfilled. The Stellantis conflict mineral supplier submission status is tracked and communicated by the purchasing organization to ensure that any needed escalation efforts are deployed quickly. The purchasing commodity directors are involved in escalation activities with the supply base, as needed, to reinforce the importance of providing due diligence evidence to support Stellantis\u2019 legal requirements. A report must be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) annually to show the efforts taken to determine the mine or location of origin. Suppliers who are required to submit the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template must provide it within the appropriate time period or be considered as non-compliant. If a supplier is found to be non-compliant they may be recommended for removal from the sourcing panel.\nSupplier on-site audit program\n\nThere are protocols in place to manage audit activities. We hold meetings with the service providers to ensure the programs are progressing and any issues or concerns are addressed. If a critical non-compliance is found the supplier is flagged for additional escalation activities and appropriate purchasing management members are notified. At the close of the audit a formal debrief is conducted to share the findings with the supplier. Depending on the findings, after the debrief individual follow up is made to ensure that corrective action plans are implemented, if required a follow-up audit is performed to have the necessary evidences of implementation. Internally we review the audit activities and results with top purchasing management and when appropriate suppliers with exemplary results are recognized by the purchasing team.\n\nDiversity and Inclusion focus programs\n\nWe work to include diversity and inclusion considerations as an everyday practice in our dealings with employees, dealers, suppliers and customers. Training, mentoring, scholarship support, sponsorship and membership with Board and committee participation are some of the ways we support various diversity organizations. Diversity spend targets are created for suppliers based on diversity categories. Performance is captured as a strategic indicator on the Global External Balanced Scorecard, which can be used in sourcing decisions.\n\nTo receive credit towards their diversity goals, a supplier is required to work with certified diversity Tier 2 suppliers. The diversity spend status of each supplier is monitored and reviewed with them. The High Focus program works with the suppliers that have a greater potential for diverse spending and equips them with tools and support to achieve their diversity targets.\n\nSheltered and adapted sector\n\nCommitment for the social and occupational inclusion of people with disabilities is an important segment to Stellantis. We have dedicated resources that support the national organizations, with a focus in France and Spain. Specific budgets and processes are set and managed to ensure attention on this segment.\n7.2.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nStellantis combined its Conflict Minerals policy and the Responsible Purchasing Charter into the Responsible Purchasing Guideline.\n\nSTELLANTIS\u2019 FOCUS AREAS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE EXTENDED SUPPLY CHAIN\n\n- Implement due diligence measures with the subcontracting chain\n- Support and respect the protection of internationally-proclaimed human rights\n- Uphold freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining\n- Eliminate all forms of forced labor and child labor\n- Eliminate discrimination in respect to employment and occupation\n- Favorable working conditions in relation to remuneration, working hours and respect for health and safety at work\n- Prohibited substances & materials\n- Fair trade practices\n- Animal Welfare\n- Export controls, sanction laws and regulation\n- Training & Support of small and local suppliers\n- Sustainable Procurement deployment of all RPG elements through all supply tiers\n- Small/local supplier support via facilitation of technological upgrades and acquisition of long-term assets\n- Development of skills\n- Retention & use of personal data\n- Capacity building\n- Responsible Purchasing Guidelines (RPG) - Human Rights Focus\n- Social Principles\n- Ethical Principles\n- Laws\n- Compliance\n- Focus\n- Raise sub-tier supplier CSR awareness\n\nFor more information refer to 7.1.5\nIATF Certification\n\nStellantis suppliers are required to complete our customer specific requirements which includes adherence to our Responsible Purchasing Guidelines, Corporate Social Responsibility recommendations and required actions. The certifying bodies for IATF conduct audits regarding these specific requirements. The IATF 16949 certification is granted for three years with an annual monitoring audit. Certification is suspended and additional audits are conducted if there are core compliance failures so that corrective actions can be implemented.\n\nOnsite Auditing\n\nOnsite audit activities are performed by certified auditors from distinguished external assessment bodies. Currently we have partnered with SGS for these audit activities. Guidance is provided via program documentation that includes the supplier kick-off notification, audit checklist and closure debrief. Any non-compliance requires an improvement plan. During the closing meeting the supplier receives the auditor findings and is required to sign-off on any improvement plans. These plans are monitored to ensure that the identified concerns are resolved. Additional follow-up visits may be required to confirm evidence onsite.\n\nWhistleblowing\n\nStellantis reinforces that employees, suppliers, dealers, consumers and other stakeholders can and should report any concerns of alleged situations, events or actions that may be inconsistent with the Stellantis Code of Conduct. They can also request advice about the application of the Code of Conduct.\n\nWe are committed to act in a socially responsible manner that is in line with sustainable practices within Stellantis and at each level of the supply base including ensuring the health and safety of the workforce, prohibiting child and forced labor, complying with conflict minerals and adhering to environmental protection regulations.\n\n7.2.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nFor detailed information on which resources are available in Stellantis to ensure Responsible Purchasing.\n\nMonitoring potential human rights violations within the Stellantis supply chain requires internal and external resources. The most prominent areas of concern regarding human rights can be many layers deep within the complex automotive supply network. Even though Stellantis may not have a direct contractual relationship with these entities, we recognize our responsibility to provide appropriate due diligence for materials that are critical and may be provided from conflict affected and high risk areas. There are designated individuals that perform multiple internal activities such as extracting critical data from internal systems, developing and managing the needed campaigns, reporting the status to top management and providing program management oversight for our service providers.\nConflict Minerals Program Management\n\nThe conflict minerals program management team is responsible for generating the annual in-scope supplier list that identifies which suppliers are required to provide the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT). The list of parts for products containing tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold is provided from regional technical contacts upon request. The International Material Data System (IMDS) is a global data repository that contains information on materials used by the automotive industry and this, or an equivalent system, is used to provide the part content information.\n\nOnce the Conflict Minerals data collection process begins, the designated members are required to track supplier submissions and provide updates so that progress reports can be presented to the purchasing management team. If a supplier is unresponsive they will be placed into the escalation process which includes notifying the buyer and their management as appropriate.\n\nResponsible sourcing service Providers\n\nMany of the service providers that support our Responsible Purchasing activities have focused elements that are specific to identifying and addressing human rights violations. We have partnered with RCS Global and are an active member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). Both of these organizations are recognized providers that conduct onsite audits throughout the supply chain including Tier 1 suppliers as well as mine sites. This is another way that we fulfill our duty to adhere to the high expectation of vigilance.\n\nRCS Global\n\n- mapping battery supply chain to gain greater transparency\n- on-site audits in the sub-tier supply chain levels\n- expanded materials of focus\n- utilization of tools such as the Vine data base\n- increase in scope for materials of focus to address materials used in EV batteries\n- sending corrective actions for suppliers post audit\n\nResponsible Minerals Initiative (RMI)\n\n- engagement with multiple work groups\n- use of the Smelter database to support our Conflict Minerals filing\n- Risk Readiness Assessment (RRA) promotes common understanding of good practices and a means to consistently assess risks in mineral supply chains\nResponsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP) is an assessment that employs a risk-based approach to validate smelters\u2019 company-level management processes for responsible mineral procurement.\n\nConflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT) is an essential tool to gather information about the source of materials in our products, and the smelters and refiners that process the materials.\n\nCobalt Reporting Template (CRT) is a standardized reporting template developed to identify choke points and collect due diligence information in the cobalt supply chain.\n\nMaterial Insights interactive module to update the prior Material Insights report.\n\nWe are members of several automotive industry associations.\n\n7.2.7 MAIN INITIATIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS\n\nInitiatives to support the respect of human rights in the supply chain\n\nStellantis incorporates workforce-related and social criteria into the purchasing process to ensure our focus on human rights is upheld within the extended global supply chain. Our suppliers are expected to sign and apply the requirements from our Responsible Purchasing Guidelines which has specific attention on compliance with social and ethical principles.\n\nThe Stellantis Responsible Purchasing Guidelines are inspired by the recommendations of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and envision:\n\n- a public commitment to human rights\n- risk mapping for human rights infringements\n- preventive measures to address identified risks\n- corrective action must be taken for suppliers potentially or currently involved in a human rights infringement\n- action plan monitoring\n- communication of measures put in place.\n\nStellantis identifies the regions and areas that have the largest risk of human rights violations and modern slavery. The regions and areas at risk are identified based on two criteria:\n\n- country (countries that have not signed up to global agreements, countries ill-equipped to enforce international laws)\n- manufacturing process (whether it requires a significant amount of low-skilled labor and additionally is dangerous).\n\nBased on this, the Company applies a graduated reasonable efforts approach. This might result in removing a supplier from the panel or bid if it should become evident that it was directly or indirectly involved in this type of practice. It is the Company\u2019s policy to assist and guide suppliers so that they can improve. However, if they are clearly unwilling to make changes, Stellantis reserves the right to cease all contact and to remove them from its supplier database.\nPracticing due diligence\n\nStellantis works to apply due diligence to ensure that its social demands are met by its suppliers. We apply risk-based due diligence measures that seek to identify risks and prevent serious infringements of human rights and fundamental freedoms in our supply chain of subcontractors or suppliers with whom there is an established business relationship. We seek to incorporate our expectations into our relationship with our suppliers, deriving inspiration from OECD Due Diligence Guidance. The measures put in place by the GPSC aim to ensure that suppliers fulfill social and environmental commitments.\n\nStakeholder engagement\n\nThrough engagement with several multi-stakeholder organizations, both within and outside the automotive industry, Stellantis seeks to address not only the needs, but the opportunities that exist through ethical and conscientious procurement practices during the mineral extraction, trade and processing stages. Stellantis collaborates with automotive and cross-industry associations to develop the global extended supply chain and build resources that support due diligence activities.\n\nStellantis has specific legal obligations, section 1502 of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act and the new EU regulation, that must be met regarding the country of origin for conflict minerals. We are required to conduct due diligence to determine whether tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold in the supply chain originated from the covered countries, and whether the procurement of those minerals supported armed conflict in the region. This issue is not unique for Stellantis and working to build industry resources is beneficial for us and our suppliers that are often common among automotive manufacturers.\n\nStellantis is a member of Drive Sustainability. This association provides greater engagement with other OEMs, as well as access to additional tools and resources. In 2022, newly revised Guiding Principles which outline expectations for suppliers on key responsibility issues including human rights, environment, working conditions and business ethics were published by the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG) and the Drive Sustainability group.\n\nIn the AIAG Corporate Responsibility Steering Committee, Stellantis was elected co-chair of the Responsible Minerals workgroup which leads auto industry engagement in cobalt, mica and conflict minerals activities and relationships. Stellantis employees are engaged in a number of other AIAG teams that partner automakers with suppliers. New groups are launched to address industry issues such as the Forced Labor and Human Rights team that brings together volunteers from diverse departments with specific backgrounds such as Customs and CSR experts.\n\nStellantis is co-chair of the Responsible Minerals workgroup which leads auto industry engagement in cobalt, mica and conflict minerals activities and relationships in the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG) Corporate Responsibility Steering Committee.\n\nAIAG Guidelines\n\nhttps://www.drivesustainability.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Automotive-Sustainability-Guiding-Principles-4.0v2-Final.pdf\nOur membership with the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), which was founded by members of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative, supports cross-industry discussion and development of common tools. Participation on RMI sub-teams facilitates development of best practices for supply chain assurance mechanisms. We work closely with RMI and its Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP). The RMAP uses an independent third-party assessment of smelters and refiners\u2019 management systems and sourcing practices to validate conformance with RMAP standards. The assessment employs a risk-based approach to validate smelters and refiners\u2019 company-level management processes for responsible mineral procurement.\n\nThrough our work with diverse stakeholder organizations we are helping to build fair supply chains of minerals in the covered countries.\n\n**Focus on conflict minerals**\n\nEarnings from mining gold, tin, tantalum and tungsten might be used to finance armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries. In accordance with required U.S. and EU regulations, Stellantis\u2019 policy requires the utmost transparency from its suppliers about the origin of any raw materials and minerals they use. A specific clause is inserted in the purchase contract for battery suppliers (article 16.2.3), stating that the supplier must disclose the detailed composition of the materials used to manufacture the parts supplied, as well as any changes in that composition. This requirement complies with the French Law of Duty of Vigilance. The supplier must also provide the written information necessary to comply with the legislation in force, particularly on consumer protection and conflict minerals. The Purchasing Department identifies the in-scope suppliers to include in the annual Conflict Minerals reporting campaign.\n\nStellantis is engaged to reduce the use of raw materials that carry environmental and social risks.\n\nStellantis has access to a wide range of information and data from RMI that supports our efforts to ensure that sustainability standards are implemented by smelters and the mining industry. The Company has access to the RMI smelter database, assurance process and all the latest information and training materials available to support appropriate due diligence to promote responsible raw material supply chains. The Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT) that is provided by the RMI is requested from the in-scope suppliers using the 3TG metals (tungsten, tantalum, tin and gold). If there are concerns regarding the sourcing of raw materials, the suppliers have to address the concerns and potentially set up alternative sources. The Company thus seeks to exercise its duty of care and foster sustainable procurement.\n\nThe Conflict Minerals reporting process begins by determining the in-scope suppliers that have parts that contain tantalum, tin, tungsten or gold, based on part data from the International Material Data Sheets (IMDS). A response to the CMRT is then required from more than 2,000 in-scope direct and after-market suppliers in order to obtain smelter information.\nFurther, we:\n\n- expect our suppliers to source materials from suppliers who also source responsibly, including from legitimate, conflict-free mines in the covered countries\n- require relevant suppliers make reasonable efforts to conduct the necessary due diligence and provide us with proper verification of the country of origin and source of the materials used in the products they supply to Stellantis\n- support initiatives to verify smelters and refiners that are conflict-free and expect our suppliers to utilize any such conflict-free smelter/refiner programs that are available\n- review all incoming CMRT submissions from our suppliers\n- provide detailed smelter analysis to suppliers reporting non-conformant smelters in their supply chain.\n\nTo prepare suppliers for submitting information Stellantis provided training for the targeted suppliers regarding the completion and submission of the CMRT.\n\nWe strive to ensure companies or individuals in legal business activities are not harmed by our efforts to avoid using minerals that are illegally obtained. To this end, we work to promote sourcing from responsible sources in the region. Stellantis also engages with industry and cross-sector groups to promote and develop our raw material supply chain focusing on, but not limiting our efforts to, commodities such as cobalt and mica.\n\n**Cobalt and others**\n\nCobalt is of growing interest for the auto industry due to its use in electric vehicle batteries. Stellantis has taken action to engage suppliers regarding cobalt in their products given the ongoing concerns around the use of child/forced labor, and other unsafe or non-compliant practices in the mining of cobalt. Expanding into new materials relies on the lessons learned from our Conflict Minerals process in addition to applying industry tools and resources.\n\nUtilizing and teaching our suppliers the OECD 5-Step Framework for Upstream and Downstream Supply Chains provides a common foundational tool that helps solidify responsible sourcing practices and decisions made throughout our supply chain. In addition, cross-sector engagement brings together experts from numerous industries to use their global presence and leverage to drive ground-level improvements in the mining of metals and minerals through process, tool and infrastructure improvements.\n\nTo help companies address these challenges, the RMI has developed the Risk Readiness Assessment, which addresses environmental, social and governance risks present in the global supply chain. This tool can help improve supply chain transparency and mapping to mitigate undesirable practices as they relate to Conflict Minerals, cobalt and other raw materials. RMI has also collaborated with the Responsible Cobalt Initiative on a joint cobalt refiner audit program, aligned with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance and the Chinese Due Diligence Guidelines for Mineral Supply Chains.\nIn 2022 Stellantis further extended its partnership with the responsible sourcing advisory, traceability technology and audit firm RCS Global, for a multi-material supply chain program covering battery materials including cobalt, lithium, graphite, and nickel.\n\nThe program continues the groundbreaking work started in 2020 which identified the origin of raw materials, human rights risks, and due diligence conformance of the Stellantis supply chain.\n\nSince 2021 the Purchasing Department utilizes Vine \u2013 RCS Global\u2019s online due diligence management platform for supply chain traceability and supply chain visualization. Stellantis is an early supporter of Vine, which allows the Company to identify, review and analyze sustainability risks and respond rapidly to critical risks where they are identified.\n\nMica represents another area of concern for child labor. It is used predominantly in surface coatings and contained in other vehicle materials, such as in polymers for exterior mirror housing and covers. Stellantis has been a supporter of the 2021 release of the Global Workplace Standard for Mica Processors which addressed social obligations covering a range of labor practices such as; age of employment, fair working hours, minimum wages and overtime, grievance mechanisms, freedom of association and diversity provisions, including women\u2019s rights and under-represented communities.\n\nHuman rights impacts are a concern due to the mining practices deployed to harvest the mineral Bauxite, which is used in aluminum production. In an effort to raise awareness and reinforce the automotive industries focus on human rights in the supply chain, the members of Drive Sustainability collaborated in 2021 to send a letter to the European Aluminum Association and to The Aluminum Association in the U.S. regarding Bauxite mining in Guinea. The message expressed our commitment to protect human rights in the aluminum automotive supply chain.\n\nAchievements\n\nAlmost 700 Purchasing employees trained on Human Rights policies or procedures, a strong increase compared to 220 employees trained in 2021.\n\nCSR Assessment\n\nEcoVadis supplier assessments include corrective action plans to drive overall score improvements. Corrective action plans are a key factor to account for gap closure and sustainable long-term impact.\n\n- With an average overall Human Rights section score of 54.1 (up by 0.9 versus 2021), suppliers working with Stellantis outperformed all suppliers assessed by EcoVadis, who have an average score of 47.6 (up by 1.0 versus 2021)\n\n- During 2022, 359 assessed or audited suppliers received a corrective action plan specifically on human rights issues, which is 12 percent of the total assessed or audited suppliers versus 333 in 2021 which accounted for 13 percent of the total assessed or audited suppliers.\nOn-site Audits are used as a means to address activities that are deemed higher risk. This is the next phase of our due diligence process, to increase the focus on topics that are critical for Stellantis regarding CSR. Each audit finding requires a corrective action plan that is tracked through implementation. In 2022, 71 corrective action plans have been launched, each containing multiple elements. Some examples of improvements that were realized in 2022 together with our suppliers are:\n\n**Human rights**\n- grievance committees and works committees that workers can raise issues or concerns to were introduced\n- suppliers updated their Code of Conduct and Standards of Conduct with the statement to be not engaged in forced labor, child labor, or any other similar activities.\n\n**Health & Safety at work**\n- emergency first aid equipment was installed and closer maintained\n- workers were trained as qualified first aiders\n\n**Environment**\n- boundary noise level testings were conducted to ensure that the noise nuisance will be improved for workers\n\n**Management System**\n- suppliers have started to conduct supplier visits to confirm their activities to their own suppliers\n\n**Conflict Minerals reporting**\n- 90% of the in-scope suppliers for parts containing tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold have submitted the required CMRT.\n- 71.5% of smelters reported have been validated as conformant according to the RMAP standard\n- 14.3% of smelters are listed and being active according to the RMAP or cross-sector recognized standards\n\nThe percentage of turnover slightly decreased in 2022 due to the late answer of some suppliers and the increase of suppliers involved.\n\n**Final status of 2022 supplier assessment on conflict minerals**\n\n| Status by turnover | 2022 | 2021 |\n|--------------------|------|------|\n| COMPLETED          | 89.6%| 92.1%|\n| IN PROCESS         | 2.3% | 5.8% |\n| NO RESPONSE        | 8.1% | 2.1% |\n\n90% of targeted suppliers have submitted the CMRT.\nRCS Global audits\n\nProgram extended successfully in 2022\n\n- Completed audits: 30 total audits, 21 initial audits and 9 re-audits of companies at every Tier of Stellantis\u2019 cobalt and lithium supply chains (battery manufacturer, cathode manufacturer, refiner, treatment unit, and mine site). Audit scope: cobalt, lithium, nickel and graphite\n- Accepted Corrective Action Plans: 15\n- Identified suppliers: >680\n- Number of Country of Origin (for mine site): 15\n  - Australia, Madagascar, Brazil, DRC, China, Turkey, Ivory Coast, Canada, New Caledonia, Russian Federation, U.S., Papa New Guinea, Indonesia, Chile, Finland.\n\nThe results put Stellantis in a good position to significantly address human rights risks in its supply chain where they exist.\n\nBusiness with the sheltered sector\n\nStellantis is committed to helping our suppliers maintain their policy of inclusion of handicapped workers. Promoting equal opportunity in the workplace is vital to Stellantis\u2019 human resources management and the Company\u2019s long-term success. A wider, more diverse pool of talent improves the Company\u2019s understanding of our workforce and our customers. Stellantis works with six major French associations: Fondation Pluriel (former Adapei du Doubs), Adapei de Haute Sa\u00f4ne, Talendi (former Bretagne Ateliers), Adapei Papillons Blancs in Alsace, Les Ateliers de l\u2019Ostrevent, the AMIPI/SLAMI Foundation together with Spanish association ILUNION.\n\nThe services bought from the adapted and sheltered sector added up to \u20ac50 million.\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\n- Stellantis is focused on empowering equal employment opportunities based on merit without regard to race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, age, protected veteran status, marital status, religion, national origin, disability status, genetic information or other basis protected by law. We work to include diversity and inclusion considerations as an everyday practice in our dealings with our employees, our dealers, our suppliers and our customers. Stellantis believes the diversity of our suppliers should reflect the diversity of our workforce and the communities in which we do business. Stellantis provided support to organizations that included DisabilityIN where the focus is on empowering business to achieve disability inclusion and equality.\nStellantis spent more than $7.9 billion with Tier 1 and Tier 2 diverse suppliers in 2022. The External Balanced Scorecard of U.S.-based suppliers to Stellantis includes a metric for diversity sourcing at the Tier 2 level. The diversity spend status of each supplier is monitored monthly and reviewed with them quarterly.\n\nRecognition of the diversity efforts the Company has made are presented throughout the year. These awards honor corporations for diversity programs that reduce barriers and drive growth for suppliers that are appropriately certified with approved councils.\n\nThe U.S. operations of Stellantis received the following awards for our focus on diversity during 2022:\n\n- Top 3 Supplier Diversity Program out of 2,100 U.S. based companies - DiversityInc\n- Top Corporations for Minority Businesses, NMSDC\n- Presenting Sponsor Award, VOBRT\n- Top Corporations Award, WBENC\n- Best in Class Award 2022, Great Lakes WBC\n- ACE Awards: President\u2019s Award, Mark Stewart\n- Rainbow PUSH, Benchmark Award\n\nStellantis also supported inclusion across our supply base through the North American 23rd annual Matchmaker event, which creates opportunities for diverse suppliers. Matchmaker events provide minority-owned, women-owned and veteran-owned businesses access to our Tier I suppliers and to decision makers within our procurement organization. In 2022, the event featured over 150 exhibitors and over 1,000 attendees, including over 200 diverse business owners and over 100 Tier I supplier decision-makers.\n\nTraining, mentorship, scholarship support, sponsorships, membership and Board and committee participation are some of the ways we support organizations, which include:\n\n- Billion Dollar Roundtable\n- National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce\n- National Minority Supplier Development Council\n- DisabilityIN\n- Canadian Aboriginal and Minority Supplier Council\n\nWe work to include diversity and inclusion considerations as an everyday practice in our dealings with our employees, our dealers, our suppliers and our customers.\n7.2.8 DETAILED KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n7.2.8.1 Actions implemented on Labor and human rights by Stellantis suppliers\n\n| Category                                                                 | 2022 | 2021 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Actions on employee health and safety issues                             |      |      |\n| Suppliers assessed by Ecovadis                                          | 90%  | 68%  |\n| Evidence of actions on child labor, forced labor & human trafficking    |      |      |\n| 2022                                                                     | 64%  | N/A  |\n| 2021                                                                     |      |      |\n| Reporting on health and safety indicators                                |      |      |\n| 2022                                                                     | 37%  | 60%  |\n| 2021                                                                     |      |      |\n| Global Compact Signatory                                                 |      |      |\n| 2022                                                                     | 20%  | 41%  |\n| 2021                                                                     |      |      |\n\nWe support organizations by training, mentorship, scholarship support, sponsorships, membership and Board and committee participation.\n7.3 Philanthropic actions to support communities\n\n7.3.1 CONTEXT AND STELLANTIS POSITION\n\nCSR issue/challenge #22: Philanthropic actions to support communities\n\nAs a corporate citizen, Stellantis wants to make a positive contribution to society in the countries where we operate. We want to share with our communities our values, knowledge and resources through our philanthropic actions. The world is changing very fast due to the impact from many major events (the war in the Ukraine, COVID-19, resources scarcity, growing inflation, climate change). Stellantis wants to mitigate the significant impact on people in their day-to-day lives and more specifically on people who have fewer options due to limited resources. We aim to support these people through mobility and educational projects and empower them while inspiring hope.\n\nCompany\u2019s public position\n\nStellantis, as a member of the Global Compact, plays a role in building a more stable, inclusive and sustainable society. By mobilizing financial and human resources to help Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO), Non-Profit Institutions (NPI) and support employee initiatives, we can develop and deploy philanthropic projects of general interest adapted to the specific needs of the communities in which we operate. The projects we implement are designed to have a positive impact in these communities.\n\n7.3.2 FORWARD-LOOKING VISION AND TARGETS\n\nCommitment scoreboard\n\nFollowing the merger of former Groupe PSA and FCA, in January 2021, Stellantis reorganized its philanthropic activity. In 2021 and 2022 Stellantis continued to focus on its previous engagements. In 2022, Stellantis disclosed its new philanthropy strategy aligned with \u201cDare Forward 2030\u201d Strategic Plan and focused on needs of vulnerable people in the communities where we operate:\n\nDriven by our societal commitment, we empower people through access to mobility and education.\n\nThe first implementation phase of this strategy will start in 2024.\n### CSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE\n\n| CSR ISSUE/CHALLENGE | VISION/AMBITION | STRATEGIC KPIs | COMMITMENT | RESULTS |\n|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|---------|\n| Philanthropic actions to support communities | Driven by our societal commitment, we empower people through access to mobility and education | Amount of budget for philanthropy | Short-term: 2023: at least \u20ac15 million dedicated to philanthropy + all philanthropic projects focused on the new philanthropic strategy* | 2022: Stellantis managed the former commitments from the legacy charitable entities |\n| | | | Medium-term (End of Strategic Plan): 2030: at least \u20ac15 million dedicated to philanthropy + at least one philanthropic project in each region* | 2021: Stellantis managed the former commitments from the legacy charitable entities |\n| | | | Long-term: 2038: at least \u20ac15 million dedicated to philanthropy + at least one philanthropic project in each region and for each philanthropic focus areas* | |\n\n* Amount decided on a yearly basis, based on Stellantis current performance and general economy financial trend, and benchmark with OEM involvement in philanthropy.\n\n### 7.3.3 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n#### RISKS\n\n**Business risk:**\nCertain countries where we have strategic plans to operate or current operations require philanthropic activities to fulfill contractual legal expectations. The risk is to support projects that are not adapted to the community priorities and are not socially impactful.\n\n- Stellantis corporate philanthropy strategy supports projects only in the countries where we operate and provided by recognized NGOs or NPIs that are locally well respected in focus countries to create innovative philanthropic projects.\n- Stellantis supports employee volunteer projects in which we could have an added value.\n\n**Operational management risk:**\nDonation requests received by Stellantis, as a big company, exceeds the amount of its philanthropic allocated resources. Refusals might deteriorate relationships with NGOs and local communities because we cannot support all of them.\n\n- Stellantis will fund the independent Stellantis Foundation, formerly known as \u201cFCA Foundation\u201d, based on the company\u2019s financial performance and management assessment\n- Stellantis Foundation and its trustees identify and recommend projects to third party Grant making partner\n- Stellantis Foundation terms and conditions will be executed by a third-party grant making partner which will vet all NGOs against compliance requirements, secure grants applications and agreements and execute grant payments.\n- The high number of projects received allows Stellantis to select the most innovative employee volunteerism projects.\n- Stellantis philanthropic strategy supports actions to strengthen our connection to local communities while respecting their cultures and traditions.\n- Multi-year projects with larger funding are more impactful.\n\n**Reputational risk:**\nDonation requests may come from organizations whose behavior or actions are not in line with Stellantis values.\n\n- Stellantis will make an annual contribution to the independent Stellantis Foundation, which will work with a grant-making organization to conduct a thorough review and validation of all NGOs consistent with our code of conduct and all laws in order to guard against reputational risk.\n- Stellantis may identify qualified employee volunteer opportunities based on the qualified grants advised by the Stellantis Foundation.\n- Employees could be engaged to volunteer for projects to reinforce their sense of belonging.\n\n#### MITIGATION\n\n- Through an employee nomination process there will be the opportunity to identify, experiment, extend or spread successful projects in other countries.\n- We can bring forward new innovative projects.\n\n#### OPPORTUNITIES\n\n- The high number of projects received allows Stellantis to select the most innovative employee volunteerism projects.\n- Stellantis philanthropic strategy supports actions to strengthen our connection to local communities while respecting their cultures and traditions.\n- Multi-year projects with larger funding are more impactful.\n7.3.4 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION BODIES TO LEAD ACTIONS\n\nStellantis philanthropic activities are organized in three channels:\n\nThe Stellantis Foundation is the philanthropic arm of Stellantis. The Stellantis Foundation (formerly known as \u201cFCA Foundation\u201d renamed in 2022) is a separate legal entity under U.S. IRS regulations. In 2023, the Stellantis Foundation will administer the global grantmaking program and will develop a process to allow consideration of employee-nominated projects. Under the leadership of Foundation Chairman, John Elkann, a board of Trustees governs the Stellantis Foundation. They approve the philanthropy strategy and the main engagement areas and they select the projects to advise for funding. Stellantis makes an annual donation to the Stellantis Foundation.\n\nCorporate donations to NGOs or NPOs for emergency aid (COVID-19 pandemic, humanitarian to Ukraine), social issues or business related activities in the communities in partnership with charities are proposed for 2022 by the Head of Philanthropy or relevant EVPs to the CEO for approval.\n\nEmployee volunteerism is under the responsibility of the Chief Human Resources & Transformation Officer, member of the Top Executive Team. These programs are aligned with the Philanthropy strategy and shared with regional and country HR teams.\n\n2022 STELLANTIS KEY FIGURES\n\n- **\u20ac19.7 mln** Dedicated to philanthropic projects\n- **124** Philanthropic projects supported\n- **4,779** Hours volunteered by employees\n\nIn 2022, Stellantis demonstrated its corporate citizenship and supported 124 philanthropic projects (versus 100 in 2021) around the world through our corporate foundation and direct corporate giving for a total amount of \u20ac19.7 million (versus \u20ac14.4 million in 2021). Stellantis managed the transition to the new philanthropic focus. We mainly continued to support multi-year projects that started before the merger. The legacy charitable entities managed their former commitments on the basis of their previous governance.\n\nThe 2022 year was dedicated to the redesign and reorganization of the philanthropy strategy and activities including working on proposals for a new governance structure. The new philanthropy ambition engagement areas will be announced in 2023.\n7.3.5 POLICIES TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY\n\nStellantis charitable donations\n\nStellantis supports the vulnerable in our communities with two types of projects:\n\n- Educational projects that meet the needs and expectations of the communities with a focus on STEM and literacy\n- Mobility projects that lift the barriers to access to education and employment.\n\nStellantis philanthropy strategy contributes to some of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The social contributions focused on education to empower people and build resilient communities with effects that can extend generations into the future. Investments were made in programs that generated meaningful and measurable impact in our communities, with an emphasis on STEM, literacy education improvement and problem-solving and in youth development.\n\nIn 2022, Stellantis corporate giving initiatives and charitable contributions were made to support local community needs in the countries where Stellantis operated. Donations were made in healthcare, disaster relief, environment protection and conservation, veterans support and community events including support of Ukrainian refugees and civilians displaced by the war in the Ukraine.\n\nEmployee volunteerism:\n\nStellantis encourages employees to address the societal needs of the communities in which they live and work through employee volunteerism programs. In 2021, these programs focused on quality education and creating sustainable cities and communities were proposed in 3 regions North America, South America, and China. In 2022, they were expanded in the other regions India Asia Pacific, Enlarged Europe and Middle East Africa through pilot programs. The volunteer engagement areas are:\n\n- Education (STEM, mentoring, tutoring and literacy)\n- Basic needs (food security, shelter & clothing, natural disasters)\n- Environment (Invasive species, watershed, conservation, gardens)\n- Resilient and sustainable communities (beautification, house builds, cultural heritage)\n\n713 employees (versus 1,117 in 2021) around the world supported 59 projects (versus 47 projects in 2021) representing more than 4,779 hours of working time versus 6,249 hours of working time in 2021.\n7.3.6 ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES\n\nStellantis has a diversified approach to corporate citizenship and uses different types and categories of donations to support communities in the most efficient way. In 2022, many Stellantis entities, under the control of the philanthropy team, donated to NGOs or non-profit organizations to help the people in need in the communities where we operate.

In 2022, Stellantis has focused its projects on emergency aid, education philanthropic initiatives and employee volunteerism program. The Stellantis achievements support our focus to create positive social and environmental impacts.\n\nTotal monetary values and number of projects distributed by focus areas in 2022\n\n- **85%**\n  - **EDUCATION**\n  - 41 PROJECTS - \u20ac 16,621,929\n\n- **10%**\n  - **ENVIRONMENTAL, CULTURAL, SOCIAL URGENCY, FOOD DISTRIBUTION (INCLUDING PREVENTING NUTRITIOUS FOOD WASTE), AND OTHERS**\n  - 79 PROJECTS - \u20ac 2,022,359\n\n- **5%**\n  - **EMERGENCY AID**\n  - 4 PROJECTS - \u20ac 1,069,792\n\n7.3.7.1 SUPPORT TO EMERGENCY AID\n\n**Support to Ukraine**\n\nStellantis mobilized in March 2022 to help Ukrainians, we donated \u20ac1 million in humanitarian aid to support the Ukrainian refugees and civilians displaced by the war.\n\nThis donation to Polish Humanitarian Action helped thousands of war victims with immediate humanitarian needs, including food and hygiene kits, as well as cash assistance. It also includes activities like psychological support, support for internally displaced people and centers helping internally displaced people, or the distribution of food and hygiene parcels.\n\n**Flood victims' assistance in Brazil**\n\nIn 2022, Heavy rains hit the region near the Stellantis Goiana plant and Porto Real factory putting many families out of their home. Stellantis South America supported almost 3,000 homeless families through the donation of food, personal items, cleaning items, pillows and blankets. The Fiat Dealership Network also participated by mobilizing customer donations in favor of the victims.\n\n---\n\n**PRESS RELEASE**\n\nStellantis Donates \u20ac1 Million to Ukrainian Refugees and Civilians\n\nhttps://www.stellantis.com/en/news/press-releases/2022/march/stellantis-donates-1-million-to-ukrainian-refugees-and-civilians#:~:text=March%202%2C%202022%20Stellantis%20Donates%20%E2%82%AC1%20Million%20to%20refugees%20and%20civilians%20displaced%20by%20the%20current%20crisis.\n7.3.7.2 SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE EDUCATIONAL PROJECTS\n\nScientific Education\n\nUnveiled in 2019 in Geneva, Switzerland, CERN is a Science Gateway project, a hub for scientific education and culture. In 2021, CERN held a first stone ceremony attended by Stellantis Chairman John Elkann, as the next step in the creation of the Science Gateway. Supported by the FCA Foundation, the ambitious and innovative Science Gateway project is expected to raise awareness, curiosity and passion for science. CERN will offer a variety of spaces and activities, with exhibitions explaining the secrets of nature, the very small elementary particles and the very large structure and evolution of the universe. The exhibitions will feature CERN\u2019s accelerators, experiments and computing, how scientists use them in their exploration and how CERN technologies benefit society. Hands-on experimentation will be a key part of the Science Gateway\u2019s educational program, allowing visitors to experience first-hand what it is like to be a scientist. The immersive activities available in the Science Gateway will foster critical thinking, evidence-based assessment and use of the scientific method, which are important tools in all walks of life. The building supported through the grant is expected to be ready in May 2023. The school project also is progressing, with plans to train the first 100 teachers in Spring 2023.\n\nEmployment development skills\n\nIn 2022 a Stellantis Foundation grant supported 80 high-school-level FIRST Robotics teams, many mentored by Stellantis employees, as well as the state championship event in Michigan. The Foundation served as volunteer sponsor of the event, attended by 4,800 students on 160 teams and 2,200 engineers, mentors, volunteers and spectators. FIRST (For inspiration and Recognition of Science and technology) is an international program designed to increase student interest in STEM activities and encourage students to pursue a career or skilled trade in a STEM-related field.\n\nMentoring program\n\nStellantis, together with the non-profit association Instituto \u00c1rvore da Vida, supports \u00c1rvore da Vida (Tree of Life) the social project in the Jardim Teres\u00f3polis community, near the Stellantis plant in Betim (Brazil). The program, which began in 2004, aims to promote social, cultural and economic growth of independence and empowerment of local residents while providing support for the children and their families. In this after-school project there are two main areas of focus, one is professional inclusion and the other is social inclusion through cultural development. Children ages 2 to 17 participated in various training programs to prepare them for professional development and employment. The children also participated in cultural activities such as music classes and choir. Youth learn collaboration, teamwork, public speaking and other soft skills. 2021 marked the 17th anniversary of this project. More than 23,600 people have benefited from the program since its inception. In 2022, the project launched a new Coworking Space with the aim of promoting integration and learning for program beneficiaries and community members. In its first year, Coworking trained 30 community leaders in social project management and became a reference in the neighborhood as a place to discuss challenges, develop projects and engage people who want to improve the quality of life in their community.\n7.3.7.3 EMPLOYEE VOLUNTEERISM PROGRAM\n\nNorth America\nFor four years, Stellantis has supported the United Service Organizations Inc. (USO) through its employee volunteerism program. The USO strengthens the United States\u2019 military members throughout their service, connecting them to family, home and country. In 2022, nearly 150 Stellantis employees teamed up with the USO, dedicating approximately 700 total hours to assemble 10,033 care packages to be distributed to U.S. troops deployed overseas.\n\nSouth America\nIn Brazil, Stellantis has partnered with Formare - a kids education program - for the last 14 years. Employees started a nine-month program with FORMARE in 2022 to offer a professional and quality education to young people in need. Ten Stellantis volunteers have committed a total of 200 hours to more than 20 students who are a part of the program.\n\nMiddle East & Africa\nForty-five Stellantis employees organized a special project in a new collaboration with the Moroccan Association for the Support of the Orphan. Employees spent 360 hours renovating the orphanage\u2019s main cafeteria, establishing a library and gathering school supplies to benefit approximately 180 kids.\n\nEnlarged Europe\nIn 2022, Stellantis employees in the U.K. connected for the first time with Coventry Holiday Activities and Food (HAF). HAF provides free activities, experiences and food for eligible children and young people during school holidays. Approximately 26 employees spent 84 total hours packing, wrapping and delivering activity boxes to local children with special needs.\n8 APPENDIX\n\n8.1 REPORTING SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY\n   8.1.1 methodology for building the CSR reporting perimeter\n   8.1.2 Breakdowns of information provided\n\n8.2 INDEXES\n   8.2.1 TCFD\n   8.2.2 SASB\n   8.2.3 ISO 26000\n   8.2.4 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) content index\n   8.2.5 UN GLOBAL COMPACT principles index with related GRI codes\n   8.2.6 DPEF\n\n8.3 AUDITOR\u2019S REPORT\n\n8.4 SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT\n\n8.5 ABOUT THIS REPORT\n8.1 Reporting scope and methodology\n\nStellantis consolidates and publishes indicators according to three guiding principles: being transparent, being thorough and providing high-quality information.\n\nThe definitions of calculation rules or reference conventions used are international standards. Reference guides specifying the methodologies, definitions and calculation procedures are used by the reporting contributors to ensure the quality and consistency of the consolidated information. Unless otherwise indicated, all data presented in the report refers to the International System of Units and may be subject to rounding.\n\nInformation presented in the report, follows a Pro Forma approach which has been prepared to give effect to completion of the merger of PSA and FCA to create Stellantis, which was completed on January 17, 2021, as if it had been completed on January 1, 2020.\n\nThe normalization factor for manufacturing activities adopted in chapters 2.6, 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6 is 5,768 thousand vehicles produced.\n\nIn this report, unless otherwise specified, the terms \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, \u201cits\u201d, \u201cCompany\u201d and \u201cStellantis\u201d refer to Stellantis N.V., together with its subsidiaries and its predecessor prior to the completion of the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. with Peugeot SA or any one or more of them, as the context may require.\n\n8.1.1 METHODOLOGY FOR BUILDING THE CSR REPORTING PERIMETER\n\nThe CSR scope of reporting is set up from the financial scope of reporting.\n\nThe CSR scope of reporting covers the fully consolidated companies (consolidated line by line) and does not consider entities accounted for by the equity method or valued at cost in the consolidated financial statements, except where noted.\n\nSelected entities or specific sites are excluded from the scope of reporting for some CSR issues. This is attributable to the inability to obtain data of satisfactory quality, or to immateriality in relation to the Company as a whole, or to newly-acquired entities or activities that are not fully operational, in the start up phase, under dismissal or sold during the reporting year. For this reason, to determine the CSR scope of reporting, different filters are applied.\n\nFor more information on Stellantis entities included in the consolidated financial statements, refer to the 2022 Annual Report, available on the corporate website.\n\nFor environmental-related information included in sections 2.6 and 6.3-6.7 of this Report, the following definitions are applied:\n\n- \u201cManufacturing\u201d: relates to plants activities and includes also proving grounds and technical, R&D and ICT centers.\n- \u201cRetail\u201d: relates to Company-owned sales and after-sales activities, retail offices (such as import subsidiaries) and logistics activities (spare parts warehouses and distribution centers).\nThe sites included in the definitions above, are assessed to determine the inclusion in the scope of reporting against specific thresholds based on: number of employees working onsite, size (m\u00b2) and other criteria.\n\nA selection of sites in the Retail group, apply a different reporting period (November 1 - October 31) to allow data collection and validation by the time of the release of this Report.\n\nInformation related to vehicles and services offered to customers, such as those presented in sections 2.5 and 4.1-4.3 of this Report, may include data on vehicles produced and/or service offered by unconsolidated joint ventures.\n\nReferences to \"customer\" as used in this Report refer to the end user of our products or services.\n\nFor human resources-related information included in Chapter 3, workforce KPIs are based on the CSR scope 2022. Legal entities joining Stellantis less than six month ago or out from the HR consolidation tool are not taken into account.\n\n**Comau:**\n\nThe non-financial information related to the subsidiary Comau is not included in Stellantis consolidated non-financial statement, since Comau significance is not material to the whole. The impact on main industrial issues (water, energy, GHG emission, air emission and waste) is not material, meanings lower than 5%.\n\nSome entities published their own report.\n\n**Aramis:**\n\nThe non-financial information related to the subsidiary Aramis, that counts 1,800 employees, is not included in Stellantis consolidated non-financial statement, since Aramis significance is not material to the whole. Aramis represents less than 1% of total turnover, total headcount and total GHG emissions of Stellantis consolidated data. Consequently, the non-financial information of Aramis has no impact on the consolidated statement established by Stellantis. It cannot affect the sincerity and the conformity of the Stellantis consolidated statement with regards to the applicable law (NFRD).\n\nIn addition, as Aramis has its own risk management, policies, and set of KPIs that are specific to its activities, the efforts to report Aramis non-financial information in accordance with Stellantis frameworks would not be in proportion, taking in consideration Aramis' representativity of less than 1%.\n\nNevertheless, transparency duty is fulfilled as, being a listed company, Aramis publishes its own Registration Document in accordance with the NFRD: Regulated information - Aramis Group. Thus, interested stakeholders can access to the required information.\n8.1.2 BREAKDOWNS OF INFORMATION PROVIDED\n\nSegments\n\nStellantis activities are carried out through six reportable segments: five regional vehicle segments and Maserati. These reportable segments reflect the operating segments of the Company that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer, who is the \u201cchief operating decision maker\u201d, for making strategic decisions, allocating resources and assessing performance, and that exceed the quantitative threshold provided in IFRS 8 \u2013 Operating Segments (\u201cIFRS 8\u201d), or whose information is considered useful for the users of the financial statements.\n\nThe Company\u2019s five regional vehicle reportable segments deal with the design, engineering, development, manufacturing, distribution and sale of passenger cars, light commercial vehicles and related parts and services in specific geographic areas:\n\n- North America (U.S., Canada and Mexico),\n- South America (including Central America and the Caribbean islands),\n- Enlarged Europe (primarily the countries of the European Union, United Kingdom and Russia),\n- Middle East and Africa (primarily Turkey, Morocco, Egypt and Algeria) and\n- China and India & Asia Pacific (Asia and Pacific countries).\n\nThe Company\u2019s global luxury brand reportable segment, Maserati, deals with the design, engineering, development, manufacturing, worldwide distribution and sale of luxury vehicles under the Maserati brand.\n\nOther activities includes the results of our cast iron and aluminum components business, our financial services activities, as well as the activities and businesses that are not operating segments under IFRS 8.\n\nThe breakdown by segments is adopted in a limited set of data within this Report.\n\nGeographical Areas\n\nIn order to simplify the understanding of the reader, the majority of information is provided considering the geographical distribution of where activities are located to reflect where impacts occur.\n\nFor this reason, the Maserati and Other sectors\u2019 information are realigned into the 5 geographic areas:\n\n- North America (U.S., Canada and Mexico),\n- South America (including Central America and the Caribbean islands),\n- Enlarged Europe (primarily the countries of the European Union, United Kingdom and Russia),\n- Middle East and Africa (primarily Turkey, Morocco, Egypt and Algeria) and\n- China and India & Asia Pacific (Asia and Pacific countries).\n### 8.2 Indexes\n\n#### 8.2.1 TCFD\n\nThe following table provides the

auditor\u2019s opinion on the truthfulness of the selection of the consolidated social, societal and environmental information presented in the CSR Report. The firm Grant Thornton was appointed as independent auditor. The conclusions of this report are presented below.\n\nASSURANCE REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS\n\nTo the Shareholders,\n\nOur conclusions\n\nWe have examined a selection of KPIs included in the accompanying Corporate Social Responsibility report (hereafter: CSR report) for the year 2022 of Stellantis N.V based in Amsterdam. Our examination is aimed to obtain limited assurance for a selection of KPIs (hereafter: the limited assurance KPIs), and reasonable assurance for an additional selection of KPIs (hereafter: reasonable assurance KPIs).\n\nOur limited assurance conclusion\n\nBased on our review nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the limited assurance KPIs are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria as included in the section \u201creporting criteria\u201d of this assurance report.\n\nOur reasonable assurance opinion\n\nIn our opinion the reasonable assurance KPIs are prepared, in all materials aspects, in accordance with the reporting criteria as included in the section \u201creporting criteria\u201d of this assurance report.\n\nOther information\n\nBased on our examination, we conclude that the other information included in the CSR Report is consistent with the selected KPI\u2019s.\n\nBasis for our conclusions\n\nWe performed our examination in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3000A \u2018Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information\u2019. Our responsibilities under this standard are further described in the section \u2018Our responsibilities for the examination of the limited assurance KPI\u2019s and reasonable assurance KPI\u2019s\u2019 of our report.\nWe are independent of Stellantis N.V in accordance with the \u2018Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten\u2019 (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in The Netherlands. Furthermore we have complied with the \u2018Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants\u2019 (VGBA, Dutch code of ethics).\n\nWe believe that the assurance evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusions.\n\n**Reporting criteria**\n\nThe reporting criteria used for the preparation of the selected KPIs are the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the applied supplemental reporting criteria as disclosed in section \u20188 Appendix\u2019 of the CSR report \u2018Methodology and scope of Non-Financial Information\u2019.\n\nThe absence of an established practice on which to draw, to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time. Consequently, the sustainability information needs to be read and understood together with the reporting criteria used.\n\n**Materiality**\n\nBased on our professional judgement we determined materiality levels for the selected KPI\u2019s. When evaluating our materiality levels, we have taken into account quantitative and qualitative considerations as well as the relevance of information for both stakeholders and the company.\n\n**Scope of the group examination**\n\nStellantis N.V is the parent company of a group of entities. The selected KPIs incorporate the consolidated information of this group of entities to the extent as specified in \u20188. Appendix\u2019 in the CSR report.\n\nOur examination consisted of both assurance procedures at corporate (consolidated) level and at site level. Our selection of sites in scope of our review procedures and our audit procedures are primarily based on the site\u2019s individual contribution to the consolidated information. Furthermore, our selection of sites considered relevant reporting risks and geographical spread.\n\nBy performing our review procedures and audit procedures at site level, together with additional review procedures and audit procedures at corporate level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate assurance evidence about the group\u2019s selected KPI\u2019s to provide a conclusion about the selected limited assurance KPI\u2019s and the selected reasonable assurance KPI\u2019s.\nIt is not our responsibility to comment on:\n\n- the entity\u2019s compliance with other applicable legal and regulatory requirements;\n- the compliance of products and services with the applicable regulations.\n\n**Responsibilities of the management board for the selected KPIs**\n\nThe management board is responsible for the preparation of reliable and adequate KPI\u2019s in accordance with the reporting criteria as included in the section \u2018reporting criteria\u2019, including the identification of stakeholders and the definition of material matters.\n\nThe management board is also responsible for selecting and applying the reporting criteria and for determining that these reporting criteria are suitable for the legitimate information needs of stakeholders, taking into account applicable laws and regulations related to reporting. The choices made by the management board regarding the scope of the KPI\u2019s and the reporting policy are summarized in section \u20188. Appendix\u2019 of the CSR report.\n\nFurthermore, the management board is responsible for such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the KPI\u2019s that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n**Our responsibilities for the examination of the limited assurance KPI\u2019s and reasonable assurance KPI\u2019s**\n\nOur responsibility is to plan and perform our examination in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate assurance evidence for our conclusions.\n\nOur examination performed to obtain limited assurance on the limited assurance KPIs differ in nature and timing and are less extent as compared to reasonable assurance engagements. The level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is therefore substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.\n\nOur examination to obtain reasonable assurance on the reasonable assurance KPI\u2019s has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not have detected all material errors and fraud.\n\nWe apply the \u2018Nadere voorschriften kwaliteitssystemen\u2019 (NVKS, Regulations for Quality management systems) and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and other relevant legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nOur examination included among others:\n\n- Performing an analysis of the external environment and obtaining an understanding of relevant social themes and issues, and the characteristics of the Company;\n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting criteria used, their consistent application and related disclosures in the selected KPIs;\nObtaining an understanding of the reporting processes for the selected KPIs, including obtaining a general understanding of internal control relevant to our procedures;\n\nIdentifying areas of the selected KPIs with a higher risk of misleading or unbalanced information or material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nDesigning and performing further assurance procedures aimed at determining the plausibility of the selected KPIs responsive to this risk analysis. These procedures consisted amongst others of:\n\nInterviewing management and relevant staff at corporate and local level responsible for the sustainability strategy, policy and results;\n\nInterviewing relevant staff responsible for providing the information for, carrying out internal control procedures on, and consolidating the data for the selected KPIs;\n\nDetermining the nature and extent of our procedures for the group components and locations.
