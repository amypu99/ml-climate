Just as the COVID-19 pandemic began to ease, supply chain disruptions worsened, inflation surged and energy shortages took hold. The invasion of Ukraine and its knock-on effects were also felt around the world. Every business, community and household faced tough choices in navigating our turbulent world.\n\nNestl\u00e9 remains committed to nutrition, health and wellness. The company has made great progress in reducing the sodium, sugar and saturated fat in its products over the past decade and that work continues. At the same time, we are working to advance regenerative food systems and help address food security. Drawing on our strong foundation in Creating Shared Value we focus our energy and resources to make faster progress, raise standards and drive change in the way, and do so in part, through our continued support for initiatives that seek to drive change, such as the UN Global Compact.\n\nAfter years of progress, the recent rise in food insecurity is deeply concerning. Our commitment to maintaining everyday basic food supplies and providing affordable nutrition is unwavering. In 2022, we delivered approximately 130 billion servings of affordable nutrition fortified with at least one of the \u201cbig four\u201d micronutrients: iron, iodine, vitamin A and zinc.\n\nWith this report, Nestl\u00e9 becomes the first company to disclose the nutritional value of its entire global portfolio. We have benchmarked all in-scope products using the Health Star Rating (HSR) system \u2013 a nutrient profiling system applied by the Access to Nutrition Initiative (ATNI) \u2013 and we have also disclosed sales from our wide range of specialized nutrition products, which are not covered by the HSR system.\n\nAs a global company, we have a role to play in international efforts to combat societal issues. In 2022, Nestl\u00e9 experts participated in discussions in support of the UN Treaty on Plastic Pollution, the UN Climate Change Conference (COP27) in Egypt, the UN Biodiversity Conference (COP15) in Montreal and World Water Week, to name just a few. While some may doubt our motives and question the level of corporate influence in international negotiations like these, in reality, we are there to push for policymakers to lead the way, and do so in part, through our continued support for initiatives that seek to drive change, such as the UN Global Compact.\n\nAfter the invasion of Ukraine, our focus has been on keeping our employees and their families safe, maintaining our Ukrainian operations wherever possible and supporting the Ukrainian people. Nestl\u00e9 has committed more than CHF 55 million to the people of Ukraine, including our recent CHF 40 million investment in a new production facility, underlining our commitment to helping the country rebuild.\n\nNew regulations mean that from 2024, our sustainability reporting will no longer be a voluntary exercise. We are proud to have been a leader in sustainability reporting over the past fifteen years and, as these regulations are implemented, aim to continue our leadership in both transparency and performance. We invite you to read and enjoy this report and share your feedback with us.\n\nWelcome to the Nestl\u00e9 Creating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2022. We report on the topics that are most material to our stakeholders and our business. In this report we cover our approach and performance on each topic, supported with expert voices and case studies.\n\nChairman\n\nPaul Bulcke\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nU.

As per Ellen MacArthur Foundation definitions.\nAt Nestl\u00e9, we are making it our business to advance regenerative food systems at scale \u2013 our own resilience and success depend on it.\n\nAs 2023 began, much of the northern hemisphere was gripped by extreme weather. Across North America a so-called \u201conce in a century freeze\u201d swept death and destruction for some, and chaos and disruption for many. In Europe, extraordinary warmth triggered a welcome fall in gas prices but saw meteorological records tumble throughout the continent. Meanwhile, countries from Australia to Nigeria and Pakistan were still recovering from the devastating floods experienced in 2022. Climate change is now a lived experience, not a future projection. For a company as dependent on agriculture as Nestl\u00e9, this matters \u2013 greatly \u2013 and is why we are so determined to play our part by reaching net zero no later than 2050.\n\nIn last year\u2019s report, we set out the case for action to advance regenerative food systems. Of course, 2022 saw many unexpected and extreme challenges. Notwithstanding these, we stayed true to our course and, as we survey our progress to date, it is even clearer that we are on the right path. Indeed, it is the only truly pragmatic course to take.\n\nClimate achievements\nIn terms of achievements during the year, our greenhouse gas emissions fell below our 2018 baseline for the first time, despite company growth. Our emissions fell by 6.4 million tonnes compared with a business-as-usual-scenario, and we will endeavor to further reduce them, even as we grow.\n\nAt Nestl\u00e9, we recognize that immediate actions and reductions are needed so we have taken steps to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. However, the greater part of our emissions is from Scope 3 and this is where our promise to advance regenerative food systems at scale is coming to life. We recognize that achieving net zero is not possible unless there are actions taken to fight deforestation and to restore degraded forests and plant new trees.\n\nThis is why we are so committed to our Forest Positive strategy. This strategy puts people at the center, with concern for livelihoods, land rights and human rights. For maximum and long-lasting impact, our actions must be taken in a context that goes beyond the farmgate and into our broader sourcing landscape.\n\nWe also know that it is not possible for us to achieve net zero without fully scaling up regenerative agriculture practices. We are adopting a similar, people-centric approach as we have for forests by supporting farmers to make the transition to regenerative agriculture. During 2022, we worked closely with farmers around the world to help them adopt practices that will help store carbon in soil while improving soil health, biodiversity, and water security and quality. In an external context, the concept of a \u201cjust transition\u201d was frequently discussed during 2022 and at Nestl\u00e9 we are playing our part in the move from concept to delivery.\n\nNo stone left unturned\nOf course, emissions from some commodities such as dairy are higher than others. We are exploring \u2013 and deploying \u2013 a wide variety of tools to make deep and rapid cuts in methane emissions. Some stakeholders would have us diversify from dairy altogether. That is not our way. The atmosphere makes no distinction between who owns the source of emissions and simply transferring ownership somewhere else will not help. We are committed to driving those emissions down and that is what we are doing.\n\nThere was some welcome progress in the international arena in 2022. While progress at the COP27 Climate Conference was less than hoped for, it was far better than many had feared. And the UN Biodiversity Conference agreement to protect and preserve 30% of the planet and 30% of degraded ecosystems by 2030 showed that international agreement is possible, and we look forward to playing our part in delivering on this goal. The Uruguay round of talks in pursuit of a legally binding global plastics treaty was another important step forward on a highly complex issue. As a final note, our presence at such international events, along with many other like-minded businesses, is to encourage policymakers to act. We want to see a \u201chigh-level playing field\u201d and we will continue to raise our voice in pursuit of a just transition to a net zero and regenerative food system. All of our advocacy activities are carried out in line with the aims and ambitions of the Paris Climate Agreement.\nStrategy overview\n\nOur purpose is to unlock the power of food to enhance quality of life for everyone, today and for generations to come. Creating Shared Value is the way we set out to achieve this purpose. It is an approach to business that seeks to be good for us, our shareholders, society and the planet. Our value creation strategy builds from this foundation in our product portfolio.\n\nA climate-centered approach\n\nThe climate crisis is exacerbating the global food crisis. An unsustainable food system \u2013 responsible for up to a third of the world\u2019s emissions \u2013 is making the problem worse. We must move rapidly to a better way of nourishing our growing population, equitably, affordably and sustainably.\n\nThis is why we want to accelerate the shift to regenerative farming in this decade. By 2030, we expect half of our key ingredient volumes will come from farmers engaged in practices that enrich the soils, replenish natural water cycles and/or soak up carbon. Building on actions that ensure our key supply chains are deforestation-free, we are applying this same regenerative mindset to help local communities protect forests and restore ecosystems. We want to help preserve the natural resources that all aspects of life, food and our business rely on.\n\nConsumer appetite for change is accelerating, too. Our reach means we have a unique opportunity to deliver on and drive up demand for sustainable, nutritious diets. This is why we are reformulating our products, rapidly expanding our portfolio of plant-based choices and working with farmers to rethink every dimension of dairy to become net zero. Good food is at the center of our business, so we want to use the breadth of our products and brands to make sustainable choices available and attractive to everyone, everywhere.\n\nEven as we grow, we will continue to endeavor to drive down our emissions and get to net zero. We aim to halve our carbon footprint this decade from 2018 levels and will report our progress, transparently. To achieve that, we are working on transforming every aspect of our business \u2013 from switching our trucks to alternative fuels and our factories to renewable electricity, to improving circular packaging solutions that reduce plastic and can be more easily recycled or reused. These transformations are not just good for the climate: becoming a business that puts regeneration at the core of our company reduces our costs and makes us more resilient \u2013 and this is good for Nestl\u00e9, too.\n\nOur B Corp-certified brands\n\nIn April 2022, Nespresso became B Corp-certified, joining a global community of businesses that meet the highest standards of sustainability and social responsibility. Nestl\u00e9 Health Sciences North America also achieved this certification in November. The move means that approximately 10% of Nestl\u00e9 global sales are now B-Corp certified.\n\nHow our brands are contributing to our strategy.\n\nOur brands play a critical role in delivering our global sustainability commitments. Each brand\u2019s contribution is unique, reflecting the differing sustainability challenges and opportunities that each category faces. Yet collectively, their efforts cumulate in our corporate sustainability impact.\n\nWith this in mind, we have developed the Brand Contribution Framework, to help each brand identify the role they will play in helping us achieve our corporate goals. Our brands identify how they can best contribute across three commitment areas: People, families and pets, People and planet, and People in communities. Once they have identified the topics within each area to focus on, each brand makes a sustainability promise, with supporting actions and indicators for measuring progress, and selects minimum one area where they want to lead the way in comparison with their peers. The brands\u2019 actions are then brought to life through our packaging and communications, to inform our consumers who increasingly are seeking to make sustainable choices.\n\nBrands in action\n\nThere are plenty of examples among our well-known brands. Purina PetCare has been working with farmers in France to improve soil health and sequester carbon since 2020. Nestl\u00e9 Waters is working at a local level, from national parkland in Spain to farmlands in Pakistan, to help regenerate the local water cycle. The Nestl\u00e9 Waters brands don\u2019t see regenerative practices as one element of their sustainability promise, but as central to the entire effort.\n\nElsewhere, Gerber is taking action to deliver waste-free factories and carbon-neutral recipes, while Cenelac aims to source 100% of its key ingredients through regenerative agriculture methods by 2030 \u2013 well ahead of our global commitment of 2050.\n\nIt is exciting to see our brands taking ownership of their sustainability journeys and delivering meaningful impact.\nSound governance is integral to building trust and maintaining our license to operate. It is a cornerstone of our ability to create shared value.\n\nOur governance structure reflects our purpose, enables our strategy, and supports our commitments. Our environmental, social, governance (ESG) and sustainability strategy is at the heart of our decision-making. Full details of board-level remuneration and bonuses are available in our Compensation Report.\n\nThe ESG and Sustainability Council oversees our sustainability strategy. The Council is chaired by our Executive Vice President (EVP) Head of Strategic Business Units and Marketing and Sales. The Council has the following workstreams: 2050 Net Zero, Sustainable Packaging, Water, Sustainable Sourcing and Communications and Advocacy. The structure helps to accelerate and standardize decision-making on a global level.\n\nIn 2022, the Council welcomed three new members \u2013 the Head of Zone North America and the Head of Zone Greater China, as Nestl\u00e9 added two new geographical Zones to its management structure, and the Deputy EVP and Chief Communications Officer. The Council meets every month and regularly reports to the full Executive Board.\n\nWe monitor our Creating Shared Value and sustainability performance against key performance indicators using an internal dashboard. Performance data are generated on a quarterly basis and progress is reviewed by the ESG and Sustainability Council.\n\nFor full details of our governance structure, see our latest Corporate Governance Report.\nOur material topics\n\nIt is critical to identify our key risks and material issues. By understanding which topics impact our stakeholders and business the most, we can determine where our focus should be.\n\nThe world constantly changes. We need to stay on top of those changes and how they can affect our stakeholders and our operations. Specifically, we need to identify where Nestl\u00e9 has the greatest impact on society and the environment. We also need to know which topics have the greatest potential to influence our business success. This is why we carry out a comprehensive materiality assessment at least every two years.\n\nIn 2022, we worked with an independent third party to conduct desk research and interviews with 55 internal and external stakeholders. The desk research identified 29 short- and long-term material topics that were then explored during the interviews. The external stakeholders included suppliers, investors, customers, non-governmental organizations and business associations. Internally, they included executive board members, functional heads and market heads. Their respective tasks were to classify Nestl\u00e9\u2019s impact on each topic and each topic\u2019s impact on Nestl\u00e9.\n\nThe process was overseen by the ESG and Sustainability Council and the outcomes were reviewed by the Sustainability Committee of the Board. The results are helping us identify risks and opportunities and adjust our strategies and priorities accordingly.\n\nMateriality assessment results\n\nThe results of our 2022 materiality assessment are supporting decisions on where to focus our resources. Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is the process of identifying and addressing risk. The full alignment of our materiality and ERM processes help give us essential short- and long-term visibility on key topics.\n\nThe topics identified as among the most important by both internal and external stakeholders are:\n\n- Health and nutrition\n- Environmental and social impacts of the ingredient supply chain\n- Water management\n- Ecological impacts\n- Greenhouse gas emissions\n- Product quality and safety\n- Packaging lifecycle management\n\nSince 2020, ecological impacts (affecting natural resources, biodiversity and ecosystems) and circular economy were among the topics to have gained importance for both internal and external stakeholders. All these topics are covered in this report.\n\nRisk management\n\nAt a Group level, our approach to risk is aligned to our purpose, with a focus on operational, strategic, compliance and reputational risk across our financial and non-financial landscapes. A risk assessment at Group level is conducted annually.\n\nESG topics are built into our ERM process. This helps to ensure that the full range of sustainability topics are incorporated into the risks and opportunities that are considered across the company.\n\nRisks relating to the environmental and social impact of the supply chain, including exposure to human rights risks, are reviewed at Group management level. There is also a detailed supplier risk program in the procurement function. If required, cases relating to our risk assessment processes are escalated to the Executive Board and related findings are reflected in decision-making processes at an operational and strategic level.\n\nAs a business leader, we are committed to transparency and action on climate-related risks and opportunities. As such, we have aligned our reporting with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Our TCFD-aligned disclosures, including our analysis undertaken in 2022, can be found in our 2022 Climate Risk and Impact report.\n\nMateriality matrix\n\n| Impact of Nestl\u00e9 on people and the environment | Negligible | Moderate | Significant | Major |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|-------------|-------|\n| Animal welfare                                |           |          |             |       |\n| Air emissions                                 |           |          |             |       |\n| Business ethics                               |           |          |             |       |\n| Community relations                           |           |          |             |       |\n| Systemic risk management                      |           |          |             |       |\n| Critical risk management                      |           |          |             |       |\n| Management of the legal & regulatory environment |       |          |             |       |\n| Governance structures & mechanisms           |           |          |             |       |\n| Organizational set-up & efficiency            |           |          |             |       |\n| Data privacy management                       |           |          |             |       |\n| Cybersecurity & information security          |           |          |             |       |\n\nImportance and impact on Nestl\u00e9\u2019s business success\n\n- **Negligible**\n- **Moderate**\n- **Significant**\n- **Major**\n\n*Chapters Looking at the whole landscape and More regenerative practices on farms also cover this topic.\n**An Employer of choice also covers this topic.\n***Opportunities for young people also covers this topic.\n\nOur materiality process\n\n| Material topics selection | Establish external context | Stakeholder engagement | Materiality assessment | Review strategies | Publish in CSV and Sustainability Report |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) aligned material topics selected | All software analysis and analysis of environment | 55 interviews conducted and surveys collected | Quantitative and qualitative input assessed | Identify risks and opportunities in results and adjust priorities accordingly | Share results internally and externally |\n\nThe following chapters and accompanying reports provide more details on each material topic:\n\n- Advancing regeneration\n- On the road to net zero\n- Protecting biodiversity\n- Regenerating the water cycle\n- Ingredients produced sustainably\n- Human rights and resilient communities\n- Supporting tasty and balanced diets\n- Food safety and quality\n- Packaging and circularity\n- Our diverse and inclusive culture\n- An employer of choice\n- The foundations of ethical business\n- Annual Review\n- TCFD Report\n\nCreating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2022\nStakeholder engagement\n\nConsidering external feedback is fundamental to our approach.\n\nWe engage with stakeholders at a local, regional, national and international level. When doing so, we apply the Nestl\u00e9 Corporate Business Principles of \u201ctransparent interaction and communication\u201d to foster collaboration, knowledge sharing, open discussion and deep dialogue.\n\nOur stakeholder universe is large and varied and we engage with our stakeholders in many different ways. However, each project, launch, collaboration, campaign and event has a common purpose: to help advance regenerative food systems at scale.\n\nThroughout the year, we also consult regularly with our CSV Council, an external advisory council established in 2009 and formed of a group of experts from a broad range of fields, from corporate responsibility, strategy and sustainability to nutrition, water and rural development. The Council has an advisory role. In 2022, topics discussed included implementation of the Nestl\u00e9 packaging vision and commitments, progress on our Net Zero Roadmap and regenerative agriculture commitments, the roll out of our income accelerator program and our commitment to provide transparency on the nutritional value of the Nestl\u00e9 portfolio. The Council also discussed how to develop our sustainability reporting in light of incoming regulatory requirements.\n\nIn 2022, we were pleased to be ranked first among 25 food and beverage companies benchmarked in the ATN\u2019s Spotlight on Lobbying scorecard, released in December 2022.

Today, improving access to healthier foods, as well as providing relief to people and communities during disasters, helps support what we do. In 2022, we donated more than CHF 120 million, and most of our contributions were related to food access.\n\nIn Ukraine, since the invasion, our focus has been on keeping our employees and their families safe, maintaining our operations wherever possible, as well as supporting the people of Ukraine. In 2022, Nestl\u00e9 committed a CHF 40 million investment for a new production facility and more than CHF 14 million in contributions to the people of Ukraine, together with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. We have provided more than 4200 tonnes of food donations through various local and international partner organizations. With the UkraineNest Foundation, we organized an employee fundraising to restore the homes of our colleagues in the country.\n\nIn June 2022, Nestl\u00e9 entered a global partnership with World Central Kitchen, a non-profit organization that specializes in providing meals for people who have been affected by catastrophic events. Nestl\u00e9 has supported World Central Kitchen in an initial one-year agreement and with a CHF 1 million donation to its Climate Disaster Fund. During the year, we engaged with World Central Kitchen to support various communities stricken by extreme weather events related to the climate crisis, including those affected by floods in Pakistan, as well hurricanes Fiona and Ian in Puerto Rico and the United States.\n\nOur offices and 344 factories around the world support their local communities in many ways, including through job creation and economic growth. They also organize charitable activities, including support for events in and around Vevey, Switzerland, home to our headquarters.\nOn the road to net zero\n\nClimate change is already here. Urgent action is needed. At Nestl\u00e9, we have put peak carbon behind us and are driving down emissions in our operations and supply chain.\n\nProgress on our roadmap to 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 and 50% reduction by 2030 and net zero by 2050\n\n2018 baseline (million tonnes of CO\u2082e)\n\n- Peak carbon\n- 94.3% 2018 baseline\n- 99.7% Business-as-usual scenario\n- 93.3% Actual emissions\n\n6.4 Million tonnes of CO\u2082e reductions compared with business-as-usual scenario\n\n- 68% Ingredient sourcing\n- 28% Manufacturing\n- 4% Packaging\n\nKey initiatives delivering GHG emissions reductions in 2022\n\nTotal Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions (million tonnes of CO\u2082e)\n\n- Scope 1 (emitted directly)\n- Scope 2 (emitted indirectly market-based)\n- Scope 3 (in scope for Net Zero Roadmap)\n- Scope 3 (not in scope for Net Zero Roadmap)\n\n2018 baseline: In scope for Net Zero Roadmap\n\n- 121.52* 120.62* 112.90\n- 1.63 1.44 0.76\n\nSDG CONTRIBUTIONS\n\n- 7 Clean Energy\n- 11 Sustainable Cities\n- 12 Responsible Consumption and Production\n- 14 Life below Water\n- 15 Life on Land\n\n6.4 Million tonnes of CO\u2082e reductions compared with business-as-usual scenario\n\n- 53.5% in 2020\n- 63.7% in 2021\n- 78.4% in 2022\n\n* Restated due to acquisitions, divestures, emissions factor restatements and adjusted scope.\nBackground\nClimate change is no longer a future concern. It is already here. In 2022, much of the northern hemisphere experienced extreme heat, drought and wildfires. Hurricanes battered North America and the Caribbean. Devastating flooding hit Nigeria and Pakistan and Asia was affected by heavy typhoons. Meanwhile, data from NASA shows that global temperatures have increased by up to 1.01\u00b0C since pre-industrial times. What is less well known perhaps \u2013 sea levels are over 10cm higher than in 1993, the ocean is more than three times as hot as it was in 1980 and arctic sea ice has shrunk by an average of 12.6% every decade since 1979.\n\nFood system topics such as land-use change, agricultural production, packaging and waste management are linked to up to one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, the effects of climate change have already begun to impact food systems. Extreme weather patterns are affecting growing seasons and making crop yields less predictable, while increases in extreme weather such as droughts and floods are threatening food security.\n\nWe must continue to act to help avoid the worst potential climate scenarios and protect vulnerable communities, including those whose livelihoods depend on agriculture.\n\nApproach\nIn 2020, we launched our Net Zero Roadmap, a Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)-aligned plan to reduce Nestl\u00e9\u2019s emissions. It has enabled us to put peak carbon emissions behind us and make progress toward our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets for 2025 (20% reduction) and 2030 (50% reduction).\n\nBecause climate intersects every part of our company, it forms one of the five workstreams of our ESG Strategy and Deployment Unit.\n\nA detailed analysis of our GHG emissions, carried out when setting our 2018 baseline, showed that 85% of our footprint was made up of Scope 3 emissions from activities in our supply chain such as farming and land use, and just 5% was Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our own operations. Dairy and livestock ingredients are our largest single source of emissions \u2013 dairy alone accounts for one-third of our total emissions.\n\nTo make progress toward our net zero commitment, we focus primarily on our upstream supply chain including our dairy and livestock sourcing. We have developed two main strategic approaches upstream that will help tackle our\n\nScope 3 emissions: Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Forest Positive strategy and Regenerative Agriculture Framework\n\nAlongside the focus on Scope 3, we are working to systematically reduce emissions in Scopes 1 and 2, by reducing the carbon footprint of our factories and fleet cars.\n\nInnovation to tackle farm emissions\nWhen dairy cows digest their feed they produce methane, which has a far greater global warming potential than CO\u2082. So-called \u201centeric fermentation\u201d is the largest source of emissions in fresh milk production, followed by feed production and manure.\n\nWorking with external partners, we are exploring the use of novel feed supplements, wearable devices, improved nutrition and immunological approaches that decrease enteric methane production, but do not negatively impact the yield of nutritious and safe milk or animal welfare and health. For example, in the United States, we are facilitating research to assess the efficacy and the human, animal and environmental health and safety aspects of a seaweed-based feed supplement, which has the potential to reduce enteric methane emissions significantly.\n\nIn parallel, we are looking at scientific approaches to reduce emissions related to manure management and feed production. We test and validate these innovative technologies in our research farm network prior to rolling them out in our supply chains. For example, in the United States, we are rolling out vermicomposting, which uses worms to naturally degrade manure with lower methane production \u2013 replacing the need to capture and store the gas. The worms also remove up to 99% of wastewater contaminants and generate castings that can be used as fertilizer to improve soil health. This practice targets one of the largest sources of emissions on many dairy farms.\n\nHow shifts in sourcing can reduce our carbon footprint.\n\nAround the world farmers are at different stages of the transition toward regenerative agriculture practices. One way we can reduce our footprint is by switching more volumes to suppliers, cooperatives and farmers in countries of origin that already have regenerative agriculture practices in place \u2013 while helping farmers in other regions to make the shift as well, supporting a just transition.\n\nThe bulk of our carbon footprint is already present when we purchase raw materials such as dairy, coffee, cocoa, palm oil and meat. Packaging and shipping are much less significant \u2013 only a fraction of the carbon footprint compared with how the raw material is produced. This means selecting ingredients produced using climate-smart practices can make a significant difference, even if they are shipped from further away.\n\nA reward mechanism\nLet\u2019s take coffee beans as a hypothetical example. Imagine that well-established farmers in country A are already practicing agroforestry, such as intercropping trees for timber with coffee trees and employing smart irrigation techniques. Meanwhile, farmers in country B have focused on amplifying monoculture-intensive coffee production but have not yet embraced sustainable measures.\n\nIf the carbon data show that a unit of coffee from country A has a carbon footprint of 3kg, while the same amount from country B has a footprint of 5kg, then by shifting bigger volumes to country A, we can notably reduce our carbon footprint.\n\nThis allows us to recognize and reward the more progressive farmers that have already made the necessary transition. At the same time, we recognize the huge challenge farmers in country B face and continue to provide technical and financial support to bring their methods up to where our industry needs them to be. It\u2019s a two-fold approach \u2013 a fair reward mechanism and a just transition \u2013 that underpins how much volume we shift and to where.\n\nHarder in practice\nWhile that sounds simple in theory, in practice it\u2019s not straightforward. Our decisions need to be backed up by accurate emissions data mapped at farm level. And while we already collect and validate this with our suppliers for dairy, cocoa, coffee and palm oil, there\u2019s still work to do.\n\nAdditionally, in many places, we have pre-agreed volume commitments upon which people\u2019s livelihoods depend. Clearly, economic viability and security of supply still factor in purchasing decisions. And let\u2019s not forget taste \u2013 different regions often grow different varieties of a crop that can taste slightly different and impact recipes.\n\nDespite these challenges, shifting sourcing in this way is already underway, as exemplified by the total volume of our commodities now coming from assessed deforestation-free verified origins or certified as sustainably produced. This accounts for 25% of the Scope 3 emissions saved through implementation of our Net Zero Roadmap.\n\nFor more information on climate-related risks and opportunities, see our Climate Risk and Impact report.\n\nSourcing from locations already implementing practices such as agroforestry can reduce our carbon footprint.\nIn 2022, our GHG emissions remained decoupled from business growth, as we again achieved higher revenues and lower absolute emissions. Our total absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions reduced from 120.6 million* in 2021 to 112.9 million in 2022.\n\nAs per our SBTi approved roadmap, our in-scope emissions have now reduced by 6.4 million tonnes to 93.3 million tonnes compared with a projected business-as-usual scenario of 99.7 million tonnes. In addition, actual emissions of 93.3 million tonnes have fallen below our 2018 baseline of 94.3 million tonnes for the first time since introducing our Net Zero Roadmap, despite revenue growth over the same four-year period. Emissions reductions are the result of a wide range of projects in our agricultural supply chains, as well as in our factories. All reductions associated with a project meet the accounting principles set out in the GHG Protocol Corporate and Project standards.\n\nWe are proud of our progress but know there is more to do to reduce our absolute emissions on our way to net zero by 2050 at the latest. We are still adapting our approach in response to what we learn. Many of our emissions reduction projects will take time to implement but we remain confident they will yield results to keep us on track.\n\nIn addition to these emissions reduction projects, we secured 4.3 million tonnes of CO\u2082e removals by implementing nature-based solutions that take CO\u2082e from the atmosphere into carbon stores. Our net zero commitment does not rely on offsetting. These removals take place within our supply chains and the landscapes where we source our raw materials, and help restore forests, wetlands and peatlands, or improve land management. Secured removals are the total carbon that will be captured and stored (e.g. in trees or soils) over the 20- or 30-year lifetime of a project. Every year, we will track the actual carbon removal and storage across our value chain in the reporting period (known as delivered removals or ex-post carbon accounting). These removals will be reported as progress in line with the SBTi FLAG guidance (released November 2022).\n\n### Scope 1 and 2 emissions\n\nAll of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions are being addressed as part of our Net Zero Roadmap, and our actions contribute to our absolute emissions reductions.\n\nWe continued to make progress toward our commitment to source 100% renewable electricity across our sites globally by 2025, reaching 78.4% renewable electricity sourced in our manufacturing sites in 2022 (2021: 63.7%). Our factories in Australia, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, South Africa, Thailand and Vietnam increased their purchases of renewable electricity this year. In Europe, 93% of our factories were running on 100% renewable electricity. The majority of the renewable electricity we use is generated offshore by third-party suppliers. In addition to the 78.4% of renewable electricity sourced, we currently have onsite generation at nine factories in Europe and the Middle East, and this may expand in the future.\n\nIn North America, Nestl\u00e9 completed its second large-scale solar energy farm investment. Combined, the solar energy farms will represent nearly 50% of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s electricity in the United States, thereby halving its Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nSome factories are also switching to renewable sources of thermal energy. In Indonesia, one factory has switched from fossil fuels to locally supplied rice-husk-based biofuel. A second factory is expected to complete the switch in 2023. We have introduced industrial heat pumps replacing the use of fossil fuels in La Penilla, Spain, saving 2000 tonnes of CO\u2082e per year, and in Konolfingen and Orbe in Switzerland, saving 1000 tonnes of CO\u2082e per year. Our Nestl\u00e9 Waters facility in Henniez, Switzerland, works with a third-party biogas plant, which collects manure, Nespresso coffee grounds (from capsule recycling) and other locally produced industrial organic waste to convert into renewable energy. The electricity produced is injected into the Swiss grid, while part of the heat is valorized at the Henniez factory. The bottling site used 74% of renewable energy in 2022. A liquid by-product of the process serves as a highly efficient and odorless organic fertilizer and is recovered and used by the contributing farmers.\n\nAs part of our Net Zero Roadmap, we committed to switching our global car fleet to lower emissions options by 2022. At the end of the year, 41% of our fleet had switched to lower-emissions options. We compensated emissions from the remaining 59% that we could not switch, mainly as a result of a lack of available vehicles and infrastructure in some markets. We will seek to increase the proportion of lower-emission vehicles in our fleet as availability and infrastructure improves.\n\nAs part of our ongoing Green Fleet Project, the shift to electric, biofuel, hybrid or plug-in hybrid vehicles continued in 2022, with our Green Fleet increasing from 27.2% in 2021 to 41.0% of our entire corporate fleet. Meanwhile, we rolled out electric trucks in Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, along with hydrogen trucks in Switzerland.\n\n### Energy consumption\n\n| Energy consumption | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|--------------------|------|------|------|\n| Energy consumption (Gigajoules) | 81,585,558 | 83,773,470 | 85,131,120 |\n| Energy consumed that is renewable energy (%) | 23.9 | 25.3 | 33.6 |\n| Energy consumed that was supplied from grid-electricity (%) | 12.6 | 10.2 | 6.0 |\n\n### 41.0% Global fleet switched to lower-emission options (27.2% in 2021, 17.6% in 2020)\n\n### Scope 3 emissions\n\nIn line with SBTi guidance, our total reported Scope 3 emissions include some categories that are not currently covered by our SBTi-aligned GHG emissions reduction target. These emissions accounted for less than 33% of Scope 3 emissions in the 2018 baseline. These include consumer use of sold products, purchased services, leased assets, capital goods and investments. As a result, our total Scope 3 emissions reported for 2022 (108.9 million tonnes) are higher than the Scope 3 emissions that fall within our SBTi-aligned target (89.3 million tonnes).\n\nDairy ingredients are our single largest source of Scope 3 emissions. We are working with leading universities and NGOs to support net zero efforts in dairy farming around the world (see the Making Swiss dairy a climate star case study). This includes investing in at least 25 pilot farms in 15 countries to test scalable, low-carbon and regenerative agriculture practices that may help those farms achieve net zero GHG emissions.\n\nCurrently, we have one pilot farm in South Africa that aims to achieve net zero in the near future, and another in the United States aiming for net zero by 2025. Twenty-three other pilot farms are investigating exciting possibilities to support net zero efforts. In Spain, we are engaging with more than 200 dairy farmers to implement emission reduction practices, which have aimed at reducing their footprint by 40% by 2026. In the UK, since 2015 we have worked with more than 70 farmers to plant more than 42 kilometers of hedgerows and protected more than 40 kilometers of rivers and streams.\n\n* Restated due to acquisitions, divestures, emission factor restatements and adjusted scope.\nWe use the Cool Farm Tool \u2013 an external online GHG, water and biodiversity calculator to help companies calculate the environmental footprint of their agricultural raw materials \u2013 for key ingredients including dairy. The tool, already being used to capture primary data in Brazil and Colombia, has been rolled out to seven new origins.\n\nWe also continued our work to lower carbon emissions associated with our logistics:\n\n- Nestl\u00e9 is investing over CHF 100 million by 2030 in low-carbon logistics for three international water brands: Acqua Panna, Perrier and S. Pellegrino.\n- In France, Nestl\u00e9 Waters launched new rail routes for Perrier, saving an estimated 11 400 tonnes of CO\u2082 per year by the end of 2022. The business is also working with partners to roll out a hydrogen-powered train route in France by 2025. This route will help reduce CO\u2082 by an estimated 10 000 tonnes per year \u2013 a reduction of 89% of its current emissions.\n- Nestl\u00e9 UK & Ireland designed, built and tested new curtain-sided rail containers with several partners. The containers have a raisable roof and can transport double-stacked palletised products by rail. According to Network Rail, each freight train takes up to 76 heavy goods vehicles off the roads.\n- Together with its logistics and fuel suppliers, Nestl\u00e9 Waters is scaling up the use of biofuels, including bio-LNG (liquefied natural gas made from processed organic waste) in trucks and other types of biofuels in ocean freight logistics to North America. Nestl\u00e9 UK & Ireland switched 73% of its owned fleet of trucks from diesel to bio-LNG. Partners of Nestl\u00e9 Waters in Italy and Germany have also started incorporating this technology in their logistic operations.\n- In Germany, work on a new distribution center is under way. The aim is for the center to achieve platinum certification from the German Sustainable Building Council. The plan is to reduce both our freight mileage and CO\u2082 footprint from logistics by around 30% per year.\n\nProduct portfolio and packaging\n\nOur recipe decisions for new and established products are based on GHG emissions-reducing potential as well as nutrition, taste and cost. In 2022, Garden Gourmet received the Solar Impulse Efficient Solution Label, marking it as a solution that is good for people, the environment and business.\n\nThe Nestl\u00e9 Professional Future Cup initiative launched a customer-facing lifecycle assessment tool that helps our sales reps improve transparency to customers, allowing them to make more informed sustainable purchasing choices.\n\nIn China, we are collaborating with several large retailers. For example, in a collaboration with Alibaba and 18 other consumer goods companies, Nestl\u00e9 is promoting the Decarbonization-Friendly Actions program in an effort to increase carbon reduction actions across the industry. Nestl\u00e9 is one of the most active companies by providing 26 lower-carbon products in the food and beverage category on the Alibaba platform.\n\nIn Poland, Nestl\u00e9 engaged and educated consumers on food waste by focusing a television commercial of one of the biggest culinary brands in the country \u2013 Winiary.\n\nThe development of environmental footprint labeling schemes in Europe gained significant momentum in 2022. Nestl\u00e9 is closely following the main initiatives to help push for a harmonized European system. Our actions include:\n\n- France: pilot testing some Nestl\u00e9 products against Eco-Score and Planet-Score\n- Belgium: closely monitoring the roll out of Eco-Score on products for retailer Colruyt\n- UK: a nine-month R&D partnership with Foundation Earth has helped develop a UK methodology for measuring carbon, water usage, eutrophication and biodiversity loss from farm to shelf for 12 Nestl\u00e9 products. An EU Product Environmental Footprint methodology (covering farm to fork) is underway.\n\nFood loss and waste\n\nFood loss and waste are unacceptable, though difficult to tackle in practice. They accounted for around 670 000 tonnes of CO\u2082e in our 2018 baseline study. While this is a very low proportion of our total emissions, we aim to reduce food loss and waste at every stage of our value chain.\n\nIn 2022, we joined an industry-wide pledge in partnership with the Swiss authorities to halve food loss and waste by 2030. We also became a Waste Warrior Brand to help prevent food loss and waste at a consumer level. In the UK, together with major UK supermarkets and organizations, we signed similar world-leading government pledges to help halve food waste by 2030. We make use of agricultural side streams (e.g. in Nea\u010daf\u00e9 Nativ Cascara), recover food waste in factories to use as biofuel and work with farmers and consumers to minimize waste.\n\nTotal weight of waste generated in Nestl\u00e9 factories in 2022 and a breakdown of this total by composition of the waste (metric tonnes)\n\n| Waste composition | Hazardous waste generated | Non-Hazardous waste generated | Total |\n|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|-------|\n| Biomass           | 839                       | 1 973                         | 2 812 |\n| Mixed waste       | 33 067                    | 505 422                       | 538 489|\n| Total             | 33 906                    | 507 331                       | 541 237|\n\nAdvocacy\n\nThroughout 2022, we continued to advocate for ambitious government policies and private sector leadership to encourage all sectors to move quickly toward rapid and sustained emissions reductions. Examples include:\n\n- Working with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development on corporate climate action and furthering discussions around issues such as nature and plastics at Climate Week NYC 2022.\n- Advocating for the inclusion of food systems at COP27, alongside a range of stakeholders and other companies. We hosted discussions in Sharm El Sheikh on topics such as ensuring a just transition in food and agriculture and encouraging a new generation of farmers into the profession.\n- Publicly supporting the Business for Nature campaign for mandatory disclosure of impacts and dependencies on biodiversity by large companies and financial institutions at the CBD COP15 negotiations in Montreal in December.\n\nWe are an active member of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures working group, which is aimed at advancing the collective understanding of how to report on double-materiality risks and dependencies related to the natural environment. This complements our membership of the Corporate Engagement Program run by the Science Based Targets Network.\n\nWe have taken steps to enhance transparency on our advocacy and lobbying activities, such as publishing our 2022 Climate Advocacy Report.\nOutlook\nWe will continue working hard to reduce GHG emissions across our operations and value chain. We aim to accelerate Scope 3 emissions reductions by focusing on actions at the farm level. Actions will include the scaling up of regenerative agriculture practices and the implementation of our Forest Positive strategy.\n\nHelping farmers in higher-carbon origins to improve their practices will be a priority as we begin sourcing higher volumes from origins with lower-carbon footprints. Additionally, we will seek further opportunities to reduce emissions from our vehicle fleet and third-party logistics, and to source more renewable electricity in our operations.\n\nWe will continue our wide-ranging engagement work with governments and international organizations, particularly on reducing deforestation risk and protecting nature. One of our advocacy objectives for 2023 is to encourage the placement of regenerative food systems at the heart of national climate plans and for this to be a central focus for COP28 negotiators in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nA partnership to lower emissions in Switzerland.\n\nDairy and livestock are the single largest source of Nestl\u00e9 emissions; reducing them is essential for achieving our overall climate ambitions.\n\nAround the world, we are seeking ways to make a difference in each local context.

Launched in June 2021, our Forest Positive strategy builds on a decade of work to end deforestation in our supply chains. It recognizes the need to collectively move from managing risk to genuinely focusing on how we can achieve a positive impact in the critical landscapes that underpin the food systems in which we are important actors. An external advisory council of independent experts advises us on the implementation of our strategy.\n\nOur approach has three pillars:\n\nDeforestation-free supply chains\nIn 2010, Nestl\u00e9 committed to achieving and maintaining deforestation-free primary supply chains. We aimed to achieve this:\n- By 2022 for meat, palm oil, pulp and paper, soy and sugar primary supply chains\n- By 2025 for coffee and cocoa\n\nOur Responsible Sourcing Standard is the tool that we use to manage this. Our objective is to ensure that the raw materials we buy do not originate from:\n- Areas converted from High Carbon Stock forests\n- Areas converted from natural ecosystems such as wetlands or savannas\n- Conversion of peatlands of any depth, except where farming practices protect peat\n- International Union for Conservation of Nature protected areas categories I-IV\n- UNESCO World Heritage Sites and wetlands on the Ramsar List\n\nWe map our supply chains to know where the raw materials that we buy come from. In at-risk origins, we take steps to assess that our purchases are not contributing to deforestation or the conversion of natural habitats. The techniques we use include satellite mapping and monitoring, on-the-ground assessments and certification.\n\nLong-term forest conservation and restoration\nOur Global Reforestation Program (GRP) is aimed at helping to conserve and restore land and natural ecosystems in our supply chain and sourcing landscapes, while respecting the rights of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities and promoting sustainable livelihoods. The selected projects are designed to have positive long-term impacts on people, nature and the climate. We aim to grow 200 million trees by 2030.\n\nSustainable landscapes\nForest conservation and restoration is about much more than keeping trees standing and natural ecosystems intact. It is about reshaping incentives and how people behave to help protect the forests for the long term. We are engaging with key partners and Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities at a landscape level to identify projects that can have a positive impact at a scale we could not achieve alone. Our actions include rewarding suppliers for practices that keep trees standing, helping to regenerate the land and respecting human rights. Our aim is to support 15 sustainable landscape initiatives by 2023.\n\nBackground\nForests absorb approximately 2.6 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide every year. This is the equivalent to one third of the CO2 released from burning fossil fuels. As home to 1.6 billion people.\n\nAs the global population grows, and demand for food along with it, remaining forests and other natural ecosystems are at risk of being converted into farmland. Forests are also at increased risk of wildfires.\n\nEfforts are being made to protect the forestland that remains. Provisionally agreed legislative requirements on deforestation-free products, updated by the European Commission in 2022, seek to increase the list of commodities that must prove their deforestation-free status, with increased protections for indigenous rights.\n\nAt Nestl\u00e9, we believe that a forest positive future depends on a broad approach that includes assessing deforestation risks, conserving and restoring forests, respecting community and land rights, and investing in sustainable production landscapes. We cannot achieve our net zero targets without a forest positive approach.\n\nGlobal Reforestation Program\nOur Global Reforestation Program aims to grow 200 million trees by 2030 in our sourcing landscapes to create a positive long-term impact on people, nature and the climate. Projects will help restore natural forest landscapes, introduce agroforestry systems for suitable crops and support other natural ecosystem restoration activities.\n\nPhase 1: Steps of initial investigation\n- Map Nestl\u00e9\u2019s sourcing locations\n- Conduct investigation and scoping\n- Identify project opportunities in a country or region\n- Meeting project criteria\n- Conduct due-diligence screening for carbon-claims challenges and opportunities related to local context\n\nPhase 2: Elements assessed in pre-feasibility study\n- Eligible locations\n- Scale of reforestation potential\n- Carbon sequestration potential\n- Indicative project costs\n- Risks\n- Environmental and social co-benefit opportunities\n- Applicable carbon accounting methodologies\n\nPhase 3: Process to activate a project\n- Develop project design document and monitoring plan, to include:\n  - Detailed project plan\n  - Timelines\n  - Costs\n  - Carbon calculations\n  - Sign contract and scope of work\n  - Allocate funding\n  - Activate partners and local partnerships\n\nPhase 4: Actions to implement and monitor\n- Grow seedlings in nurseries\n- Plant trees\n- Conduct short- and long-term monitoring of trees planted, carbon sequestered and other co-benefit outcomes\n\nPhase 5: Project lifetime monitoring\n- Conduct long-term monitoring of trees planted, carbon sequestered and other co-benefits\n\nTable of contents\nCreating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2022\nA marketplace for nature-based solutions\n\nLandscape Enterprise Networks \u2013 the LENs program \u2013 is a methodology for buying and selling nature-based solutions that reduce risk to businesses, while improving the health of a landscape.\n\nLENs began as an extension of sustainable risk management in general (i.e. how does soil loss, biodiversity, deforestation and human rights affect Nestl\u00e9\u2019s business), with a specific focus on the dairy farming landscape of a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Cumbria, north west England. Here, all the milk that is critical to the landscapes that we, our business partners and our communities depend on.\n\nBut these risks weren\u2019t unique to Nestl\u00e9. There were other sectors with similar interests such as water utility companies and local government, as well as other companies connected to agriculture. We realized that while different businesses had different needs from the landscape, those needs could be delivered by similar sets of land management solutions. These businesses could therefore co-invest and divide the costs between them \u2013 increasing commercial efficiency dramatically. This quickly realized that if we understood the landscape risks that matter most to Nestl\u00e9, we could work out a clear business case for them to invest in and take care of that landscape.\n\nThe success of the program means that LENs will continue to scale up, both in the UK and globally. Projects are already underway in Italy, Hungary and Poland. We are excited by the potential of the model for securing the future of the landscapes that we, our business partners and our communities depend on.\n\nProof of concept\nFrom a single project in Cumbria, LENs expanded as we put this principle into practice through multiple initiatives across the UK and Europe. For example, LENs was successfully established in the East of England, an important area for sourcing wheat for cereals and pet food, in 2021. Here, Nestl\u00e9 Purina PetCare and Nestl\u00e9 Cereal Partners UK are working with water companies and local authorities, together funding over 62 farmers and land managers to introduce nature-based measures across more than 10,000 hectares of land.\n\nLENs makes this possible by creating a place for buying and selling nature-based solutions. LENs acts as a neutral broker for transactions between investors and groups of land managers, who can implement actions on the ground. Essentially, we built a \u2018trading community\u2019.\n\nTrades also represent a profit-making opportunity for land managers and farmers, who can now sell nature-based solutions in addition to their crops. Everything is local and organized within the regional economy so that outcomes make sense for the communities and ecosystems we operate in.\n\nPopular measures in the east of England LENs included planting cover crops, which are intended to protect water quality and reduce soil erosion; reducing cultivation to improve soil health, and planting hedgerows. It\u2019s a win-win for everyone: food and pet food are produced with less negative impact, while helping to halt the decline in biodiversity and regenerate the areas we live in and enjoy.\n\nThe success of the program means that LENs will continue to scale up, both in the UK and globally. Projects are already underway in Italy, Hungary and Poland. We are excited by the potential of the model for securing the future of the landscapes that we, our business partners and our communities depend on.\n\n62 Farmers and land managers funded to introduce nature-based measures in the east of England pilot\n\n>10,000 Hectares of land covered in the east of England pilot\n\nPerformance\nThe publication of our Human Rights Salient Issue Action Plan on Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities\u2019 Land Rights in Q1 2023 is a major milestone. Indigenous rights are an important consideration in all three pillars of our Forest Positive strategy and this action plan helps reinforce our Forest Positive activities.\n\nDeforestation-free supply chains\nBy the end of 2022, 99.1% of our primary supply chains for meat, palm oil, pulp and paper, soy and sugar were assessed as deforestation-free. Our palm oil supply chain presents the greatest opportunity to improve, with 95.6% assessed as deforestation-free.\n\nFrom experience, we know that the last percentage points are the hardest to reach, due to the volume sourced from thousands of smallholders who require customized technical assistance at a local level.\n\nLong-term forest conservation and restoration in our supply chains\nIn 2022, as part of our ongoing Global Reforestation Program (GRP), we began work to plant 10 million trees in Australia by 2025 (see the Reforestation in Australia case study) as well as launching new projects in China, Ghana and Thailand leading up to 12.4 million trees. Overall, we secured 3.1 million tonnes of CO\u2082e removals through nature-based solutions in 2022. Secured removals are from projects that were contracted in 2022 but had not necessarily been implemented by the end of the year.\n\nIn Colombia, a GRP project delivered more than 310,000 trees. Ultimately, it aims to plant 7.5 million trees in and around farmers\u2019 coffee fields.\n\nIn Nicaragua, an ongoing GRP project from 2021 (within the Nescaf\u00e9 and dairy supply chains) reached its 2022 goal of planting one million trees, as part of a 20-year project to plant 8.6 million trees in total. The project has an estimated carbon capture potential of 1.9 million tonnes of CO\u2082e over 20 years. It is expected to improve biodiversity and forest connectivity, as well as protecting water sheds and creating additional income for participating farmers.\n\nSimilarly, an ongoing GRP project in Honduras (within the Nescaf\u00e9 supply chain) reached over 500,000 trees planted by the end of the year. This is part of a 20-year project, aimed at planting 5 million trees over the course of the first six years. The trees will be used as shade trees on coffee farms and for restoring forests in protected areas.\n\nThrough the Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan, we distributed 1.47 million tonnes of CO\u2082e secured over a 20-year period through tree-planting projects initiated (9.3m in 2021)\nSustainable landscapes\nIn line with our ambition to support 15 sustainable landscape initiatives by 2023, we now have active landscape projects in Brazil, Chile, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru and Russia.\n\nIn 2022, our palm oil team mapped sourcing regions with the greatest land rights risks against volumes of palm oil sourced from those regions. This will improve our understanding of land rights risks. The results are being used to develop a strategy for identifying landscape-level projects that Nestl\u00e9 can support and/or participate in, and can be duplicated for other raw materials.\n\nIn C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan has been working in collaboration with the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire Ministry of Water and Forest and Earthworm Foundation to help protect and restore the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire Forest Positive Coalition. Activities include working with farmers and supporting patrols of the forest to remove illegal cocoa plantations within the natural reserve.\n\nWork has also been undertaken in the wildlife corridors of Boki and Bossemati forests near the Ghanaian border. On a smaller scale, a 2021 pilot project working with the community of Toa Z\u00e9o village to protect around 30 hectares of local and sacred forestland was so successful that in 2022, the model was replicated in other villages. We believe the model of working at a small scale has the potential to be rolled out to other communities in the country, and collectively to make a large impact.\n\nOutlook\nWe remain focused on achieving our deforestation-free commitment, including progressing toward having our cocoa and coffee supply chains assessed as deforestation-free by 2025.\n\nWe will also begin to operationalize our Salient Issue Action Plan on Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities\u2019 land rights, which was published in Q1 2023.\n\nWe will continue to collaborate and promote best practices through external initiatives including the Consumer Goods Forum Positive Coalition, the Cocoa and Forest Initiative and the Tropical Forest Alliance. We will also continue to advocate for greater transparency and more collective action from companies, governments and civil society.\n\nReforestation in Australia\nNestl\u00e9 has made the ambitious pledge to plant 10 million trees in Australia by 2025.\n\nThe project is part of the Nestl\u00e9 Global Reforestation Program, which aims to plant and grow 200 million trees globally by 2030 in the regions we source from, helping to secure our path to net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nIn Australia, the trees will be planted in locations linked to agricultural areas where Nestl\u00e9 sources raw materials. Working hand in hand with local landholders and communities, the trees will help conserve local biodiversity, improve water quality and restore degraded soils.\n\nUnique challenge\nWith over 132 million hectares of unique and varied native forests, Australia has the seventh largest forest area in the world, making up 3% of the world\u2019s forests. However, Australia is also highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, having already experienced a rise in average temperatures and long-term changes in rainfall, as well as more intense and damaging storms, longer fire seasons and more extreme weather.\n\nThe 10 million trees \u2013 a mix of native plant species \u2013 will sequester an estimated 2.1 million tonnes of CO2e over a 25-year carbon crediting period. In fact, averaged over the project lifetime, this is equivalent to fuel emissions from more than 25,000 cars each year, according to Australian government numbers. The project kicked off at the tail end of the 2022 planting season, with over 200,000 trees planted across almost 100 hectares in New South Wales and Victoria.\n\nAround 65 different species were selected, including the Eucalyptus Strzelecki, an indigenous plant that is nationally vulnerable to extinction, the Allocasuarina littoralis, a key food source for the Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoo and the Leptospermum lanigerus, commonly known as the \u201cWoolly Tea-tree\u201d, a species that attracts pollinators.\n\nRestoring diverse landscapes\nTo ensure the project is correctly managed and monitored, Nestl\u00e9 is partnering with One Tree Planted, Greening Australia and Canopy. These organizations are committed to restoring Australia\u2019s diverse landscapes and protecting biodiversity in ways that benefit communities, economies and nature. They will ensure that the trees are monitored across 28 years as they mature, delivering long-term environmental and economic benefits.\n\n\u201cOur partnership with Greening Australia and One Tree Planted is designed so that the 10 million trees we plant in Australia will be maintained and cared for until they reach maturity, delivering tangible long-term environmental and economic benefits.\u201d\n\nSandra Mart\u00ednez\nCEO, Nestl\u00e9 Oceania\n\nTable of contents\nCreating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2022 18\nRegenerative agriculture has the potential to play a critical role in improving soil health, sequestering carbon, supporting food security, restoring water cycles and biodiversity. This is why we are investing in it.\n\nBackground\nThe 20th century saw extraordinary population and economic growth, enabled by an evolution in agriculture. This delivered affordable food to many, but also contributed to an over-exploitation of natural resources and, at times, led to negative social impacts.\n\nWe need an agricultural system that sustains and improves the use of resources. Climate and nature-smart agriculture \u2013 or regenerative agriculture \u2013 will increasingly form the basis for success in achieving this.\n\nThe food systems of which we are a part have delivered great benefits to the world and withstood great shocks \u2013 not least in recent years. But the multiple threats of climate change, unprecedented biodiversity loss, social inequality and risks to human rights, to name but a few, demand a fresh approach.\n\nCurrently, there is no detailed, standard definition of regenerative agriculture \u2013 although many organizations are working on one. However, the general principles and practices of regenerative agriculture are aimed at improving soil health and fertility, protecting water resources and safeguarding biodiversity.\n\nRestoring soil health can also help capture increased levels of carbon in soils and plant biomass. Healthier soils are more resilient to the impacts of climate change and may increase yields, helping to improve farmers\u2019 livelihoods in the long term.\n\nFor Nestl\u00e9, sourcing 20% of our key ingredients from regenerative agriculture methods by 2025 and 50% by 2030 will be important for us to achieve the goals in our Net Zero Roadmap.\nApproach\n\nWe aim to source 20% of our key ingredients through regenerative agriculture methods by 2025 (and 50% by 2030). In 2022, we launched the Nestl\u00e9 Agriculture Framework to better explain our approach to regenerative agriculture. It defines the three key resources of any agricultural system: soil, water, and biodiversity as the focus of collective restoration efforts.\n\nThe framework includes key concepts from conservation agriculture, sustainable intensification, climate-smart farming, agroecology, low-input farming, precision farming and others to create an approach that actively helps improve and restore natural resources.\n\nFarmers are at the center of our model. They are the ones managing resources and making decisions on practices depending on their specific individual circumstances. Where introducing regenerative agriculture practices generates initial risks or costs for smallholder farmers, we may provide technical, collaborative or financial assistance to support a just transition.\n\nNestl\u00e9 employs more than 700 sourcing specialists and more than 5500 staff to help us purchase fresh ingredients around the world. Our teams work with farmers to manage resources and identify the best agricultural practices for each local context.\n\nAs part of our approach, we encourage industry alignment on common frameworks and metrics for regenerative agriculture. Notably, we are members of the SAI Platform, which is one of several bodies working toward a common frameworks and metrics for regenerative agriculture. Notably, we are members of the SAI Platform, on which we are working to develop a framework to better explain our approach to regenerative agriculture.\n\nNestl\u00e9\u2019s regenerative agriculture model\n\n- Diverse cropping systems and livestock integration*\n- Collective and landscape actions\n- Soil health\n- Biodiversity\n- Water security and quality\n\n* Whenever possible and relevant.\n\nWhy companies need to support a just transition.\n\nGlobal trade can play a powerful role in alleviating poverty. Companies that source raw materials from smallholder farmers have an opportunity \u2013 and an obligation \u2013 to ensure that their trading terms and sustainability programs enable farmers to afford a decent standard of living, or a \u201cliving income.\u201d\n\nWhen we talk about living income, we\u2019re talking about more than farmer livelihoods. Farmers who can afford a decent standard of living are better able to invest in regenerative agriculture and protect the environment. This in turn provides a more sustainable future for farming and contributes to a healthier planet. The social and the environmental elements are intrinsically linked \u2013 to make progress in one, you must support both.\n\nUltimately, a company\u2019s role is to provide an enabling environment in which farming households can thrive. This is with the understanding that farming households are independent business people who make their own decisions and engage in their own livelihood strategies.\n\nIn our work with leading companies and brands such as Nescaf\u00e9, we\u2019ve come to understand that it\u2019s critical for companies to address the key drivers of income improvement \u2013 price, productivity, efficiency, land size and diversified income sources.\n\nThere are three main areas of action for a company to consider in relation to these key drivers to create an environment in which households can thrive.\n\nFirst \u2013 and arguably most important \u2013 is to ensure that the way the company does business supports farmers. By this, we mean trading practices that provide a stable market and de-risk farmers or ensure a good return on a farming household\u2019s investments. For example, through the use of conditional cash transfers or incentives.\n\nThe second is to provide agronomic support that helps farming households to improve productivity and efficiency, which can be achieved via training programs and new materials. The third is to support farming households to build better farm business management and support diversified income generation.\n\nThe Nescaf\u00e9 brand and Nestl\u00e9 more broadly have a long history of working to improve farmer livelihoods and the health of the planet. The brand\u2019s work with farmers has continued to evolve over time, starting with agronomic support and supplemented with business-skill building through \u201cagripreneurship\u201d programs. With the new pilot programs to test conditional cash incentives, the Nescaf\u00e9 program is continuing its evolution, charting new frontiers at the intersection of farmer livelihoods and regenerative agriculture. We look forward to continuing our work with Nescaf\u00e9 to calibrate program components and support learning within Nescaf\u00e9, across Nestl\u00e9 and to the broader sector. The work holds important potential for smallholder farming households and the coffee industry at large, and we are excited to be a part of the process.\n\nBrands like Nescaf\u00e9 can support farming households to build better farm business management and support diversified income generation.\n\nExternal viewpoint\n\nThe human side of regenerative agriculture\n\nKealy Sloan\nManager, Agriculture & Development\n\nSustainable Food Lab Program\n\nKealy Sloan is excited to be a part of the process. The work holds important potential for smallholder farming households and the coffee industry at large, and we are excited to be a part of the process.\nIn Brazil, Nestl\u00e9 Ninho now recognizes different levels of regenerative practices by paying tiered premiums on milk prices. These practices reduced and removed 107,000 tonnes of CO\u2082 in 2022 alone.\n\nIn Colombia, a CHF 1.6 million investment in a five-year grassland regeneration project entered its second year. Involving 38 farmers, a total of 390 hectares have been naturally regenerated \u2013 by allowing woodland to grow next to the pastureland. A total of 11,970 tonnes of CO\u2082 have been sequestered.\n\nIn Chile, Nestl\u00e9 Nido has been gradually replacing synthetic fertilizers with biofertilizers in maize, pastures and other supplementary crops. Biofertilizers offer many benefits because of their free-living bacteria, which promote plant growth, improve productivity through the strengthening of root systems, lower production costs and mitigate the emissions of greenhouse gases. In 2022, the project reduced 4,500 tonnes of CO\u2082.\n\nIn the United States, we are working with partners to measure the outcomes of regenerative practices used by pumpkin farmers supplying Libby\u2019s in central Illinois, covering more than 70 fields and over 6,000 acres. The project has collected in-field data such as tillage type, fertilizer usage, and soil sample data, to help verify and quantify the environmental benefits of the regenerative practices used to grow our pumpkins. The data showed significant gains. Introducing sustainable, reduced tillage practices saves soil from being lost to erosion as compared to conventional crop tillage practices. With the help of cover crops, soil erosion rates are 40% lower than the average for the state. Cover crops have also helped farmers reduce CO\u2082 by 732 tonnes compared with conventional practices (equivalent to removing 157 cars from the road for a year).\n\nIn China, we started a partnership with Syngenta Group to build a regenerative agriculture demonstration farm. This farm is a unique opportunity to promote regenerative agriculture trials and offer training to farmers. It also has the potential to support commercial cooperation in the supply of low-carbon wheat, corn and other raw materials.\n\nAs part of the Nescaf\u00e9 Plan 2030 strategy (see the Uplifting Lives and Livelihoods case study), we started supporting regenerative agriculture practices for coffee farmers in Brazil, China, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam in 2022.\n\nOutlook\nBy 2025, Nestl\u00e9 will invest CHF 1.2 billion to spark regenerative agriculture across our supply chains. We will continue to fund pilot projects and scale successful initiatives. We will continue working toward a common regenerative agriculture framework. We will also continue to co-invest with farmers to help them transition to regenerative agriculture, as well as pay premiums for regenerative agriculture goods. Our brands and markets will seek to develop more opportunities to launch regenerative agriculture activities around the world.\n\nPerformance\nIn 2022, we sourced 6.8% of key ingredients from farmers transitioning to regenerative agriculture methods, keeping us on track to achieve 20% by 2025 and 50% by 2030. In 2022, only the following sources are included in regenerative agriculture volumes: fresh milk, Ecuadorian cocoa, green coffee and Libby\u2019s vegetables sourced through direct procurement/Farmer Connect or for Nespresso. Nestl\u00e9 Nutrition cereals and vegetables that are traceable back to a farm/cooperative level and raw materials that are covered by the Living Soils initiative with Earthworm Foundation for Nestl\u00e9 France. The denominator includes all raw materials in scope. See our Reporting Scope and Methodology for ESG KPIs document for full details.\n\nThe Nestl\u00e9 Institute of Agricultural Sciences launched in 2022 to advance technology and research in the field.\n\nIn the north of France, Nestl\u00e9 has been working with farmers on regenerative agriculture methods since 2018. Our work is part of the Sols Vivants (Living Soils) initiative, involving partners such as Earthworm Foundation and supermarket chain Lidl. Our Purina PetCare brand joined the effort in 2020, where they are supporting the transition to regenerative agriculture methods with a big effort on agroforestry. The initiative involves mainly wheat crops but also corn, sugar beet and vegetables. Together, we are supporting farmers technically and financially to make the transition to regenerative agriculture. By the end of 2022, we engaged 180 farmers and 10 suppliers under the Sols Vivants initiative covering around 15,000 hectares in different regions, resulting in 72,000 tonnes of raw materials.\n\nIn Colombia, 300 acres of natural woodland have been regenerated.\n\n419 228 Farmers trained through Farmer Connect (435,500 in 2021)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one of the first regions to trial increased use of biofertilization. This is a win\u2013win initiative: good for the planet and good for farmers as it\u2019s also more cost\u2013effective than using synthetic fertilizer on crops like maize.\u201d\n\nEnrique Vega Dairy Strategy and Policy Manager Nestl\u00e9 Chile\n\nIn Colombia, 300 acres of natural woodland have been regenerated.\nUplifting lives and livelihoods\n\nWhat the launch of the Nescaf\u00e9 Plan 2030 means for the coffee sector.\n\nEvery second, 5500 cups of Nescaf\u00e9 are consumed around the world. One in every seven cups of coffee drunk every day is a Nescaf\u00e9. This means the brand touches the lives of hundreds of millions of people, not just in the more than 20 origin countries where its coffee is sourced, but also in the more than 175 countries where it is sold. As such, Nescaf\u00e9 has an opportunity to lead the coffee sector\u2019s sustainability drive.\n\nLaunched in 2022, the Nescaf\u00e9 Plan 2030 builds on the decade-long work of the Nescaf\u00e9 Plan and the legacy of the Nescaf\u00e9 brand, dating back to 1960, in helping coffee farmers to adopt best practices. It is highly ambitious. As part of a fully integrated strategy, Nescaf\u00e9 will help farmers use regenerative agriculture to simultaneously achieve lower GHG emissions, improved incomes and better social conditions. This will represent an investment of CHF 1 billion by 2030, supported by Nestl\u00e9\u2019s investment in its regenerative agriculture and net zero journeys.\n\nThe plan is a key part of the Nestl\u00e9 Net Zero Roadmap. With many of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s emissions originating in its agricultural supply chain, Nescaf\u00e9 aims to contribute to Nestl\u00e9\u2019s commitment to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\n\nThe plan is also aimed at delivering coffee that is 100% produced sustainably by 2025 (including assessed as deforestation-free), with 20% of the brand\u2019s coffee to be sourced from regenerative agriculture methods within the same timeframe (rising to 50% by 2030).\n\nThe plan is also aimed at delivering coffee that is 100% produced sustainably by 2025 (including assessed as deforestation-free), with 20% of the brand\u2019s coffee to be sourced from regenerative agriculture methods within the same timeframe (rising to 50% by 2030).\n\nTo achieve maximum impact, Nescaf\u00e9 plans to expand regenerative agriculture initiatives across seven countries where it sources 90% of its coffee: Brazil, Colombia, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Honduras, Indonesia, Mexico and Vietnam. In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Indonesia and Mexico, the brand is piloting a financial support mechanism to help smallholder farmers accelerate the transition to regenerative agriculture.\n\nThis is just a taste of things to come as Nescaf\u00e9 seeks to renew the world of coffee and uplift lives and livelihoods with every cup.\n\nCoffee: a catalyst for change\n\nRegenerative agriculture is an evolving concept. In 2022, coffee (along with dairy) was the first raw material where Nestl\u00e9 developed a detailed regenerative agriculture toolkit.\n\nThe toolkit defines the objective of regenerative agriculture at Nescaf\u00e9\u2014to maximize soil health, to capture carbon in the ground and to prevent its release into the atmosphere. There are three main areas of work: protecting soil health, rejuvenating coffee plots and preserving biodiversity, with the necessary actions outlined in each area.\n\nActions include training farmers in regenerative agriculture practices and \u2013 supported by the Nestl\u00e9 Global Reforestation Program \u2013 an existing pipeline of projects to plant 20 million trees in and around coffee farms in eight countries by 2026. Nescaf\u00e9 expects this will have a positive impact on biodiversity in coffee fields as well as reducing GHG emissions.\n\nWhile regenerative agriculture is central to the Nescaf\u00e9 Plan 2030, the plan is holistic. We will provide training to help farmers transition to regenerative practices and help to improve farming families\u2019 incomes. There is an emphasis on rethinking and redesigning packaging, transitioning factories to renewable energy and improving logistics to reduce emissions.\n\nTo achieve maximum impact, Nescaf\u00e9 plans to expand regenerative agriculture initiatives across seven countries where it sources 90% of its coffee: Brazil, Colombia, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Honduras, Indonesia, Mexico and Vietnam. In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Indonesia and Mexico, the brand is piloting a financial support mechanism to help smallholder farmers accelerate the transition to regenerative agriculture.\n\nThis is just a taste of things to come as Nescaf\u00e9 seeks to renew the world of coffee and uplift lives and livelihoods with every cup.\n\nNescaf\u00e9 Plan 2030 green coffee\n\nSee the full Nescaf\u00e9 Plan 2030 infographic\n\nTable of contents\n\nReduce greenhouse gas emissions\n\nIncrease farmers\u2019 income\n\nCreate better social conditions\n\nWomen and youth empowerment\n\nOptimized fertilization (including organic fertilizers)\n\nFarm renovation\n\nCover crops\n\nIncome diversification (including intercropping)\n\nAgriforestry\n\nLand restoration\n\nGreen borders (riparian buffers)\n\nFinancial support\n\nHuman rights and child protection\n\n5500 cups of Nescaf\u00e9 are consumed around the world every second\n\n\u201cClimate change is putting coffee-growing areas under pressure. Building on 10 years\u2019 experience of the Nescaf\u00e9 Plan, we\u2019re accelerating our work to help tackle climate change and address social and economic challenges in Nescaf\u00e9 value chains.\u201d\n\nDavid Nemer\nHead of Nescaf\u00e9 Coffee Program\nProtecting biodiversity\n\nThe global food system, nature and climate change are intrinsically linked. Our efforts to help protect biodiversity complement our Net Zero Roadmap.\n\nBackground\n\nBiodiversity is declining faster than ever before. Today, nearly a quarter of all animal and plant species are under the threat of extinction.\n\nThe current approach to agriculture is a contributing factor to biodiversity loss. Thriving natural ecosystems have, over the decades, been replaced with expansive farming areas. This leads to the loss of habitats, displacement of species and environmental impacts from the overuse or production of pesticides, fertilizers and manure. Yet, we depend upon biodiversity (particularly pollinators) for our business.\n\nThere is a way for agriculture to protect and restore biodiversity \u2013 switching to more regenerative practices. As a global food and beverage company, Nestl\u00e9 is working to spark regenerative agriculture practices in our supply chain (and with others in the food industry). This includes aiming to help safeguard biodiversity at the farm, landscape and global levels.\n\nApproach\n\nOur Net Zero Roadmap includes strategies that can help protect and restore biodiversity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We are leveraging lessons learned from our regenerative agriculture program and our Forest Positive strategy, and our experience in sustainable sourcing and water stewardship activities to better integrate biodiversity considerations.\n\nTo meet increasing stakeholder interest in protecting biodiversity, including from the financial sector, we have established a cross-functional working group to help guide Nestl\u00e9 strategy, particularly identifying, measuring and monitoring biodiversity impacts in our value chain. Nestl\u00e9 also supports the work of the International Chamber of Commerce and Business For Nature in calling for strong action by policymakers to safeguard natural resources.\n\nFurther information on our approach can be found in our Climate Risk and Impact report.\nHarnessing nature and its diversity as an asset are the drivers of the Nespresso vision for regenerative coffee agriculture. By 2030, Nespresso is aiming to have 95% of its green coffee volume rated bronze on the Rainforest Alliance Regenerative Coffee Scorecard (of which 70% will be gold). By 2025, 10 priority areas, representing over 60% of the area managed under the Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality\u2122 Program (in hectares), will have an action plan in place.\n\nFor Nescaf\u00e9, biodiversity is also key, as highlighted in the case study (right) on Nescaf\u00e9 Origins Colmeia limited-edition coffee, which includes a jar of honey made from local honeybees.\n\nIn C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan has been helping to restore the protected forests of B\u00e9ki and Bouss\u00e9mara near the border with Ghana. These forests are seen as a pivotal habitat for C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s elephant population, which once numbered thousands but is now estimated at just 225 elephants. Through a partnership with local cooperatives, SODEFOR, the Ministry of Water and Forests, the Rainforest Alliance and others, the Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan has reforested 43 hectares in the B\u00e9ki Forest, created management plans for a buffer zone up to five kilometers around the forest and raised awareness among community members within these buffer zones on the importance of forest protection.\n\nHedges play an important role in providing habitats for insects, birds and small mammals, and also sequester carbon. Yet, in the Netherlands, around 90% of hedgerows have been lost since 1900. Nestl\u00e9 Professional teamed up with the Hooghgeggen Foundation to help restore biodiversity in the country. For every Nescaf\u00e9 machine sold for professional use, 2.5 meters of hedgerow were planted.\n\nOutlook\nWe aim to strengthen our leadership and advocacy on biodiversity and to accelerate the integration of biodiversity considerations into our Net Zero Roadmap. We will continue to engage in various forums and global organizations on climate, nature and biodiversity to advance collective action on these critical topics.\n\nPerformance\nNestl\u00e9 and the wider food industry are continuing to develop an understanding of the importance of biodiversity and the role of business in helping safeguard it. We are an active advocate in several global forums, working groups and organizations, and we engage with investors on biodiversity on a regular basis. We participate in discussions related to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity and consistently supported the political intention to agree a Global Biodiversity Framework throughout 2022. We are a signatory to the Business for Nature COP15 business statement on mandatory assessment and disclosure on biodiversity and we have a leadership role in the International Chambers of Commerce Working Group on Biodiversity.\n\nIn 2022, we carried out an assessment to identify, monitor and measure biodiversity impacts in our supply chain, with a view to establishing a baseline for action. This builds on the steps we are already taking in many of our ingredient supply chains.\n\nFor example, we have studied the breadth of animal life present on dairy farms in Spain to assess what additional support to provide. At the 15 pilot farms assessed to date, we have distributed nearly 100 bird boxes to support bird populations. We plan to double the number of farms in this pilot by 2025.\n\nHoneybees boost coffee beans and biodiversity\n\nBees play an essential role in healthy ecosystems. However, the world\u2019s bee population is in rapid decline, posing a serious threat to global agriculture and future food supply.\n\nBees are particularly important in coffee production. Studies show bees can increase coffee crop yield, improve quality and boost sustainable coffee production.\n\nInnovative partnership\nAssisted pollination allows producers to reduce the impact of farming on the environment and preserve biodiversity. The presence of bees even helps to reduce the amount of inputs used in coffee plantations, as bees help plants consume fewer resources in production, and with increased productivity, there is also an important reduction in the carbon footprint of the farm. The project was managed with the help of technology start-up Agrobee \u2013 a company that brings beekeepers and farmers together to promote pollination and provides training in efficient management and sustainable insect practices in the field.\n\nSweet combination\nTo bring the story of this exciting collaboration to life, Colmeia is sold as a special limited-edition Arabica coffee that includes a tasty pot of honey made by the very same bees that pollinated the coffee flowers. Hexagonal packaging mimics the honeycombs and connections of the hives and can be upcycled as a vase after use.\n\nAlthough it was a first edition, the Colmeia concept is proving highly attractive. The product sold out in 120 days and earned media coverage worth BRL 7 million (USD 1.2 million) in just 30 days, so the benefit of bees can be felt across the value chain.\n\n\u201cProduced in harmony, in the same place, using the same resources, Colmeia places the power of regenerative agriculture in our hands. Colmeia provides more than compensation. It is about adding value and taking responsibility, to create a conscious brand where the whole chain of coffee beans, plants, bees and people grow stronger.\u201d\n\nTaissara Martins\nESG Manager for Coffee Brands in Brazil\n\nTable of contents\nCreating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2022 24\nRegenerating the water cycle\n\nWater is vital to all life. In our case, we depend on it in our supply chains and for our operations. Water stewardship is critical, for our business, for the communities in our value chain and for the environment.\n\nBackground\n\nIn 2022, widespread flooding and drought affected many countries around the world. This was recognized as a sign of climate change acceleration. Europe, the west of North America and China\u2019s Yangtze River area all experienced historic levels of drought. Meanwhile, devastating floods in Pakistan affected around 33 million people.\n\nThe availability of clean, safe water is under increasing threat. Water stress \u2013 where demand exceeds the amount of good quality water available \u2013 is a growing problem as the climate changes and populations increase. Unless action is taken, it is estimated that by 2050, water stress will affect more than half the world\u2019s population.\n\nAgriculture accounts for 70% of all water withdrawals worldwide. In some regions, water consumption to produce food for a growing, urbanized population is increasing pressure on the natural water cycle. In other regions, agricultural inputs such as fertilizers can potentially affect the quality of water sources.\n\nLivelihoods, health and sanitation, and biodiversity can all be affected when the water cycle is disrupted, as can food production. We depend on a reliable source of agricultural raw materials from 100 countries. Many of these supply chains are in countries where water stress is high and access to sanitation and hygiene is limited.\n\nWe recognize the need to play our part in helping to protect, restore and renew water sources. For years, we have implemented programs to continuously improve water efficiency and reduce water withdrawals in our factories, even as production volumes increase. Since 2021, our bottled-water business has gone even further \u2013 seeking to help create a positive water impact everywhere it operates.\n\nTable of contents\n\nCreating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2022 25\nApproach\nOur new Water workstream meets monthly and reports to the Head of ESG Strategy and Deployment, with oversight from the ESG and Sustainability Council.\n\nNestl\u00e9 performs regular assessments of local water resources and water use inside and outside its factories, including possible future risks. We engage with stakeholders and monitor external research findings.\n\nStrategy\nWe manage our strategy across five pillars. In each of these five pillars we consider the following four approaches:\n\n\u2013 The local and wider catchment level\n\u2013 Compliance as a minimum\n\u2013 Best practice in water resources management\n\u2013 Collective action\n\nOUR WATER PILLARS\nNestl\u00e9 factories serving our Nestl\u00e9 Waters business\nAgricultural supply chain\nNestl\u00e9 factories\nWater in communities\nWater partnerships and advocacy\n\nNestl\u00e9 Waters\nOur bottled-water business includes brands such as Perrier, S.Pellegrino, Vittel and Buxton. Our pledge is to lead the regeneration of the water cycle and to help create a positive water impact everywhere our water business operates by 2025. We have also committed to certifying all our Nestl\u00e9 Waters sites to the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Standard by 2025.\n\nAgricultural supply chain\nWe use the Nestl\u00e9 Responsible Sourcing Standard to specify what we expect in terms of water use and water management practices in our agricultural supply chains. Traceability is key to identifying areas of water risk in our supply chains. We assess the water footprint of important agricultural commodities and identify opportunities where water management practices can be improved.\n\nNestl\u00e9 factories\nWe aim to reduce water use in our factories by 6 million m\u00b3 between 2021 and 2023. We monitor water withdrawals and water quality at our factories. We promote recycling and reusing water where possible and closely monitor the quality of the water we discharge to ensure no downstream negative impact and guarantee regulatory compliance.\n\nWater in communities\nAccess to safe drinking water and sanitation is a basic human right and safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) contributes to health, well-being and community resilience. We believe businesses have a role to play in helping ensure that people have access to water and sanitation.\n\nIn addition to providing safe drinking water and sanitation for Nestl\u00e9 employees, we support access to water for the communities surrounding our direct operations and in our supply chains. Our new Human Rights Salient Issue Action Plan on the Right to Water and Sanitation, addresses our approach in this area in depth (see performance section).\n\nWater partnerships and advocacy\nWater is a shared resource, requiring collaborative care. We work together with other water users and partners to address watershed challenges and to ensure that water resources are managed in a way that is ecologically sustainable, socially equitable and economically beneficial. We are dedicated members of:\n\n\u2013 The World Economic Forum\u2019s 2030 Water Resources Group (2030 WRG), focused on sustainable water management to help countries achieve water security by 2030 through collective action.\n\u2013 The CEO Water Mandate, a UN Global Compact initiative that unites business leaders on water, sanitation and Sustainable Development Goals.\n\u2013 The WASH4Work initiative, which asks businesses to take action to address WASH challenges in the workplace, in communities where the business operates and in supply chains.\n\u2013 The Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Technical Committee and Agriculture Working Group. Nestl\u00e9 representatives have also contributed to the work of the AWS Board.\n\nAcross Nestl\u00e9, we will continue to work to achieve good water resource management throughout our operations and agricultural supply chains.\n\n100% Water discharged at our factories is monitored for quality\n\nNestl\u00e9 Waters has committed to certifying all its sites to the AWS Standard by 2025.\nA look at how Nestl\u00e9 Waters is regenerating a local water cycle in Spain.\n\nOur Viladrau water bottling plant in Spain is located in the Montseny Natural Park. Recent changes in rainfall patterns and more unpredictable storms have impacted local biodiversity. To help address this, Nestl\u00e9 Spain has adopted a series of targeted actions to protect endemic species.\n\nOur first project is aimed at restoring wetlands, in partnership with a team of local biologists and the Montseny Natural Park. Declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 1978, for many years the park was left untouched. Vegetation grew, forests became dense and the wetlands began to naturally silt up.\n\nIn March 2022, Nestl\u00e9 Spain funded the re-excavation of four interconnected ponds that had disappeared. We carefully removed silt deposits, transferred plants and protected the area from park visitors. During the process, we uncovered a spring that now helps to maintain flow and refill the ponds. Initial results show that despite one of the lower reaches of the river \u2013 with the two populations being able to naturally reach each other again.\n\nWe believe if we can demonstrate that our small actions can have an impact, we can replicate them in other areas of Spain and other countries facing similar challenges. Perhaps we can inspire even greater collaboration.\n\nThe power of teamwork\n\nThis work was a success thanks to strong relationships with partners and local stakeholders. Sharing data and knowledge has built trust over time.\n\nNext year we\u2019ll complete a project with the Natural Park to restore the Castanya River. The river has been partially blocked by landslides, following fierce storms. Water continues to flow under the debris but several aquatic species, such as the endangered Montseny newt, are unable to cross the barrier. Once the area is restored, the park team will be able to re-introduce the species to the lower reaches of the river \u2013 with the two populations being able to naturally reach each other again.\n\nWe believe if we can demonstrate that our small actions can have an impact, we can replicate them in other areas of Spain and other countries facing similar challenges. Perhaps we can inspire even greater collaboration.\n\nPerformance\n\nNestl\u00e9 Waters\n\nNestl\u00e9 Waters follows the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) International Water Stewardship Standard on all its sites. The AWS is a global membership collaboration that promotes the adoption of a universal framework for the sustainable use of water \u2013 the AWS Standard. We contribute to the work of the Technical Committee and Agriculture Working Group. Nestl\u00e9 representatives have also contributed to the work of the AWS Board and its International Standard Development Committee, which first developed the AWS standard. During 2022, 21 Nestl\u00e9 Waters sites were AWS certified (against 19 in 2021).\n\nSince 2021, Nestl\u00e9 Waters has been identifying and implementing projects designed to help regenerate local water cycles in areas where they operate. In 2022, projects included a drip irrigation program in Sheikhupura, Pakistan; pond re-vegetation to support local wildlife in Viladrau, Spain (see Nestl\u00e9 viewpoint, left); and restoring water quality in Khamon Chin canal, Thailand. These projects have delivered a volumetric water benefit of 2.3 million cubic meters so far.\n\nNestl\u00e9 Waters has shared research to develop water-positive methodologies in an open-source format, contributing to new modules of the World Resources Institute\u2019s Volumetric Water Benefit Accounting methodology. This work helps organizations and businesses calculate the volumetric water benefits of any water stewardship project.\n\nWater withdrawals at our factories\n\nThe need to improve water withdrawals and consumption was highlighted by 2021\u2019s droughts around the globe. We continuously strive to improve water savings at Nestl\u00e9 factories. In 2022, total water withdrawals at Nestl\u00e9 factories were 971 million m\u00b3 (2021: 98 million m\u00b3). We delivered absolute savings of 2.38 million m\u00b3 of water, keeping us on track to reduce water use in our factories by 6 million m\u00b3 between 2021 and 2023 as planned. The remaining reduction was due to changes in our business.\n\nOf our total water withdrawals, 36.1% were in regions with \u2018high\u2019 or \u2018extremely high\u2019 baseline water stress in 2022, a slight increase from 2021.\n\nDirect water withdrawals per tonne of total product show that Bottled water and PetCare are the most water-efficient categories. Our Confectionery and Powdered and liquid beverages categories show the greatest improvements compared to 2010.\n\nThere were five water-related incidents that incurred a fine or penalty in 2022 as per the CDP reporting framework. These incidents either pertained to exceeding certain discharge limits or were administrative in nature, and the imposed fines or penalties were not material. All incidents were reported in a timely manner to environmental authorities and resolved. We have identified the causes of these incidents and put in place measures to prevent a recurrence.\n\nWater withdrawals at our factories by product categories (m\u00b3 per tonne of product)\n\n| Category                  | 2010 | 2021 | 2022 | % reduction since 2010 |\n|---------------------------|------|------|------|------------------------|\n| Milk products             | 5.5  | 3.08 | 2.7  | 32.7                   |\n| Confectionery             | 7.2  | 3.08 | 2.68 | 62.8                   |\n| Nutrition and healthcare  | 13.6 | 8.39 | 8.68 | 36.2                   |\n| PetCare                   | 1.2  | 1.16 | 1.25 | -3.9                   |\n| Powdered and liquid beverages | 13.9 | 5.23 | 6.08 | 53.5                   |\n| Prepared mixes and cooking aids | 5.5  | 3.13 | 3.08 | 44.0                   |\n| Bottled water             | 1.7  | 1.52 | 1.48 | 13.2                   |\n\nPercentage of water withdrawn in regions with \u2018high\u2019 or \u2018extremely high\u2019 baseline water stress\n\n| Category                  | 2010 | 2021 | 2022 | % reduction since 2010 |\n|---------------------------|------|------|------|------------------------|\n| Milk products             | 36.1 | 35.4 | 36.2 | 51.5% (49.3% in 2021)   |\n| Confectionery             | 51.5 | 51.5 | 51.5 | 51.5% (49.3% in 2021)   |\n| Nutrition and healthcare  | 36.2 | 36.2 | 36.2 | 36.2% (34.0% in 2021)   |\n| PetCare                   | 36.2 | 36.2 | 36.2 | 36.2% (34.0% in 2021)   |\n| Powdered and liquid beverages | 53.5 | 53.5 | 53.5 | 53.5% (51.3% in 2021)   |\n| Prepared mixes and cooking aids | 44.0 | 44.0 | 44.0 | 44.0% (41.8% in 2021)   |\n| Bottled water             | 13.2 | 13.2 | 13.2 | 13.2% (12.0% in 2021)   |\n\nVolumetric water benefits delivered through projects\n\n| Category                  | 2010 | 2021 | 2022 | % reduction since 2010 |\n|---------------------------|------|------|------|------------------------|\n| Milk products             | 36.1 | 35.4 | 36.2 | 51.5% (49.3% in 2021)   |\n| Confectionery             | 51.5 | 51.5 | 51.5 | 51.5% (49.3% in 2021)   |\n| Nutrition and healthcare  | 36.2 | 36.2 | 36.2 | 36.2% (34.0% in 2021)   |\n| PetCare                   | 36.2 | 36.2 | 36.2 | 36.2% (34.0% in 2021)   |\n| Powdered and liquid beverages | 53.5 | 53.5 | 53.5 | 53.5% (51.3% in 2021)   |\n| Prepared mixes and cooking aids | 44.0 | 44.0 | 44.0 | 44.0% (41.8% in 2021)   |\n| Bottled water             | 13.2 | 13.2 | 13.2 | 13.2% (12.0% in 2021)   |\nWater in communities\n\nIn Q1 2023, we launched our new Human Rights Salient Issue Action Plan on the human right to water and sanitation. The action plan reinforces WASH at the heart of our water stewardship program and is aimed at focusing our attention on preventing and mitigating WASH risks in our operations and supply chain. It forms part of a suite of action plans covering all our salient human rights issues.\n\nIn terms of country-specific activity, farmers in Cauca, Colombia used Community Development Funds provided by Nespresso to build water treatment plants on local aqueducts. This will provide more than 44,000 people in these two regions with access to clean, safe drinking water.\n\nAs different communities have different priorities, it\u2019s important for us to understand their unique needs. Our Community Relations Process tool, developed in 2019, has been rolled out in our medium-to-high-risk markets. It helps identify local community members to involve in our tailored WASH interventions.\n\nWater Partnerships and Advocacy\n\nIn 2022, we began a landscape project in East Anglia, UK as part of a Landscape Enterprise Networks (LENs) initiative. This holistic regeneration initiative includes aiming to have a positive impact on water quality through planting cypress (see the A marketplace for nature-based solutions external viewpoint).\n\nNestl\u00e9, along with other WASH4Work members, signed a business declaration at the COP27 UN Climate Conference in Egypt (the latest in the UN\u2019s series of climate change summits) to mobilize the leadership and partnership needed to shape a more climate-resilient water resource management and water stewardship.\n\nSeparately, in Stockholm, during World Water Week (an annual, global event focused on water issues), Nestl\u00e9 organized a panel event alongside three NGO partners: Water Aid, the Toilet Board Coalition and the Global Water Strategy analyst Bluerisk and the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The UN Global Compact initiative CEO Water Mandate was discussed along with the \u201cwater positive\u201d concept, associated methodologies and the need to develop transformative projects with long-term benefits at the catchment level.\n\nOutlook\n\nDuring 2023, we will continue to work toward improved water resource management and water stewardship.\n\nWe are also beginning an in-depth study to estimate the water co-benefits of the agriculture and nature-based solution projects within our Net Zero Roadmap for addressing shared water challenges.\n\nAccess to safe, affordable and reliable water, sanitation and hygiene \u2013 known as WASH \u2013 is a basic human right. Yet billions of people around the world still do not have access to safe and clean water.\n\nAt Nestl\u00e9, we are in a unique position to help increase access to water and sanitation for our employees who work in our factories, for the communities living around our operations and for the people working in the farms that supply us. Our approach is twofold: assess, address, monitor and report on risks in our value chain, and engage with wider society and business to collectively help people become more water-secure and climate resilient.\n\nOur pledge evolves\n\nWe were a founding member and co-chair of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development WASH Pledge in September 2014. By signing this pledge, Nestl\u00e9 and over 50 other global businesses committed to implementing WASH for all employees in every location we operate in.\n\nSince then, the urgency to address water-related climate risks has intensified. These risks, which arise from too much water, too little water or polluted water, have a direct impact on WASH, especially for the most vulnerable. We believe it is time for companies to bring their WASH and climate actions together. This is why in November 2022, we called for businesses to apply a climate resilience framework for WASH programs through the WASH4Work platform.\n\nWater in Pakistan\n\nThe situation for communities in Pakistan is a good example of the need for this integration of programs. Pakistan is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world, with the bulk of its freshwater being used in agriculture. On top of this, in 2022, the country faced extreme drought and water shortages followed by the worst monsoon floods in a decade, with countless homes washed away and vital farmland destroyed.\n\nTo help people tackle these extreme climate change impacts and become more water secure, we identified Pakistan as one of our priority countries in our Salient Issues Action Plan on the Right to Water and Sanitation, published in Q1 2023.\n\nAll four of our factories and other sites in Kabirwala, Islamabad, Port Qasim and Sheikhupura meet the WASH Pledge requirements, strengthening the rights of over 7,500 employees. In addition, we have set up six drinking water facilities, which provide access to clean and safe water to over 60,000 people every day; and we monitor these regularly for quality.\n\nThrough our water education program, as part of Nestl\u00e9 for Healthier Kids, we reached out to 35,000 children and 250 teachers in schools in 2022 on the benefits of drinking more water. Together, our efforts ladder up to Sustainable Development Goal 6, on clean water and sanitation, and Goal 17, on partnerships for the Goals.\n\nIn the future, we plan to work with global and local stakeholders to develop and apply a climate-resilient WASH framework to our water, sanitation and hygiene programs and investments, and to continue to leverage our broad reach and influence.\nIngredients produced sustainably\n\nWe can deliver a positive impact by ensuring that the raw materials in our products have been produced sustainably and with respect for people, planet and nature.\nBackground\nWe rely on long-term supplies of high-quality, sustainably produced raw materials. Their sustainability depends on different factors, including agricultural practices used and their impact on critical forests and natural ecosystems, and the extent to which human rights and animal welfare practices are respected and promoted.\n\nChallenges related to agriculture often have their roots in or are exacerbated by poverty. Supporting communities, facilitating and incentivizing better farming practices and helping improve livelihoods are all crucial concerns at Nestl\u00e9.\n\nThe ability to map our supply chains is essential to ascertaining whether ingredients have been produced sustainably. Without traceability, we cannot assess conditions or support our suppliers \u2013 large and small \u2013 to improve.\n\nBy reporting transparently on these issues, we can push ourselves and the wider industry to meet current commitments and become increasingly ambitious in the future. Our aim is for 100% of our key ingredients to be produced sustainably by 2030.\n\nApproach\nOver the course of 2021 and 2022, we developed and refined a new Produced Sustainably Framework. This framework is designed to enable continuous improvement across Nestl\u00e9\u2019s supply chain to achieve full implementation of Human Rights and Environmental Due Diligence (HREDD) and delivery of positive impacts on people, nature and climate in Nestl\u00e9\u2019s sourcing origins.\n\nIt applies to 14 key ingredients that represent 95% of our raw materials and enhance our understanding of how they are produced.\n\nSUSTAINABLE SOURCING: OUR FOUR PILLARS OF ACTIVITY\n\n- Transparency\n  Improve traceability of the origins of our raw materials and enhance our understanding of how they are produced.\n\n- Environment\n  Contribute to conserving and restoring the environment and natural resources.\n\n- Human rights\n  Respect and promote the rights of people in our supply chains.\n\n- Animal welfare\n  Contribute to continuously improving how animals in our supply chains are treated.\n\nIn 2022, we decided to split our original key performance indicator (KPI) into two. The framework\u2019s main KPI measures the performance of volumes at origin level against the requirements of our Responsible Sourcing Standard. For 2022, we reported against that KPI, as follows:\n\n- A material is produced sustainably either when it can be traced to low-risk countries or when it has been assessed as compliant with our Responsible Sourcing Standard through one of the following means:\n  - Certification\n  - Second or third-party farm assessments\n  - On-the-ground programs in which Nestl\u00e9 directly works with producers (e.g. Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan, Nescaf\u00e9 Plan or Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality\u2122 Program).\n\nOur Responsible Sourcing Standard sets out non-negotiable requirements and ways of working with our direct suppliers, which we expect them to roll out to their own partners in turn.\n\nWe work closely with our direct suppliers to map our upstream supply chains and, where needed, to carry out farm assessments with partner organizations. If gaps are found, the supplier develops an action plan. If a supplier refuses to improve or fails to close identified gaps, we may terminate the business relationship.\n\nA second KPI measuring our suppliers\u2019 Human Rights and Environmental Due Diligence will be introduced in 2025 (see Outlook).\n\nThis is incredibly important in the state of Sabah in Northern Borneo, where palm is by far the most planted crop. Supplying 6% of the world\u2019s palm oil in 2020, the crop has driven both economic development and deforestation.\n\nEarthworm is partnering with Nestl\u00e9 on a number of initiatives, including the Sabah landscape initiative where we are driving collective action and holistic change in this critical sourcing region. We hope to show smallholder farmers what\u2019s possible when we combine sustainable economic development, forest conservation, decent work opportunities and resilient livelihoods for communities.\n\nWe bring together everyone linked to palm oil \u2013 companies like Nestl\u00e9 but also NGOs, civil society, experts, governments, mills, plantations, farmers and communities \u2013 to find the best ways to regenerate nature and improve people\u2019s lives. Our team, who come from a diverse background including the palm oil industry, works hand in hand with farmers on the ground to find pragmatic solutions that can be replicated across other commodities.\n\nExternal viewpoint\n\nHow Nestl\u00e9 and Earthworm are working to make palm oil more sustainable.\n\nConservation is something I am passionate about. I studied Forestry and began my career in the palm oil industry before I joined Earthworm. I now lead the Earthworm Foundation team in Malaysia, where we take a holistic approach to responsible sourcing across clearly defined sourcing areas, collaborating with key stakeholders from the private and public sectors, farmer associations and civil society in tackling climate change, biodiversity and human rights risks. We call it the landscape approach.\n\nThis is incredibly important in the state of Sabah in Northern Borneo, where palm is by far the most planted crop. Supplying 6% of the world\u2019s palm oil in 2020, the crop has driven both economic development and deforestation.\n\nEarthworm is partnering with Nestl\u00e9 on a number of initiatives, including the Sabah landscape initiative where we are driving collective action and holistic change in this critical sourcing region. We hope to show smallholder farmers what\u2019s possible when we combine sustainable economic development, forest conservation, decent work opportunities and resilient livelihoods for communities.\n\nWe bring together everyone linked to palm oil \u2013 companies like Nestl\u00e9 but also NGOs, civil society, experts, governments, mills, plantations, farmers and communities \u2013 to find the best ways to regenerate nature and improve people\u2019s lives. Our team, who come from a diverse background including the palm oil industry, works hand in hand with farmers on the ground to find pragmatic solutions that can be replicated across other commodities.\n\nCommunities and smallholders are the key\n\nIn parallel, we are engaging with local communities in Sabah on forest protection and restoration, as well as training smallholders on sustainability, wildlife protection, farm productivity and income diversification in Nestl\u00e9\u2019s supply chain. So, we are building solutions with a real sense of the big picture. Collectively we hope to assist 5000 smallholder farmers through conservation initiatives, income diversification and good agricultural practices. We hope to see a 50% reduction in deforestation in key sensitive areas in Sabah by 2025.\n\nAnother example of our work together is our Workers and Families Program. The industry in Sabah relies heavily on Indonesian and Filipino migrant workers, whose children often live with them in remote plantations. These children face limited access to education, healthcare and birth registration, which are all risks linked to child labor. The risks are broader than any one supply chain, so we seek to address the root causes and take a holistic approach. Our activities include developing a Child Risk Assessment Framework (CRAF) toolkit with Nestl\u00e9 in 2020, which was then piloted with a supplier in 2021 and early 2022.\n\nWe work with those who really want to transform, who want to be innovative, try new methods and inspire others. As long as the landscape approach creates economic, social and environmental value for everyone, others will replicate our actions willingly.\n\n5000\nAim to assist smallholder farmers through conservation initiatives.\n\n50%\nAim to reduce deforestation in key sensitive areas by 2025.\n\nTable of contents\n\nCreating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2022 30\nScientific approaches to regenerative agriculture\n\nIn February 2022, we announced the creation of the Nestl\u00e9 Institute of Agricultural Sciences to translate novel agricultural science into concrete applications and to identify and develop the most promising regenerative agriculture technologies. Based in Lausanne, Switzerland, the organization has a decentralized structure and incorporates Nestl\u00e9\u2019s existing plant sciences research facilities in France, as well as numerous research farms around the world.\n\nThe Institute has three focus areas: plant sciences, dairy-livestock sciences and agricultural systems sciences. In plant sciences, the team is selecting plant-based alternative ingredients for our recipes. We are also breeding coffee and cocoa varieties that combine higher productivity with disease and drought resistance. In Mexico, for example, such new coffee varieties are already delivering 50% higher yields and a 30% reduction in carbon footprint.\n\nTo decrease emissions related to our dairy sourcing, we test and validate existing and new scientific approaches including feed supplements, wearable technologies, immunological approaches and manure management options. In agricultural system sciences, our focus on new agronomic practices and methods to quantify their impact on soil health, carbon sequestration and biodiversity outcomes aims to accelerate the transition to regenerative agriculture sourcing.\n\nPerformance\n\nIn 2022, 22.9% of our key ingredients were produced sustainably, meeting our criteria for transparency, environmental and social standards, and animal welfare.\n\nTransparency\n\nMultiple commodity- and issue-specific reports were released during the year, such as the Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan Progress Report and Towards Forest Positive Cocoa report. Nespresso\u2019s The Positive Cup: Accelerate positive impact in 2022 report was published in early 2023. Nescaf\u00e9 also engaged with over 1000 registrants in a live event for the launch of the Nescaf\u00e9 Plan 2030.\n\nEnvironment\n\nIn 2022, we continued efforts to help protect and restore the environment through the implementation of our Nest Zero Roadmap. Examples of this include biodiversity impact assessments, farmer training in regenerative agriculture techniques, our Forest Positive strategy and projects to help regenerate local water cycles. For 2022, for the first time, we are reporting progress toward our commitment to source 20% of our key ingredients through regenerative agriculture methods by 2025.\n\nNotably, our network of at least 25 pilot farms in 15 countries aiming for net zero continues to serve as a proof of concept for reducing and removing greenhouse gas emissions, using cutting-edge technology and regenerative farming methods.\n\nIn palm oil, we remain committed to sourcing 100% Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certified supplies in 2023, even if there is today already a large market supply shortage of RSPO-certified palm kernel oil. We are working with industry bodies to demonstrate, regardless of this market situation, our 100% commitment to the due date.\n\nHuman rights\n\nDuring 2022, we worked closely with external expert organizations to develop action plans that address 10 salient issues identified in our Human Rights Framework and Roadmap. These were published in Q3 2023.\n\nWe also saw progress on existing programs that address human rights. During the year, the volume of cocoa sourced through the Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan increased to 68.3% of total cocoa sourced. The plan extended its coverage in Brazil and the groundwork was laid to bring producers in Cameroon and Nigeria into the plan. The program is designed to improve livelihoods in cocoa-growing communities, covering 3462 farmers in Brazil.\n\nAnimal welfare\n\nAll of the eggs that we purchase for our food products are now certified cage-free in Europe and the United States and 71.1% are cage-free worldwide. We are on track to achieve 100% cage-free eggs globally by 2025.\n\nNespresso\n\nThe Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality\u2122 Program is a coffee sourcing program designed to ensure the continued supply of high-quality coffee while improving the livelihoods of farmers and their communities, and protecting the environment.\n\nSince 2009, Nespresso has reduced the carbon footprint of a Nespresso cup of coffee by 24%.* The AAA Program pays premiums for coffee that has been grown according to AAA principles. In 2022, the AAA Program integrated the newly released Rainforest Alliance Regenerative Coffee Scorecard. The Scorecard is designed with a continuous improvement approach to regenerative agriculture, from achieving greater efficiencies to the redesign of farms. It outlines three performance ratings: bronze, silver and gold according to the adoption of identified regenerative practices across criteria on soil, ecosystems, crops and financial management. As part of this scorecard, through the Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality\u2122 Program farmers are compensated for making a positive contribution to nature by adopting regenerative practices and producing in ways that restore and protect biodiversity in and around production areas.\n\nIn April 2022, Nespresso became B Corp-certified, joining a global community of businesses that meet the highest standards of sustainability and social responsibility.\n\n* Carbon footprint reduction of a cup of 40ml of Nespresso coffee in 2020 measured by independent external partner Quantis.\nOutlook\nIn 2022, we refined our Produced Sustainably framework and decided to split our original KPI into two. From 2025, we will report a second KPI, which will assess the maturity of our direct suppliers\u2019 Human Rights and Environmental Due Diligence (HREDD) management systems and processes. This KPI is designed to help us comply with mandatory HREDD legislation and ensure that suppliers are cascading HREDD requirements throughout the supply chain. This new KPI will be in addition to the existing produced sustainably indicator, which assesses the performance of volumes at a production level against social, environmental and animal welfare criteria set out in our Responsible Sourcing Standard.\n\nAdditionally, we will begin tracking progress against the implementation of our salient issue action plans, published in Q1 2023, as identified in our Human Rights Framework and Roadmap. These are crucial to strengthen our level of due diligence across our value chain and to support enabling environments for the respect and promotion of human rights.\n\nA grain of hope\n\nLowering our carbon footprint in rice farming.\n\nAgriculture holds huge potential for improving lives and helping to protect the environment. With this in mind, over the last two years we implemented two regenerative agriculture pilot programs in our rice supply chain in the United States. Through this, we hoped to reduce CO\u2082 emissions, water and fertilizer usage, and input costs for farmers \u2013 helping to boost their margins.\n\nOur US-based Purina PetCare brand is Nestl\u00e9\u2019s largest rice user, so we joined forces with the sustainable rice program of brewing company Anheuser-Busch and Indigo Agriculture \u2013 an innovative agtech company leveraging science and technology to help improve the sustainability and profitability of the agriculture industry. We partnered further with Indigo to trial a program within Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Gerber brand.\n\nThe Indigo technical team knows what it takes to make a difference thanks to real-world experience \u2013 many of their experts are former or active rice farmers. At the Bowers Farm, a 1800-hectare father-and-son operation in Arkansas that produces rice for Gerber, we trialed a sustainable farming program to reduce emissions, nitrogen usage and groundwater usage. These programs support farmers in their transition toward more sustainable farming practices across their operations.\n\nFrom hands-on advice at the farm to remote technical support, the Indigo team brought new ideas to life for Bowers and other Arkansas rice farmers, such as minimizing tillage, alternate wetting and drying irrigation, precision drone-controlled crop spraying and furrow irrigation.\n\nIndigo has worked with the Climate Action Reserve to help develop the most rigorous soil carbon methodology on the market \u2013 and is currently the only soil carbon program that has produced credits at scale under this standard.\n\nOutstanding results\nThe newly adopted regenerative agriculture practices at the Bowers farm achieved the desired effect without any reduction in yield. This win-win, pragmatic and collaborative approach by Indigo is helping convince farmers like Trey Bowers to place their trust in Nestl\u00e9\u2019s regenerative agriculture practices.\n\nAnd the Bowers farm is just one example. In total, our Purina PetCare program encompassed 72,000 bushels from nine farmers. It is expected to save over 461 million liters of water and create GHG savings of 300 tonnes of CO\u2082.\n\nAlready the potential of the project is clear. Scale up toward 2023-2025 is estimated to deliver 83,000 tonnes of CO\u2082 savings \u2013 the equivalent of taking 6000 cars off the road for three years \u2013 across 190,000 cumulative acres of land, an area about the size of New York City.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all about wanting this world to stay sustainable and to keep everything for everybody to have long term. I\u2019m trying to leave something for my kids. I want Bowers to be in a place where if they want to farm, they can just farm.\u201d\n\nTrey Bowers\nFarmer\n\nTechnology has a role to play in regenerative agriculture \u2013 including advanced monitoring.\n\nPrecision crop spraying by drone can reduce chemical usage and carbon footprints.\n\nMore CO\u2082 can be captured in the soil by adopting regenerative agriculture.\nAdvancing human rights throughout agricultural value chains is key to the transition toward a fairer, more regenerative global food system and building a more resilient future for our planet and its people.\n\nBackground\nPeople and respect for human rights are at the core of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s culture and values and an intrinsic part of the transition to a just, equitable and regenerative food system.\n\nProviding fair and resilient livelihoods with safe and dignified work, while reducing inequalities, can advance and promote human rights. At the same time, contributions to global emissions can be reduced by accelerating the transition to regenerative practices. We want to reward farmers in our supply chains for producing quality ingredients and making positive contributions to their communities and the environment.\n\nWe aim to use our scale, experience and resources to contribute to this vision, by raising awareness of human rights, promoting best practices and empowering people across our operations and within our supply chains.\n\nWe were early adopters of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. We have also piloted multiple programs to assess and remedy risks on the ground.\n\nThrough strong governance, forward-looking advocacy and leading transparency, we want to be at the forefront of our industry. Our work in this area will further strengthen our contribution to the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our Human Rights Framework and Roadmap \u2013 and the resultant action plans addressing our salient issues \u2013 will help us stay ahead of emerging human rights due diligence legislation in different markets where we operate.\n\nApproach\nWe have been working to incorporate human rights in all aspects of our business for many years. Today, human rights elements have been mainstreamed into 22 Nestl\u00e9 policies and embedded across our governance structures.\n\nOur board-level Sustainability Committee will ensure that we carry out due diligence and report on our most severe human rights-related risks. It also oversees our compliance with our pledges and the regulatory framework.\n\nIn addition, our ESG and Sustainability Council advises our executive management on making informed and fact-based decisions to manage salient issues in the upstream supply chain. It is supported by the work of an internal Human Rights Community of around 40 people from different functions with human rights responsibilities.\nDue diligence is at the heart of our new Human Rights Framework\n\nTo enhance our ability to assess, address and report on human rights risks, we have developed dedicated action plans for each of our salient issues.\n\nOur action plans are designed to articulate our strategy for assessing, addressing and reporting on each salient issue, defining what we need to do across our value chain, as well as what collective action can be taken. They are supported by the following enablers:\n\n**Enabler 1** Governance and incentives\nWe will integrate human rights at all levels of our governance structure.\n\n**Enabler 2** Policies and control systems\nWe will leverage our policies and control systems to ensure human rights are embedded throughout the organization.\n\n**Enabler 3** Engagement and advocacy\nWe will engage with key stakeholders and advocate for smart due diligence legislation and collective action on the ground.\n\n**Enabler 4** Strategic partnerships\nWe will partner with thought-leading and boots-on-the-ground organizations.\n\n**Enabler 5** Transparency and reporting\nWe will provide a high-level of transparency of the progress we make and the challenges we face.\n\n**Due Diligence**\n\n**Assess \u2013 Address \u2013 Report**\n\n**Salient Issues**\n\n**Action Plans**\n\n---\n\n**Nestl\u00e9 viewpoint**\n\n**Connecting the dots**\n\nBarbara Wettstein\nHuman Rights Manager, Sustainable Sourcing\n\n**Operationalizing our human rights action plans.**\n\nAfter 13 years in Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Public Affairs team I made the unusual move from a communications role to an operational one in Nestl\u00e9, as a Human Rights Manager. I\u2019m grateful to Nestl\u00e9 for the opportunity because it is a chance for me to dive deeper into the nitty gritty of this important topic. My main challenge over the next 12 months will be the operationalization of our salient issue action plans in the supply chain.\n\nWhat excites me is not just the importance of this work, but the challenge involved. To bring our salient issue action plans to life, we will need teamwork across a huge spectrum of the company, breaking down silos and connecting the dots. This is because human rights is such an interconnected topic that touches on multiple areas, such as our climate, water, regenerative agriculture, sustainable sourcing and Forest Positive strategies, among others.\n\nWe need to look at human rights from a systems perspective. For example, Indigenous Peoples\u2019 and Local Communities\u2019 land rights and deforestation risks are clearly linked, so it makes sense for teams to combine efforts and resources to deal with the root causes of both. My role is to ensure there is a thread that links human rights initiatives across all our 14 key ingredients and build synergies across the different projects my sustainable sourcing colleagues are driving.\n\nThis truly cross-commodity approach will give us the chance to learn from best practices already used in some areas of the business and apply them to others \u2013 introducing consistent systems, processes and tools where needed.\n\n---\n\n**A clearer understanding**\n\nOverall, implementing the action plans will give us a better understanding of the risks we face and help make sure we invest our time and resources in the right places. Some of the granularity required might seem time consuming now but in the long term the approach will make the team more efficient and systematic.\n\nWe will, of course, continue to complement our efforts in our supply chains with collective action. We will promote collaboration between our multiple stakeholders and work to strengthen the links between Nestl\u00e9\u2019s global and market-level teams \u2013 particularly those in priority countries identified by our action plans through a risk assessment. And we will engage with civil society and government to enable the right conditions to tackle the root causes of human rights risks in order to trigger a positive impact on the ground.\n\nWe\u2019ve learnt a lot over the years about how to enhance our ability to assess, address and report transparently on human rights risks. Now we\u2019re further strengthening that approach. It will be challenging. There are many moving pieces \u2013 all going at different speeds. So, it will take time to create synergies and bring different areas up to the next level. But, by bringing the big picture into focus, we aim to ultimately accomplish real change on the ground.\n\n---\n\n**Our Human Rights Framework**\n\nOur Human Rights Framework and Roadmap, published in 2021, describes our multifaceted role in promoting a just transition that prioritizes people. It places due diligence at the core of our approach and defines the five enablers that support our work.\n\nIt also identifies 10 salient issues where human rights may be most at risk in our business and value chain. We published action plans for each of these salient issues in Q1 2023 and have committed to reporting on our progress in implementing them by 2025.\n\nStakeholder engagement and partnerships have long been an important part of our strategy. We collaborate with a wide range of organizations on human rights issues, such as the Fair Labor Association and the International Cocoa Initiative, among many others.\n\nBy 2025, we will report on our progress on implementing all our salient issue action plans.\n\n---\n\n**Table of contents**\n\nCreating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2022 34\nNow published, we will start implementing these action plans in 2023. To maximize effectiveness, each action plan will be integrated into relevant ingredient strategies, such as the Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan for cocoa, the Nescaf\u00e9 Plan 2030 for coffee and our dairy sourcing strategy.\n\nWe are also developing reporting indicators for each action plan. We continue to train new employees on human rights through mandatory training and will be updating training for specific functions as action plans are rolled out.\n\nOur salient issues\n- Right to water and sanitation\n- Living income and living wage\n- Forced labor and responsible recruitment\n- Health and safety at work\n- Gender equity, non-discrimination and non-harassment\n- Freedom of association and collective bargaining\n- Indigenous Peoples\u2019 and Local Communities\u2019 land rights\n- Data protection and privacy\n- Child labor and access to education\n- Right to food and access to nutritious, affordable and adequate diets\n\nImproving human rights can bring wider benefits\nOur action plans shine a spotlight on how integral human rights are to all parts of our business. Respecting and promoting human rights is key to delivering our wider commitments and our journey to advance regenerative food systems at scale.\n\nFor example, our income accelerator program in cocoa (see the Toward a living income case study) demonstrates how we can help improve incomes and contribute to addressing poverty, which in turn reduces child labor risks and deforestation risks. Similarly, addressing the right to food and improving access to nutritious, affordable food is part of our wider ambitions for enhancing nutrition. This action plan follows a collaboration between Nestl\u00e9 and Tufts University, which examined the nexus between the right to food and regenerative food systems. The right to water and sanitation can be linked to our work on helping to protect the quality of natural waters and stewarding water resources.\n\nOur long-term Forest Positive strategy, published in 2021, is helping us embed protection for Indigenous Peoples\u2019 and Local Communities\u2019 land rights, while helping smallholder farmers develop sustainable livelihoods.\n\nPerformance\nIn 2022, we developed action plans for our salient issues and published them in Q1 2023. These plans are the critical link between our ambitions for advancing human rights and our ability to accomplish real change on the ground, all while strengthening our due diligence approach.\n\nAction plans work by initiating direct steps across our value chain to assess and address human rights risks, and to monitor and report on prevention and remediation activities. They are also an expression of how we can use our influence to actively support collective engagement and collaboration between stakeholders to address the root causes of human rights issues.\n\nOur internal Human Rights Community worked with external expert organizations to jointly create action frameworks, core actions and timelines. For instance, to develop the action plan on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 and Local Communities\u2019 Land Rights, we worked with Proforest and Landesa, on living income we worked with Sustainable Communities\u2019 Land Rights, we worked with Proforest and\n\nTable of contents\nCreating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2022 35\n\n| Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation System performance |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire                                           |\n| 168 506 Cumulative total number of children who have received support |\n| 8155 Number of children identified who reported no longer engaging in activities posing a risk of child labor at the two most recent follow-up visits (6307 in 2021, 4838 in 2020) |\n\n| Ghana |\n|-------|\n| 6312 Cumulative total number of children who have received support |\n| 819 Number of children identified who reported no longer engaging in activities posing a risk of child labor at the two most recent follow-up visits (738 in 2021, 693 in 2020) |\n\n| Table of contents |\n|-------------------|\n| Creating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2022 35 |\n\n| Tackling child labor risks in cocoa |\n|------------------------------------|\n| In early 2022, the Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan announced the launch of an innovative income accelerator program, primarily to help tackle child labor risks (see the Toward a living income case study). |\n\nThe Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan has long been innovative. We were the first company in the cocoa sector to introduce a Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation System (CLMRS) in our supply chain and many companies have now adopted this as a leading tool for tackling child labor risks by working directly with communities on the ground. Our CLMRS prioritizes access to education, including building and renovating schools and securing birth certificates for registration.\n\nThe CLMRS is a multi-stage process that starts with raising awareness. Community Liaison People visit farmers and cooperatives and, based on visits and surveys, identify children at risk. We carry out follow-up visits with each of these children and record the number who report that they are no longer at risk during two consecutive visits. In 2022, the number of children identified who reported no longer engaging in activities posing a risk of child labor at the two most recent follow-up visits was 8155 in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and 819 in Ghana.\n\nIn the last year the Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan expanded its reach, to cover 68.0% of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s cocoa supply (up from 50.6%) last year, including a greater presence in Brazil.\n\n| Nestl\u00e9 has been helping to tackle child labor risks in West Africa since 2012 |\n|-----------------------------|\n| 2021 2022 |\n| Children covered by CLMRS to prevent child labor risks | 69 318 72 232 |\n| Children covered by CLMRS to prevent child labor risks | 94 748 98 674 |\n| Total number of children who received support | 20 424 11 532 |\n| Total number of children who received support | 10 711 94 797 |\n| Total number of children who received support | 5 678 15 669 |\n| Total number of children who received support | 28 059 35 863 |\nToward a living income\n\nWhy farmers\u2019 incomes matter.\n\nWe are working to help address a number of risks in our supply chains, from child labor to deforestation. Often, these challenges seem unrelated. Yet there is often a common underlying cause: poverty.\n\nWe strongly believe that farming families should earn an income that allows them to maintain a decent standard of living. Over the years, we have worked to help improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers by promoting income diversification, improving productivity, empowering women and creating village savings and loans associations \u2013 often in places with no access to banking services. In 2022, we took a major step forward.\n\nNestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan \u2013 Income Accelerator Program\n\nIn early 2022, following a successful pilot, the Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan launched an innovative income accelerator program. The program aims to tackle child labor risks by incentivizing and supporting change in cocoa farming households, helping them toward a living income. It does this through a cash incentive, directly paid to the cocoa-farming family through mobile money, and support across four areas: pruning to improve cocoa farm productivity, child education, agroforestry and additional incomes. Women and gender equality are a key focus.\n\nThe program is now being tested at scale with over 10,000 farming households in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Cocoa farm productivity is supported through training, equipping and subsidizing pruning groups. Agroforestry is supported by distributing forest and fruit trees, while additional incomes for women are supported through setting up village savings and loans associations combined with gender and entrepreneurship training. In the first year, 10,186 hectares were pruned by 385 pruning groups, 210,570 forest and fruit trees were distributed and 17,144 people have already been registered to receive mobile payments through the program. KIT Royal Tropical Institute is evaluating the impact of the program and we will publish results.\n\nOutlook\n\nOur immediate priority is to begin implementing our salient issue action plans. We will carefully monitor progress to ensure they are effective.\n\nWe are monitoring the income accelerator program and expect to assess its effectiveness in late 2023. Should this initial phase prove successful, we plan to scale up to 30,000 farmers across C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana in 2024. The Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan will continue to expand worldwide, notably in Brazil, Cameroon, Ecuador, Mexico and Nigeria.\n\nSupport for progress toward living income is a focus of the Nescaf\u00e9 Plan 2030 and will also form part of our strategies for dairy sourcing.\n\nCoffee\n\nOur coffee business is also working to help farmers reach a living income, for example through the Nescaf\u00e9 Plan 2030, announced in October 2022 (see the Uplifting lives and livelihoods case study). Nespresso is working with Fairtrade and other NGO partners to help maximize and protect the incomes of farmers in its Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality\u2122 Program.\n\nNescaf\u00e9 and Nespresso are also active members of the International Coffee Organization\u2019s taskforce, which contains a working group led by the non-profit organization Sustainable Food Lab, exploring living income for coffee farmers.\n\nCoffee berries being harvested. Both Nescaf\u00e9 and Nespresso are implementing living income initiatives to ensure coffee farming families earn a living wage.\n\nNescaf\u00e9 \u2013 incentivizing regenerative, resilient coffee farming\n\nDuring 2022, Nescaf\u00e9 started pilots in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Indonesia and Mexico as part of the Nescaf\u00e9 Plan 2030. The objective is to help and incentivize smallholder farmers to accelerate their transition to regenerative agriculture practices. All pilots include conditional cash incentives for adopting regenerative agriculture practices. Other complementary measures will be added, such as income protection with weather insurance and greater access to credit lines for farmers. Nescaf\u00e9 will monitor progress throughout 2023 with support from the impact assessment partnership with Rainforest Alliance, as well as specialized partners such as the Sustainable Food Lab, which is developing capabilities for farmer income assessment, strategy and progress tracking.\n\nA farmer working with Nespresso\u2019s AAA Sustainable Quality\u2122 Program in Indonesia.\n\nAs part of the income accelerator program, I also received bonuses which notably enabled me to send my children to school and which also enabled me to take on workers for clearing the field and the brigade group to prune the rest of my plot. So it helped me on those plans.\u201d\n\nAlou Ngoran Aim\u00e9\nCocoa Farmer in Tafissou\n\nVideo: Income accelerator program\n\nCreating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2022 36\nWe use our R&D expertise to offer a wide range of foods, beverages and nutrition services at scale, helping to bring tasty and balanced diets within reach for billions of people across all occasions and life stages.\n\nBackground\nGood nutrition is fundamental to everyone\u2019s health and well-being. A balanced diet should provide all the nutrients and hydration a person needs to remain healthy at their stage in life, in an affordable and sustainable manner. Food also brings people together in daily life and on special occasions.\n\nHowever, many people around the world are either not getting enough food or eating too much food with limited nutrients, leading to malnutrition, undernutrition, vitamin and mineral deficiencies or obesity. Affordability is a key concern \u2013 an estimated three billion people cannot afford a nutritious diet. Today, making nutritious and sustainable food affordable and accessible to all is more important than ever.\n\nWith our extensive portfolio, Nestl\u00e9 is well placed to help address these challenges. We aim to provide tasty, nutritious and affordable products to people of all life stages around the world, while inspiring people to enjoy food that supports their health. In this way, we can help bring tasty and balanced diets within the reach of billions of people.\n\nOur science-based approach to nutrition\nThrough our R&D organization, we innovate with purpose to unlock the power of food for today and for generations to come. Our breakthrough discoveries provide the scientific basis for innovations, from nutrition and health research to food safety, material sciences, agricultural sciences and packaging. We translate discoveries into tasty, nutritious, affordable and sustainable products at our R&D centers for specific categories, such as dairy, coffee, culinary, confectionery, infant nutrition and petcare.\n\nOur innovation focus includes:\n- Delivering early-life, medical and pet nutritional solutions backed by strong science\n- Developing technologies to reduce nutrients of concern, while innovating more nutrient-dense products by increasing positive nutrients and ingredients\n- Making nutritious products affordable and delivering technologies for micronutrient fortification\n- Providing nutritious plant-based products across categories, brands and geographies\n- Strengthening our agriculture sciences expertise to enable the transition toward regenerative food systems\n\nOur regional R&D centers in Africa, China, India, Latin America and Southeast Asia tailor innovations to local nutritional needs and preferences.\nNestl\u00e9 has committed to reduce sodium in our global portfolios by 2025 and 2030 in key categories.\n\n**Approach**\n\nOur focus is on improving the nutritional value of our products, offering the pleasure people look for in food through products that are affordable, nutritious and sustainably produced, and on guiding people toward responsible consumption where it matters most.\n\n**Improving the nutritional value of our products**\n\nWe are continuously improving the nutritional profile of our products by adding more whole grains, proteins and fibers while reducing sugars, sodium and saturated fats \u2013 without compromising taste.\n\nWe have committed to reduce sodium in frequently consumed products by 2025 and 2030. The commitment sets maximum limits of salt for different categories of products, from noodles to snacks and sauces. Initial reductions are targeted for the end of 2025 and a second set of further reductions by 2030.\n\nOur peer-reviewed nutrient-profiling system has been helping us to improve the nutritional value of our products for decades. We recently incorporated a new feature to benchmark against the global food supply, using an algorithm published in 2021 (Nutrients. 2021 Feb 9;13(2):576). The algorithm considers five nutrients recognized by the World Health Organization: sugar, saturated fat, sodium, fiber and protein. Defined by dietary guidelines, this evolving profiling system is the base of our internal formulation targets that are category specific and technically feasible.\n\n**Affordable nutrition**\n\nProduct access and affordability are more important than ever given the social and economic instability and supply chain constraints the world is facing. Nestl\u00e9 remains committed to providing essential food products in markets worldwide. Our offer includes widely consumed items such as Maggi bouillon, dairy products and porridges. Many of our affordable products contribute to addressing common deficiencies through micronutrient fortification.\n\n**Plant-based products**\n\nDemand for plant-based products continues to create opportunities for new products across our portfolio, which also contribute to our sustainability goals. Our expertise in proteins, nutrition, plant science and culinary arts enables us to develop tasty, nutritious and sustainable plant-based products across brands, categories, formats and geographies.\n\n**Guiding responsible consumption**\n\nWe believe all our products can play a role in a balanced diet. To guide responsible consumption, we provide information and services to help people make healthier choices as part of a balanced diet. Examples include:\n\n- Voluntarily implementing evidence-based and government-endorsed front-of-pack nutritional labeling schemes such as the Health Star Rating and Nutri-Score\n- Carefully designed portion sizes for treats \u2013 allowing for indulgence in moderation\n- Recipes and guidance for pairing our foods with fresh ingredients to create balanced meals.\n\n**Responsible marketing**\n\nWe advertise our products according to strict policies \u2013 especially when it comes to how we communicate to children and how we promote breast-milk substitutes. These include the Nestl\u00e9 Marketing Communication to Children Policy and the Nestl\u00e9 Policy and Procedures for the Implementation of the WHO International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes. In addition, we publish an annual compliance report on our policy for implementing the WHO Code on the Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes. This report provides insight on Nestl\u00e9\u2019s robust WHO Code compliance system and highlights that when cases of non-compliance are discovered, Nestl\u00e9 takes swift actions to address them.\n\n**Nestl\u00e9 for Healthier Kids**\n\nChild malnutrition remains a key societal challenge that has many forms: under-nutrition, overweight and obesity, and micronutrient deficiencies. Over 340 million children and adolescents aged 5-19 are overweight or obese. With the Nestl\u00e9 for Healthier Kids program (N4HK), we bring together all our efforts to support parents and caregivers to raise healthier kids and to inspire children themselves. Through nutrition education and services, we help promote balanced diets and healthy lifestyle habits for children aged 3 to 12 years, encouraging kids and parents to:\n\n- Eat balanced meals, with more fruits and vegetables\n- Eat managed portions\n- Drink water\n- Be physically active\n\nNutrient profiling is a great tool for improving nutrient density, taking into account local context including dietary guidelines. During the symposium, a panel of experts concluded that fortifying foods with locally relevant micronutrients remains a cost-effective strategy to address micronutrient deficiencies and gaps for vulnerable and marginalized populations. Adequate processing and technologies can help preserve or even enhance nutritional value, for example by improving micronutrient availability while providing safe and tasty products.\n\nWhile increasing dietary diversity and nutrient density are key aspects in improving diets, managing portion size also has great potential. Eating more foods that are low in energy but high in nutrients, such as vegetables and fruits, while eating less foods that are high in energy is in line with dietary recommendations. Research shows that individual responses to meals vary greatly between people even when consuming identical foods. Predicting these responses to foods and personalizing diets present big opportunities for preventing illness. However, this approach is not available or affordable for many people today.\n\nTranslating all this knowledge into action requires a cross-functional food systems approach that delivers innovative solutions. These solutions must be evidence based, adapted to the local economic and cultural context and able to address challenges related to climate change, a growing world population and increasing malnutrition, while effectively managing trade offs. Additionally, there is need for collective action from governments and private-sector companies. We remain inspired by the insightful presentations and discussions and motivated to continue working together in transitioning to regenerative food systems that provide balanced and affordable diets.\n\n**Why nutritional quality needs to be addressed holistically**\n\nTo explore external and diverse scientific perspectives on nutrition and health, in 2022 we hosted the 15th edition of the Nestl\u00e9 International Nutrition Symposium at Nestl\u00e9 Research in Switzerland.\n\nIt is well acknowledged that we can only meet the needs of a growing world population through innovation, while helping to protect the environment and tackle climate change. The interconnectedness of these topics led us to choose the theme \u201cPreserving nutritional goodness from farm to fork\u201d. More than 20 leading inter-disciplinary experts from around the globe shared current scientific evidence, with a view to driving action on how we produce and provide healthy, affordable, sustainable and culturally acceptable diets for all.\n\nThere was a consensus on the urgency of providing nutrient-dense foods that are affordable and produced in a sustainable manner. Experts concluded that nutritional value should be considered from farm level, since agronomic practices and technologies can help maintain and enhance the nutritional quality of the raw materials we use in our products. For example, growing biofortified wheat in Ethiopia can help ensure that at-risk children get enough zinc.\n\nNutrient profiling is a great tool for improving nutrient density, taking into account local context including dietary guidelines.

We need action on all fronts: modest diets, increase production, reduce waste and improve food governance. If we fail on food we fail on everything.\u201d\n\nSir Professor Charles Godfrey\n\nKeynote speaker at the Nestl\u00e9 International Nutrition Symposium\n\n**Preserving nutritional goodness from farm to fork**\n\nPeta Klaasen Wigger\n\nGlobal Scientific Advisor Nutrition and Health\n\n**Table of contents**\n\nCreating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2022\nNestl\u00e9 is the first company to use the Health Star Rating (HSR) system as the basis for transparently reporting nutritional values for our entire global portfolio.\n\nHSR is a well-respected nutrient profiling system used on front-of-pack nutrition labels in many countries and applied by the Access to Nutrition Initiative (ATNI). HSR ratings provide products on the total energy, saturated fat, sodium and sugar content, which can increase the score, as well as the fibre, protein, fruit, vegetables, nuts and legumes content, which can increase the score.\n\nWe believe that all products can play a role in a balanced diet. Given our broad global portfolio, we provide visibility of the nutritional value of four different groups of products:\n\n- Products with a calculated HSR of less than 1.5. These products are occasional enjoyment related categories, which provide specific or targeted nutrition benefits and for which the HSR system generally does not apply.\n- Products with a calculated HSR of 1.5 to less than 3.5. We aim to improve the nutritional value while providing portion guidance, recipes, tips, and advice for balanced diets.\n- Products with a calculated HSR of 3.5 or above. We keep or even improve the nutritional value with positive nutrients such as whole grains and vegetables.\n- Specialized nutrition products sold by our Nutrition and Nestl\u00e9 Health Science (NHS) businesses, which provide specific or targeted nutrition benefits and for which the HSR system generally does not apply.\n\nFor the first two groups, what we call our occasional enjoyment related categories, we complement our actions with stricter responsible marketing practices. We also provide nutrition education programs, services and support covering all categories, to help people make informed choices and enjoy all foods as part of a balanced diet.\n\nAs PetCare is an important category for Nestl\u00e9, for additional transparency we report two sets of figures, one excluding PetCare sales within the Specialized nutrition category and one including PetCare sales.\n\nIn 2022, 37% of net sales excluding PetCare came from products with a HSR of 3.5 or above and 20% from products for meeting specialized nutrition needs.\n\nThe nutritional value of our portfolio*\n\n| Country | HSR 3.5 and above | HSR 1.5 to 3.5 | HSR less than 1.5 | Other** |\n|---------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|---------|\n| France  | 44%               | 37%            | 19%              | 10%     |\n| Germany | 51%               | 40%            | 19%              | 10%     |\n| Japan   | 51%               | 40%            | 19%              | 10%     |\n| Malaysia| 51%               | 40%            | 19%              | 10%     |\n| Australia/New Zealand | 41% | 30% | 29% | 10% |\n| UK      | 41%               | 30%            | 29%              | 10%     |\n| China   | 41%               | 30%            | 29%              | 10%     |\n\n* Excludes products that are not foods or beverages for consumption, and some recent acquisitions.\n** Other includes products from our PetCare business, non-food items such as coffee machines, and food products not in scope for the local nutrient profiling system, such as pure coffee in some cases. The detailed scope of assessed products in each country is available in our Nutritional Value Transparency Reporting Scope and Methodology.\n\nIn the UK, 69% of our portfolio is in scope for the UK Nutrient Profiling Model, which assigns foods as either \u2018High in Fat, Sugar and Salt\u2019 (HFSS), or not. This model is not a FOP labelling scheme. Most of our products in scope of the UK system are classified favourably as \u201cnon-HFSS\u201d.\n\nIn Singapore, the Healthier Choice Symbol system is applied. This voluntary system provides specific nutrition criteria for a range of categories, and 87% of net sales in Singapore are from products in scope for the scheme.\n\nIn Thailand, the Healthier Choice Logo system is applied. This system provides specific nutrition criteria for a range of categories, and 74% of net sales in Thailand are from products in scope for the scheme.\n\nIn Brazil, the front-of-pack legislation will take effect in October 2023.\n\nIn Mexico, the implementation of warning legends has started in October 2020.\n\nIn Peru, specialized nutrition products and foods and beverages without warning legends represent 35% of our sales.\n\nIn Chile, specialized nutrition products and foods and beverages without warning legends represent 37% of our sales.\n\nIn Latin America, several Latin American countries have implemented mandatory nutritional labelling schemes based on nutrient-specific warning legends. Although these appear similar, each country has specific criteria. For example, the energy content of foods and beverages is a separate criterion in Argentina, Chile and Mexico only.\n\nIn Argentina, the front-of-pack legislation will take effect in May 2023.\n\nIn the UK, the Healthier Star Rating (HSR) FOP scheme is voluntarily applied. Products in scope for the HSR contribute to 51% of total net sales in these two countries.\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand, the Health Star Rating (HSR) FOP scheme is voluntarily applied. Products in scope for the HSR contribute to 51% of total net sales in these two countries.\n\nIn Thailand, the Healthier Choice Logo system is applied. This voluntary system provides specific nutrition criteria for a range of categories, and 56% of net sales in Malaysia are from products in scope for the scheme.\n\nIn Malaysia, the Healthier Choice Logo system is applied. This voluntary system provides specific nutrition criteria for a range of categories, and 56% of net sales in Malaysia are from products in scope for the scheme.\n\nIn the UK, 69% of our portfolio is in scope for the UK Nutrient Profiling Model, which assigns foods as either \u2018High in Fat, Sugar and Salt\u2019 (HFSS), or not. This model is not a FOP labelling scheme. Most of our products in scope of the UK system are classified favourably as \u201cnon-HFSS\u201d.\n\nIn Singapore, the Healthier Choice Symbol system is applied. This voluntary system provides specific nutrition criteria for a range of categories, and 87% of net sales in Singapore are from products in scope for the scheme.\n\nIn Thailand, the Healthier Choice Logo system is applied. This system provides specific nutrition criteria for a range of categories, and 74% of net sales in Thailand are from products in scope for the scheme.\n\nIn Brazil, the front-of-pack legislation will take effect in October 2023.\n\nIn Mexico, the implementation of warning legends has started in October 2020.\n\nIn Peru, specialized nutrition products and foods and beverages without warning legends represent 35% of our sales.\n\nIn Chile, specialized nutrition products and foods and beverages without warning legends represent 37% of our sales.\nPerformance\nWe continue to make progress in each area of our approach.\n\nImproving the nutritional value of our products\nIn 2022, we reduced the sodium content in products, including our Mother Chicken Noodle Soup Fortified and Mother Seafood Creamy Soup. We will report measurable progress in line with our sodium reduction commitment in the future. Product innovation is helping us to reduce sugar in our products while still providing great taste. For example, our Coffee Mate brand in North America has expanded its zero-sugar range to eight varieties in the last year, and our Starbucks brand launched Starbucks Zero with 0g added sugars.\n\nIn the United States, our Lean Cuisine brand offers four frozen meals certified by the American Heart Association as meeting its standards for fat, sodium and cholesterol levels. While many factors affect heart disease, diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk.\n\nTo meet toddlers\u2019 unique nutritional needs, we introduced Gerber Powerblend cereal products and 99% of our cereal products aimed at kids made from locally sourced ingredients. Overall, 91% of our cereal products and 99% of our cereal products aimed at kids and teens have whole grains as the number one ingredient.\n\nIn the spring of 2022, the United States experienced a severe infant formula shortage following a recall of another manufacturer\u2019s products. We accelerated production and in May 2022 flew 500,000 bottle equivalents of Nestl\u00e9 Health Science\u2019s Affamin Infant and Affamin Junior and a million bottle equivalents of Gerber Good Start Extensive HA \u2013 all for babies with cow\u2019s milk protein allergies. This was followed by many more shipments of specialized and non-specialized Nestl\u00e9 infant formula, including NANN Supreme pro and Gerber Gentle.\n\nFor cats and dogs, we launched Purina Pro Plan supplements \u2013 in multiple formats such as oils, powders and tablets \u2013 to support mobility, immunity, vitality, healthy skin and coat.\n\nIn Brazil, Nestl\u00e9 launched two cereal bars co-created with young people in a S\u00e3o Paulo favela and NGO Gerando F\u00e1bulas.\n\nIn Pakistan, children are often iron deficient, which is why we launched Bunyad Iron+.\n\nIn Brazil, the Gerando F\u00e1bulas Fruit and Nut bar was launched as the first social product from Nestl\u00e9. All the profits were destined to help the lives of residents from more than four large favelas in Brazil, distributed in three regions: Maca\u00e9, Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo. To date, sales of the bar have generated nearly B$ 200,000 (over CHF 33,000) to help the organization improve lives in Brazil\u2019s Favelas.\n\nAffordable nutrition\nWe provided 211.4 billion servings of micronutrient fortified products from iconic brands such as Maggi, Bear Brand and Nido in 2022. This total includes 129.2 billion servings of affordable nutrition. New offerings included affordable, medium-fat milk powder launched in South Africa, which is enhanced with locally sourced ingredients containing calcium, iron, vitamins and zinc. In Pakistan, where one in two children are iron deficient, we launched Bunyad Iron+, an affordable dairy-based drink fortified with a new source of iron that is about three times better absorbed by the body compared with existing sources.\n\nIn Brazil, the Gerando F\u00e1bulas Fruit and Nut bar was launched as the first social product from Nestl\u00e9. All the profits were destined to help the lives of residents from more than four large favelas in Brazil, distributed in three regions: Maca\u00e9, Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo. To date, sales of the bar have generated nearly B$ 200,000 (over CHF 33,000) to help the organization improve lives in Brazil\u2019s Favelas.\n\nPlant-based products\nPlant-based products generated sales of around CHF 1 billion in 2022, posting high single-digit organic growth. Recent launches include soy-based Mills in Thailand, Nestl\u00e9 Veggie plant-based product with probiotics in Chile, Garden Gourmet Vole Gras \u2013 an alternative to foie gras \u2013 in Spain and Switzerland, and the Gerber Plant-tastic range of organic foods and snacks for toddlers in Europe and the United States.\n\nFollowing the 2021 launch of WUNDA Professional Barista, our foodservice division Nestl\u00e9 Professional expanded its boundaries and launched two new plant-based dairy alternative products in Greater China offering out-of-home operators the \u201cBy Barista For Barista\u201d oat and pea versions for hot and cold beverage applications. In Brazil and Chile, Nestl\u00e9 Professional launched the Barista Qart dairy alternative, as well as an innovative powdered plant-based creamer designed for our Nescaf\u00e9 automatic machines offer.\n\nOur plant-based strategy is not only about creating meat and dairy alternatives. The popular Maggi Veggie Masa\u00f1a Noodles have the same taste as the original but now include carrots and beans. Plus, Maggi offers recipes to cook delicious plant-based meals from scratch. Plant-based versions of Wagner Piccolinis provide vegan and vegetarian options.\n\nIn Latin America, under the Mother brand, we piloted a powdered, shelf-stable, plant-based protein blend to complement egg dishes in a nutritious and affordable way. When cooking scrambled eggs, omelets and batters, the soy-based Muevo M\u00e1s can replace some eggs, but with an equal amount of protein, fewer calories, less cholesterol and saturated fats.\nGuiding responsible consumption\nTo help people enjoy our products as part of a balanced diet, in 2022 we continued the rollout of The Backstory, our new on-pack communication system. The Backstory allows our brands to tell purpose-driven stories on the back of our packs while better organizing all required product information, ensuring transparent nutritional information and providing portion guidance.\n\nWe also continued to roll out our digital services. These include MyMenuplan, where users can create and share balanced meals and shop for ingredients. New available via 23 websites in different countries, new functionality in 2022 included personal nutritional statistics such as macronutrient and micronutrient intakes. In addition, MyMenuIQ is now available via 30 websites and measures the nutritional balance of a meal on a scale from 0 to 100 to help people combine foods for nutritional balance. Finally, five markets have introduced chatbots to help people find a recipe to use up ingredients they already have.\n\nResponsible marketing\nIn 2022, we announced plans to update our Marketing Communication to Children Policy with a commitment not to market confectionery, ice cream or water-based beverages with added sugars to children below 16 years of age, becoming one of the first in the industry to adopt such strict standards. There were no material sanctions over CHF 10 million due to products\u2019 labeling or marketing violations. We identified 116 cases of non-compliance with our breast-milk substitute marketing code in 2022. By January 2023, we had implemented and published our updated policy on the responsible marketing of breast-milk substitutes in a commitment to unilaterally stop the promotion of infant formula globally for babies aged 0-6 months.\n\nCompliance with the Nestl\u00e9 Marketing Communication to Children Policy*\n\n| Channel | 2021 | 2022 |\n|---------|------|------|\n| TV      | 98.7%| 98.4%|\n| Websites| 100% | 100% |\n| Social media | 81.4% | 100% |\n| Influencers** | 100% | 37.5% |\n| Total   | 95.5%| 83.9% |\n\nEngaging the culinary profession\nNestl\u00e9 Professional continued to support various training and awareness initiatives. Together with the Culinary Arts Academy Switzerland, Nestl\u00e9 Professional ran a masterclass for a Culinary Business Management masters degree program on nutrition, plant-based, and sustainability topics.\n\nNestl\u00e9 for Healthier Kids\nActivities in 2022 included the Nestl\u00e9 Wellness Campus (NWC), our 10-year flagship school program in the Philippines, run in collaboration with the Philippine Department of Education. NWC continued to empower students, parents and teachers to live healthier lives throughout the COVID-19 pandemic using online learning modules. New topics introduced in 2022 in addition to nutrition included sustainability and waste management. NWC now reaches more than 10.5 million students in over 20,000 schools.\n\nIn Hungary, after a successful pilot, we launched a nationwide educational challenge called Etelad az \u00c9telez (Feed your brain), in cooperation with Okos Doboz (Smart Box), the largest Hungarian digital education platform. The campaign is aimed at increasing children\u2019s knowledge of healthy lifestyles, nutrition and sustainability. Since the project\u2019s inception, children have solved more than 127,000 tasks.\n\nNestl\u00e9 Professional and Worldchefs inspire children to eat healthier. Through a series of events, around 3800 chefs and influencers in 2022 focused on the impact food production and consumption has on the environment. This year\u2019s theme \u2013 Growing a Healthy Future \u2013 reached over 95,600 children.\n\nAs part of Nestl\u00e9 for Healthier Kids, our Nutriplate initiative has been helping to bring a balanced diet within reach for thousands of people in several European countries, including France, Italy, Romania and Spain, as well as in Latin America for five years.\n\nThe objective is to help families to eat well and teach their children good nutritional habits by creating tasty, balanced and varied meals with portion sizes adapted to the age of their children. The principle is that meals should contain a large portion of vegetables, a protein-rich food (meat, eggs, fish, lentils or beans) and a portion of either wholegrain pasta, brown rice or potatoes. The Nutriplate kit helps people to visualize how much food from each of these food groups they should aim to eat. It consists of a plate illustrated to show the space each food group should take up and a booklet containing science-based nutritional guidance and seasonal recipes that are quick and easy to prepare.\n\nResults from a survey in Spain in March 2022 showed that in that country:\n- 94% of participants rate Nutriplate as a good or very good approach\n- 92% of participants said that they had changed their nutritional habits thanks to Nutriplate\n\nAround 6000 healthcare professionals are using Nutriplate to guide their patients.\n\nAs a complement to Nutriplate, in 2022, our South-East European Market launched the VeggiePlate, to help people make the switch to a balanced plant-based diet. Developed with scientific support from the Romanian Foundation for Healthy Eating, the VeggiePlate uses the same principle of visualising the space that different plant-based foods should take up on the plate.\n\nA six-month campaign promoting the initiative included a social media challenge for people to eat plant-based foods on #3outof7 days, plus a tasting event, expert interviews, a video and two conferences attended by 1800 healthcare professionals. The campaign garnered great coverage, with 83 separate independent items about VeggiePlate published online, in print or in broadcast media, reaching around three million people in a week.\n\nOriginally launched in Romania, the campaign is now also active in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia and Serbia. To be more inclusive, both Nutriplate and VeggiePlate nutritional guides are available in Braille alphabet and audio versions in Romania, and as of 2023 also in Bulgaria, to increase access for people with visual impairments.\n\nUsing the plate itself as a guide, VeggiePlate indicates the proportion of vegetables and healthy protein-rich foods and carbohydrates to adults and families in a fun, actionable way.\n\nOutlook\nWe will continue our efforts to contribute to tasty and balanced diets. Our evolved nutrient profiling system will guide us for innovations and help us to further improve our products through adding more wholegrain, fiber and micronutrients, while reducing sugars, sodium and saturated fats. We will also continue to address the varying needs across life stages while keeping our focus on affordable nutrition. To support the responsible consumption of treats, we will strengthen our efforts on providing portion guidance and complementary nutrition information on pack and through our services. For continued transparency we will continue to communicate the nutritional value across the portfolio globally and for a range of countries.\n\n31 Countries with breast-milk substitute compliance audits (24 in 2021)\nSafe, high-quality products are at the heart of our purpose to unlock the power of food to enhance quality of life for everyone.\n\nFood safety and quality\n\nBackground\n\nHigh standards of food safety and quality are non-negotiable at Nestl\u00e9. Quality is integral to our Corporate Business Principles and embedded in our purpose and values.\n\nApproach\n\nWe take care of food safety and quality from field to consumer homes. We apply international standards in food safety and quality management and help raise the bar in our industry using rigorous processes and leading scientific techniques. We empower our people to ensure our products are safe and compliant, enjoyable and nutritious, and in tune with consumer expectations. Our internal safety and quality processes help us anticipate and respond to any challenges.\n\nThe many factors our food safety and quality systems must respond to include tightening regulation, changes to suppliers or ingredients due to factors such as extreme weather events and geopolitical developments, the introduction of regenerative agriculture practices and new packaging materials or systems, and portfolio innovations such as plant-based products.\n\nWe follow international guidelines in relation to risk management, carefully checking incoming materials, processes and products in our factories. With more than 850 experts dedicated to specialized analytical testing in 20 industry-leading laboratories worldwide, we perform more than four million tests a year. And we don\u2019t stop there \u2013 we work hard to embed a strong food safety culture throughout our business, where quality is everyone\u2019s responsibility.\n\nNestl\u00e9 experts participate in leading industry forums, including the Steering Committee and the Stakeholder Advisory Forum of the Global Food Safety Initiative and the FSSC Advisory Committee.\n\nInnovations\n\nFood safety and quality at Nestl\u00e9 are fueled by science and technology and our expertise at the Nestl\u00e9 Institute of Food Safety and Analytical Sciences. Digital solutions are helping us to strengthen key processes, while research and data analytics can help close gaps in scientific knowledge. In 2022, Nestl\u00e9 published more than 60 papers on analytical sciences, food safety research, digital food safety and bioanalytics.\n\nThe analytical capabilities of our laboratories enable us to focus on detecting priority materials such as mineral oils, microplastics, plant toxins and pesticides. In 2022, Nestl\u00e9 markets, laboratories and quality experts received external recognition from numerous national and international award schemes.\n\nFocused on progress\n\nBy the end of 2022, all inspections and quality control activities in our manufacturing process were digitized, improving our ability to prevent defects. We now use predictive analytics to assess quality risks related to suppliers and incoming raw materials, and to provide early warning of potential problems. Beyond our suppliers, we support external initiatives to build food safety capabilities globally.\n\nIf an incident occurs, we take immediate steps to address it to prevent repeat occurrences, including a thorough analysis to identify root causes. The most significant example in 2022 related to the tragic outbreak of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) in France and a potential link to Buitoni Fraich\u2019Up pizza. We immediately conducted a voluntary recall of all Fraich\u2019Up pizzas, suspended production, and rolled out an extensive information campaign aimed at consumers and our customers. Naturally, we fully cooperated with the authorities to understand the origin of the contamination. Our deepest sympathies are with the people affected.\n\nIn 2022, 98% of our manufacturing and R&D sites were certified to a GFSI-recognized food safety certification program (2021: 95%).\n\nIn 2022, 91.9% of our manufacturing and R&D sites were certified to a GFSI-recognized food safety certification program (2021: 88%).\n\nGFSI audits in our facilities\n\n| Year | Major non-conformance rate |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| 2021 | 2.85                      |\n| 2022 | 2.77                      |\n\n| Year | Minor non-conformance rate |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| 2021 | 4.25                      |\n| 2022 | 3.94                      |\n\n| Year | Corrective action rate |\n|------|------------------------|\n| 2021 | 1.56                   |\n| 2022 | 1.52                   |\n\nOutlook\n\nWe will continue to reinforce our quality and food safety culture across the organization, working to continue strengthening competences, perform more frequent and targeted testing, enhance verification, stay alert to the latest research findings in critical risk areas and adapt our protocols as appropriate, and to make better use of data to predict and detect potential incidents.\nPackaging and circularity\n\nPackaging waste management is an area of major concern for society. We are working toward a future where none of our packaging ends up in landfill or as litter in the environment.\n\nBackground\nPackaging helps protect food and beverages, ensure product quality and safety, and prevent food waste. It can also provide important information, such as the origins of ingredients and nutritional content.\n\nGlobally, the amount of packaging that is inappropriately created or managed at the end of its life is a serious and persistent environmental problem. Inappropriate waste management can also create hazardous conditions for people. Reducing packaging waste, increasing reusability and recyclability, and managing recovered materials effectively is therefore critical for society.\n\nThe infrastructure to collect, sort and reuse or recycle packaging varies not only by country but also by municipality. While packaging recycling schemes in a few countries have helped to start a circular economy for recovered materials, many regions are not yet at this stage.\n\nBy year-end 2022, we saw Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) laws on packaging active in more than 70 national and local jurisdictions, with an additional 40 laws currently discussing draft legislation on the topic. These laws, if well designed, could help develop the necessary infrastructure to collect, sort and recycle packaging materials.\n\nWith other consumer goods companies, we are making the sustainable transformation of our packaging an urgent priority. Improving packaging design, production processes, reuse and recycling rates and end-of-life management can therefore make a notable impact on our efforts to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Packaging is essential to us and with innovation we are working to minimize the related environmental impacts.\n\nTable of contents\nCreating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2022 43\nApproach\n\nOur vision is ambitious: a world in which none of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s packaging, including plastics, ends up in landfill or as litter.\n\nWe are part of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation\u2019s New Plastics Economy \u2013 an initiative that mobilized the first voluntary industry action in 2017 \u2013 and we have pledged to work as an industry to create a circular economy for plastic. The first steps are the elimination of unnecessary and problematic plastic in our packaging. We are also aiming to reduce virgin plastics by one third and to design above 95% of our plastic packaging for recycling by 2025.\n\nAs a signatory of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Global Commitment, we now aim to design above 95% of our packaging for acceptance in recycling systems by 2025. We remain committed to getting to 100%. The Commitment\u2019s success depends not only on our product design, but also on the development of infrastructure for collection, sorting and reuse and recycling around the world, particularly for flexible plastics. Governments have made strong progress in waste management infrastructure development, but the scale does not yet match the need. This is why we have restated our commitment in terms that we can directly impact \u2013 design for recycling systems and virgin plastics reductions.\n\nOur intention is to follow the nine Golden Design Rules of the Consumer Goods Forum\u2019s Plastic Waste Coalition of Action \u2013 voluntary, independent and time-bound commitments to which all members are aligned in order to move toward a circular model. One of these rules is to \u201cremove problematic elements from packaging\u201d. We have identified several plastic types (including polystyrene) that are unlikely to be included in municipal recycling systems around the world and are phasing out this \u201cnegative list\u201d of materials from our packaging portfolio.\n\nOUR PILLARS\n\nWe have five pillars of activity:\n\nPillar 1: Less packaging \u2013 Reduce\nReducing our use of virgin plastics packaging material, removing unnecessary plastics and increasing recycled content.\n\nPillar 2: Less packaging \u2013 Reuse and refill\nScaling reusable packaging and aligned bulk dispensing systems to eliminate the need for disposable packaging.\n\nPillar 3: Better packaging \u2013 Redesign\nPioneering alternative materials, novel technologies and innovative packaging solutions to facilitate reuse and recycling.\n\nPillar 4: Better System \u2013 Recycle\nSupporting collection, sorting, reuse and recycling infrastructure to shape a waste-free future.\n\nPillar 5: Better system \u2013 Rethinking behaviors\nRethinking mindsets and behaviors at Nestl\u00e9, with retail partners and consumers.\n\nPackaging sustainability innovation\n\nPackaging innovation takes on many forms and is a cornerstone to deliver Nestl\u00e9\u2019s packaging sustainability vision. While every innovation in packaging may be unique, they are all required to deliver a balance between performance, cost and environmental impact, while ensuring the safety and quality of the products they protect.\n\nOur culture of innovation has been recognized for example by Fast Company, which named Nestl\u00e9 USA among the Best Workplaces for Innovators in Sustainability for our expanded sustainability efforts in recent years and the creation of new recyclable packaging.\n\nWith our global reach of 23 R&D centers and the Nestl\u00e9 Institute of Packaging Sciences, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s R&D packaging, engineering and material scientists are closely collaborating with suppliers, start-ups and universities to accelerate innovation across all packaging types and materials.\n\nThe importance of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s membership of the Consumer Goods Forum.\n\nWe all know there is a problem with plastic waste. The scale of the issue globally, the impact it is having on marine life, its carbon footprint and the long-term build up of microplastics in the environment all mean that we have to act.\n\nAs with many sustainability challenges, no single actor can solve the problem alone. The plastic problem is too systemic. However, the consumer goods sector is in a position to deliver impactful industry-led solutions \u2013 and it must do so.\n\nThis is why at the Consumer Goods Forum, we are committed to engaging in specific efforts to use less and better plastic, and to helping create a better system for managing plastic.\n\nSince 2018, we have endorsed the Ellen MacArthur Foundation\u2019s vision for a new plastics economy and have been working to share knowledge and create partnerships with multi-national companies such as Nestl\u00e9.\n\nAction on plastic waste\n\nTo date, 40 retailers, consumer brands and packaging converters in the Consumer Goods Forum\u2019s Plastic Waste Coalition of Action have worked with industry experts, recyclers and plastics associations from over 25 countries to develop the Golden Design Rules for plastic packaging. Thirty-three leading multi-national companies \u2013 including Nestl\u00e9 \u2013 have now signed up to implement one or more of these rules across their plastic packaging portfolios by 2025. These rules are a set of voluntary, independent and time-bound commitments that aim to minimize waste, streamline designs and simplify the plastic recycling process \u2013 ultimately increasing recycling.\n\nCollectively, we are seeking to leverage the power of coalition members from around the world who represent a shared revenue of more than one trillion euros and more than 10% of the global plastic packaging market.\n\nExternal viewpoint\n\nA coalition to close the loop\n\nIgnacio Gavilan\nDirector Sustainability, Consumer Goods Forum\n\nImproved packaging design can minimize plastic waste and improve recycling rates.\nNestl\u00e9 is one of several brands that significantly reduced its use of plastic in 2022, through product redesigns and compostable pods.\n\n**Performance**\n\nNestl\u00e9 is transforming its packaging systems \u2013 moving beyond peak virgin plastic while our business continues to grow. Virgin plastic in our packaging has reduced by 10.5% since 2018 (adjusted baseline). At year-end 2022, 81.9% of our plastic packaging was designed for recycling.\n\nSeveral factors have affected the percentage of plastic types used in our packaging by weight (see table), including acquisitions and divestments, packaging reduction initiatives, a shift toward paper packaging, product mix changes and data quality improvements. These factors impacted both the quantities and recyclability of our plastic packaging mix.\n\nOf our total packaging, 85.8% by weight was recyclable or reusable in 2022, based on the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Global Commitment reporting rules, and 36.0% was made from renewable materials.\n\nThe above factors, combined with our progress in reducing, reusing, and redesigning packaging for individual products, resulted in a decrease in the weight of packaging put on the market to 3.6 million tonnes (2021: 3.8 million tonnes) and in the number of packaging pieces placed on the market to 330 billion (2021: 344 billion)**.\n\nIn 2022, we advocated for a legally binding UN Treaty on Plastic Pollution. We supported the launch of a collective advocacy group, the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty, which we advocated for as a well-designed Extended Producer Responsibility legislation and helped public authorities and stakeholders improve infrastructure with 215 activities and projects around the world. A selection of projects from across our five action pillars are described on the right.\n\n**Pillar 1: Less packaging \u2013 Reduce**\n\nIn 2022, Nescaf\u00e9 Dolce Gusto unveiled new capsules that will save more than 2500 tonnes of polypropylene thanks to a 13% plastic weight reduction in the capsules. In Vietnam, Nescaf\u00e9 reduced the thickness of the laminate in its Granules Sachets sticks \u2013 saving 144 tonnes of plastic annually (the equivalent of 8 million plastic toothbrushes).\n\nNestl\u00e9 Waters, in France, achieved more than 1500 tonnes of plastic reductions following a multi-year weight optimization program for PET bottles that started in 2018. Similarly, in Mexico, Nestl\u00e9 Waters reduced the weight of its 500 ml and 4L PET bottles and the gauge of polyethylene shrink film, resulting in a 766-tonne saving of plastic per year.\n\nNestl\u00e9 Waters also continued to increase the recycled content in PET bottles globally. In Egypt, they launched their first rPET-containing bottles, supporting the development of a circular packaging system where bottles are collected and recycled, \u201cbottle-to-bottle\u201d. In the UK, Nestl\u00e9 Waters also moved the entire Buxton Natural Mineral Water range to 100% rPET.\n\n**Pillar 2: Less packaging \u2013 Reuse and refill**\n\nIn France, we launched a pilot with Carrefour, testing new refillable solutions for Nescaf\u00e9, confectionery and pet food products in two stores. Also in France, we offered products in Loop reusable packaging in Carrefour for our brands Nesquik, Reoore and Chocapic.\n\nLaunched in 2019 and now available in more than 40 countries, ALDO\u2122 to make it perfect for Nescaf\u00e9, Milo and Coffee Mate individual dosing in out-of-home channels, reducing packaging waste in more than 16 500 locations.\n\n**Pillar 3: Better packaging \u2013 Redesign**\n\nIn Latin America, we replaced our printed polystyrene tubes with designed-for-recycling polypropylene tubes for our ice cream. In Brazil, our Musslen brand pouches have been converted to mono material. This shift delivered more than 44% CO2e reductions versus the previous film structure. We also replaced the plastic- and aluminum-layered packaging of Nesquik with grease-resistant coated paper.\n\nIn France, starting in 2021, we began changing the wrappers of organic Maggi bouillon cubes from a multi-layer laminate that included aluminum to recyclable and sustainably sourced paper.\n\n**Pillar 4: Better System \u2013 Recycle**\n\nIn Malaysia, Nestl\u00e9 joined forces with Petaling Jaya City to launch a door-to-door collection and recycling program as a voluntary recovery initiative. As of 2022, we have successfully collected over 6400 tonnes of post-consumer packaging waste, of which nearly 4072 tonnes have been plastic. This pioneering program has been recognized by both the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the Ministry of Environment Malaysia as an example of separation-at-source good practice.\n\nIn Brazil, Nestl\u00e9 is collaborating with the non-profit organization Reciclerios, implementing integrated waste collection models with local cooperatives. In 2022, the collaboration extended waste collection into additional states including Piracicaba. With 27 617 inhabitants, Piracicaba had no selective collection infrastructure in place. The collaboration aims help curb plastic waste leakage and increase recycling.\n\nIn Fife, Scotland, Nestl\u00e9 UK & Ireland partnered with Yes Recycling to process hard-to-recycle plastics. Nestl\u00e9 \u2013 Yes Recycling\u2019s first investor \u2013 has invested GBP 1.65 million (CHF 1.88 million) toward the site, which started operating at the end of 2022 and aims to offer a 15 000-tonnes capacity in the production of an alternative to plywood for the construction, retail and agriculture industries.\n\n**Pillar 5: Better system \u2013 Rethinking behaviors**\n\nIn Europe, Nespresso extended its RELOVE pilot scheme in 2022, allowing customers to return their coffee machines to a repair center where they are carefully refurbished and presented as real goods. Refurbished machines were already available in Canada and Switzerland, before RELOVE was launched in 2021 across Austria, France and the United States. In 2022, the scheme was expanded to Denmark, Italy, Portugal, Romania and Sweden.\n\nIn Italy, Nestl\u00e9 introduced a digital platform, Dove Lo Butto, to help consumers identify the nearest location to dispose of their packaging waste appropriately. This is an innovative digital platform characterized by two functions: barcode scanning for correct waste disposal and geo-localization that links to the rules on waste management of each municipality. In Italy today, every municipality has different rules for waste disposal because of the various technical and operational requirements that the local municipal companies must comply with.\n\nIn Germany and Mexico, Nescaf\u00e9 Dolce Gusto launched a consumer education campaign to promote recycling. In the United Kingdom, Buxton Natural Mineral Water launched a communications campaign to raise awareness of its closed-loop water bottle to bottle recycling.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\nCreating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2022 45\n\n| Percentage of global plastic used in our packaging by weight and type (% of total) |\n| --- |\n| Material | 2021 | 2022 |\n| PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) | 22.1% | 34.8% |\n| PE (Polyethylene) | 16.5% | 19.5% |\n| PP (Polypropylene) | 15.0% | 21.6% |\n| PO (Polyolefin) | 1.4% | 6.0% |\n| Laminates | 24.1% | 17.2% |\n| Others | 0.9% | 0.7% |\n\n**Percentage of packaging made from recycled and/or renewable materials**\n\n36.0% (39.5% in 2021)\n\n**Total weight of packaging (million tonnes)**\n\n| 2021 | 2022 |\n| --- | --- |\n| Total weight of packaging (million tonnes) | 4.5 | 3.8 |\n| Total weight of plastic packaging in million tonnes | 3.8 | 3.6 |\n\n**Sustainability Accounting Standards Board Process Fruits Standard FR-FF-47a.1**\n\n* As per Ellen MacArthur Foundation definitions.\n\n** Replaced due to acquisitions, divestments and packaging changes.\nOutlook\n\nWe are continuing to transform our packaging systems. By reducing unnecessary packaging, designing better packaging, modeling collection systems and supporting better regulation, we aim to support the packaging system transition to deliver no waste in landfills or nature.\n\nTo this end, we are clarifying our commitment with a focus on what we can directly impact \u2013 reducing the use of virgin plastics, designing out unnecessary and problematic packaging and designing for reuse and recycling systems. Strong progress has been made in taking voluntary actions under our control, but the development of key infrastructure does not yet match the need.\n\nWe know there is more work ahead in the shift from voluntary action to mandatory legislation, enabling a fair distribution of responsibility across the value chain. Because the road ahead will be shaped by more than voluntary commitments \u2013 a shift which might see a UN Treaty on Plastic Pollution transform the plastics system from voluntary to harmonized and mandatory legislative frameworks after 2025.\n\nFair circularity\n\nHow Nestl\u00e9 is promoting human rights in the informal waste sector.\n\nWaste pickers work in the informal waste sector, some independently and others within organized associations or cooperatives. In many countries, these workers play a substantial and valuable role in the collection, sorting and recycling of packaging waste and other materials.\n\nAt the same time, they are vulnerable to a broad range of serious human rights impacts \u2013 meaning that even as recycling delivers positive environmental impacts, it requires human rights due diligence from companies involved in plastics waste or recycling value chains. As we work to end plastic pollution, we must also drive toward an inclusive circular economy for plastics.\n\nAs part of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s pledge to operationalize the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights \u2013 the global standard for how businesses should ensure respect for human rights \u2013 we made the recognition of the human rights of informal sector waste workers a priority. As a business, we had been taking steps to address social impacts in the waste sector, but we recognized the need for a cross-value-chain collaborative approach with partners to tackle these impacts effectively.\n\nThe process was convened by the civil society organization Tearfund and the Global Alliance of Waste Pickers and Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO). It was facilitated by the non-profit human rights expert consultancy Shift and further informed by the perspective of informal waste workers. The founding company members include Nestl\u00e9, the Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo and Unilever. The collaboration developed a set of principles to enable the future implementation respecting the human rights of workers in the informal waste sector for companies.\n\nThe Fair Circularity Initiative aims to bring businesses together around these ten principles with the aim of ensuring that the human rights of workers within the informal waste sector are respected and their role in circular value chains is recognized. These principles apply the expectations and responsibilities outlined in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights specifically to the informal waste sector.\n\nThe initiative members started joint advocacy for the inclusion of waste pickers and recognition of their human rights in the scope of the UN Treaty on Plastic Pollution in March 2022 at the United Nations Environment Assembly. Our collective efforts successfully managed to integrate a specific reference to waste pickers\u2019 rights and interests in the resolution of the legally binding UN Treaty on Plastics in 2022.\n\nThe initiative was formally launched in November 2022, after over a year of interviews and workshops with key stakeholders. Looking forward, it will see us advance by adopting these guiding principles in our value chains, reporting annually on our progress, and encouraging other companies to join the initiative and do the same.\n\nNestl\u00e9 supports Pastimber, a Colombian start-up, led by waste pickers. It transforms collected plastic into boards for the construction industry \u2013 replacing wood.\n\nA Nestl\u00e9 team visits the CRER Cooperative in Montevideo, Uruguay. CRER fills an infrastructure gap, providing vital waste sorting in the community before sending materials to recycling plants.\n\nThese principles acknowledge the crucial role waste pickers play in global recycling. They are an invitation to work together to ensure these workers are recognized as legitimate stakeholders, and their rights are respected \u2013 from living income, safe working conditions, enabling them to have a voice in their futures.\n\nTable of contents\n\nCreating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2022 46\nOpportunities for young people\n\nProviding jobs for young people, investing in youth employability and empowering young entrepreneurs helps us recruit talent and embed sustainable and regenerative approaches around the world.\n\nBackground\n\nYoung people bring fresh ideas and energy to the workplace. They are a crucial part of any company\u2019s long-term talent pipeline. Yet, globally, some 73 million young people were either unemployed in 2022 (six million more than pre-pandemic levels) or had a job that kept them in poverty.\n\nFacilitating youth employment by creating decent and exciting job opportunities is important. It supports respect for human rights, specifically the right to work, with \u2018just and favorable conditions of work and protection against unemployment\u2019, as set out by the United Nations.\n\nUpskilling young people internally, in our supply chains and in society in general, is good for us as an organization, for individuals and for communities. As a major employer, we can make a positive difference by providing employment as well as digital and physical training and skills development opportunities.\n\nSupporting young people also brings more diverse perspectives into our supply chain. Nowhere is that more relevant than in farming: with young people moving to cities, the average age of farmers in many parts of the world is now well into the 50s.\n\nEncouraging and supporting young people to pursue livelihoods in farming is an opportunity to help embed regenerative agriculture methods from the very start of working lives and lay the foundations for more regenerative food systems in the future.\n\nSDG CONTRIBUTIONS\n\n5121 Young farmers trained through the Nestl\u00e9 Agripreneurship Program (7422 in 2021)\n11 495 Apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities (11 598 in 2021)\n26 610 Nestl\u00e9 employees hired under 30 years old, unlimited and temporary contracts\n64 977 Young entrepreneurs who have received some basic but tangible benefit from Nestl\u00e9\n1 415 687 Young people impacted through digital events (e.g. career fairs, educational webinars, e-learning programs) that focus on upskilling young people and make them more employable (1 291 306 in 2021)\n\n* Delivered specifically through Nestl\u00e9 needs 70th initiative.\nApproach\n\nThrough our Nestl\u00e9 needs YOUTH initiative we create opportunities for young people. Our initiative has three pillars of activity \u2013 Employability, Agripreneurship and Entrepreneurship. At Nestl\u00e9, we are committed to helping 10 million young people gain access to economic opportunities by 2030.\n\nUnder each of the three pillars, we provide access to diverse opportunities. We motivate young people to help them prepare for and access the world of work, by providing online training, content and on-the-job training opportunities to enhance their employability. We encourage them to become agripreneurs \u2013 introducing them to regenerative agriculture techniques and teaching them business skills. And we promote entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial opportunities through our Youth Entrepreneurship Platform.\n\nAdditionally, Nestl\u00e9 is an active advocate for young people. In this context we collaborate with external organizations, including the International Labor Organization, the Global Apprenticeship Network and the Global Alliance for YOUTH.\n\nThe Global Alliance for YOUTH, co-founded by Nestl\u00e9, is a business-driven movement of like-minded organizations passionate about working together to help young people around the globe get the necessary skills to thrive in the world of work, today and tomorrow.\n\nWe are convinced that by mobilizing the business community through the Global Alliance, we can help young people on a larger scale and have a bigger impact than we can individually.\n\nGlobal Alliance members offer youth first-job experiences, run educational programs to enhance young people\u2019s skills and support young entrepreneurs.\n\nWith millions of people displaced from Ukraine, Nestl\u00e9 has been helping get young people\u2019s careers back on track.\n\nIn 2022, soon after the invasion of Ukraine began, we discussed with the YOUTH Steering Committee how we could further support young Ukrainians \u2013 particularly those who had to flee their country or had their studies curtailed. We all agreed that we wanted to help not just with product donations, but by offering young Ukrainians purpose and opportunity.\n\nI\u2019ve worked at Nestl\u00e9 for 26 years, partly because there is a spirit that anything is possible. That incredible idea quickly grew into an internship program. Initially, the plan was to support young Ukrainian refugees, but eventually, the scope expanded to allow students \u2013 even those still in Ukraine \u2013 to participate as well.\n\nMarkets, functions and human resources teams were keen to help and together we managed to secure 34 internships across 22 countries in Europe and Latin America, in addition to the existing Westernship program. To make sure these placements were attractive to young people with different backgrounds and experience levels, we opened positions in Finance and Control, Key Account Management, Confectionery, Marketing, Procurement, Supply Chain, Project Management and the Digital Transformation team.\n\nSuccess and limitations\n\nSince May, we\u2019ve processed 61 applicants, made seven firm offers for employment to date and I have had the pleasure of seeing two interns start work in Switzerland and France. We would have moved faster except for two constraints. First, it was difficult for our Human Resources team in Ukraine to access candidates. Power outages, building damage and shelling are a daily reality that hampered communication with universities to set up the program. Secondly, there was red tape surrounding work permits.\n\nLuckily, the European Commission stepped in to make permits easier and while local teams remained engaged and resilient. I remember speaking to the Ukrainian Head of Talent in May. She was driving from one place to another for three hours, looking for a safe place to stay. The whole time she was taking calls on her mobile. Another colleague had already fled to Poland and was working from there.\n\nThe bravery of our colleagues\n\nThe ability and willingness of Ukrainians to help, even though their own lives were in danger, is frankly remarkable. With their help, we were able to reach out to young people by advertising in Ukrainian. We posted on LinkedIn and made a short video that reached 99,000 impressions, with 4500 people commenting and engaging.\n\nOne of the reasons why this was possible is that students in Ukraine have access to excellent universities and education systems. The interns we are interviewing have acquired diverse skills and speak multiple languages \u2013 advantages that help them fit in immediately at Nestl\u00e9. The feedback about those who have started is overwhelmingly positive, with their outstanding teamwork and immediate ability to connect being noted.\n\nI think I\u2019m most proud of the solidarity. What started as an idea has become a practical platform to empower young Ukrainians. We chose to offer internships over jobs to ensure everyone has the flexibility they need (for example to return home). And we have no plans to stop our program: more interns started in January 2023 and Nestl\u00e9 will ensure everyone has the flexibility they need (for example to return home). And we have no plans to stop our program: more interns started in January 2023 and Nestl\u00e9 will continue to recruit and place young people for as long as Ukrainian students need the extra support.\n\nTable of contents\n\nCreating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2022 48\nPerformance\n\nWe remain on track to help 10 million young people gain access to economic opportunities by 2030. In 2022, we succeeded in creating 1.73 million opportunities through the Nestl\u00e9 needs YOUth initiative, taking the cumulative total since announcing our commitment in 2017 to 5.62 million.\n\nAt the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP27, in November, Nestl\u00e9 demonstrated how the youth agenda contributes to the company\u2019s values and wider commitments in a workshop on building responsible communications.\n\nIn May 2022, as a member of the Global Alliance for YOUth, Nestl\u00e9 partnered with NielsenIQ and the Global Shares Community to launch the Global Youth Survey and discuss its initial findings during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The survey, focusing on post-COVID-19 young consumer pain points, captured the views of nearly 2000 people aged between 18 and 29, from 19 countries. The survey focused on four areas of action: inclusive jobs, sustainability, digital access and mental health. The full survey results are available here.\n\nAgripreneurship\n\nThrough our longstanding Agripreneurship Program we have engaged 74,077 agripreneurs, including 25,176 under 30, who are training to become future-fit farmers. In daily alone, we have trained 17,438 young farmers through our basic support program (2018-2021).\n\nAdditionally, our brands continue to bring agripreneurship into their own sustainability plans. For example, the Nescaf\u00e9 Plan 2030 will continue to include an agripreneurship component, continuing and enhancing the activities of the previous decade.\n\nEntrepreneurship\n\nIn August 2022, to consolidate our progress in this area, we launched the Youth Entrepreneurship Platform (YEP) \u2013 a digital home that groups all our innovation activities and programs in one place (see case study Harnessing the power of young entrepreneurs). In just over a month, we had over 11,000 website visitors, with over 5000 young people registering accounts.\n\nIn 2022, 174,000 learning, training or job opportunities were created for European youth. In the United States, Nespresso has been working with Thrive Scholars, a non-profit, to develop leaders \u2013 particularly from black and Latin backgrounds. In 2022, 20 scholars were sponsored with the program (see external viewpoint Inspiring high-potential students to thrive in modern workplaces).\n\n35 million\n\nTraining opportunities have been provided by the Global Alliance for YOUth members since its launch in 2019.\n\nThrough Nestl\u00e9 Needs YOUth \u2013 our initiative in the United States focused on empowering the next generation to thrive \u2013 we partnered with non-profit Girls With Impact to inspire future female business leaders to pursue their innovative ideas. We awarded 150 scholarships to Girls With Impact\u2019s Business and Leadership Academy in 2022, and hosted a \u201cBig Ideas, Better World\u201d competition for women aged 12-29 to submit their business ideas that could help solve pressing challenges in the food and beverage industry. The winning participant received funds from Nestl\u00e9 to put toward her start-up, as well as mentorship from our R&D Accelerator team in the United States.\n\nEmployment and employability\n\nOur approach to introducing young people to skills for thriving in modern workplaces is also progressing. In June 2022, Nestl\u00e9 convened the first Nestl\u00e9 YOUth e-Fest, a two-day online event in all 13 Africa, Oceania and Asia markets. Some 19 masterclasses were designed to help upskill today\u2019s youth for the workplace, with 20 speakers from Google, Microsoft and TikTok joining representatives from KitKat, Nescaf\u00e9 and Milo to talk on topics including brand building and content creation. More than 33,000 participants attended, generating social media reach of 7 million with engagement of 234,000 (only the 33,000 attendees count toward our key performance indicator). Attendees said the event provided good information about career opportunities within Nestl\u00e9.\n\nDigital events emulate an approach pioneered in Pacific Alliance countries \u2013 Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Peru. These virtual and face-to-face youth forums (The Pacific Alliance Youth Summit) are now in their seventh year and involve the participation and support from the respective governments, the private sector and non-for-profit organizations such as UNESCO and the International Labor Organization. The event in 2022 was hosted in Mexico in October and attracted the interest of more than 300,000 young people.\n\nA virtual event run by Nestl\u00e9 Conecta in the Plata region (Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay) in October 2022, offering digital and innovation skills, attracted 75,000 unique users. In February 2022, Nestl\u00e9 Brazil in partnership with the Brazilian Alliance for YOUth and MOVER, a movement for racial equity, hosted Nestl\u00e9 Conecta, an event aimed at connecting and engaging with young people to provide training and employability opportunities. This event attracted more than 40,000 young people.\n\nIn China, Nestl\u00e9 has worked with Tsinghua University and Imperial College London to explain and discuss our sustainability strategy with thousands of students to help give them practical insights. In Ecuador, 2800 young people received career guidance and vocational training as part of Nestl\u00e9 Ecuador\u2019s \u2018dual training\u2019 model, which helps young people to both expand their skills and leverage employment opportunities.\n\nOur brands have also taken these activities to heart, such as the J. Polloigino Young Chef Academy. This brings young chefs together with influential members of the gastronomic world to help develop skills and knowledge, build networks and offer mentorship.\n\nIn 2018, Nestl\u00e9 Professional and Worldchefs launched Worldchefs Academy, a free online training course for aspiring chefs to take a first step toward a culinary career. Over 41,000 students have enrolled since the launch; in 2022, the number of graduates reached 2365.\n\nIn 2022, with our partner Worldchefs, we delivered a series of three webinars that were available free of charge to people interested in the out-of-home industry. Participants of the webinars have tangible proof of their learning through a digital badge and certificate that they can add to their CVs or LinkedIn Profiles. In 2022, over 1000 digital badges were issued.\n\nAs part of the Nestl\u00e9 needs YOUth initiative, the Nestl\u00e9 Professional YOUth Culinary Talents Program continues to support future chefs by strengthening their theoretical and practical culinary skills and preparing them for a career in foodservice, which is suffering from a shortage of skilled workers worldwide.\nOutlook\nWe will continue to advocate for young people at all levels \u2013 from local communities through to governments and international organizations.\n\nLooking ahead, we will also continue to promote and improve our new Youth Entrepreneurship Platform and accelerate our efforts to bring young farmers together. We will seek to create engaging, relevant, content to encourage organic growth and widen knowledge about the support we can provide entrepreneurial young people.\n\nWe will begin to develop a similar Agripreneurship Academy to help the next generation of farmers to work in a regenerative way. The academy will address topics ranging from climate change, agroforestry and soil health to animal welfare.\n\nAbove all, by prioritizing young people in our global strategic goals and our brands\u2019 individual plans, we can continue to make a difference in the lives of millions of young people around the world.\n\nYoung people are not simply tomorrow\u2019s workforce. Their innovative ideas can transform the way we work, maximize our impact and accelerate a just transition to regenerative global food systems.\n\nAgainst the context of youth unemployment, which significantly increased during the pandemic, and the rising average age of farmers, it is crucial we demonstrate Nestl\u00e9 is the natural home for young entrepreneurs active in the food space. We want to be a company with a nurturing atmosphere, renowned for transforming good ideas into viable businesses that help feed the world and protect the planet.\n\nTo simplify that process and harness good ideas from anywhere, and from anyone of any background, we created the Youth Entrepreneurship Platform, or YEP. It is a single, online location where young people can be inspired by previous entrepreneurial initiatives and discover the wide range of help we can offer to bring innovation to life, whether related to regenerative agriculture, plant-based products, packaging and circularity or affordable nutrition.\n\nYEP is a one-stop shop to access standalone initiatives such as our international network of 14 R+D Accelerators, our online internships or Nesternships, Purina\u2019s Unleashed accelerator and wider information about the Nestl\u00e9 needs YOUth initiative. This approach effectively consolidates the full spectrum of our activities in this area to ensure we get the most out of budding entrepreneurs rather than engaging with a single initiative.\n\nA free learning tool\nAccess to the site is free. It offers a catalogue of entrepreneurial case studies, profiles of young innovators we already support, plus an e-learning academy of educational content and news of workshops, digital events, local initiatives and training opportunities.\n\nYoung people can attend webinars, access personal mentoring and coaching from experienced staff and gain access to early-stage investment, learning from real-life examples from well-known brands such as Nescaf\u00e9, Gerber and Garden Gourmet.\n\nWe have big plans for YEP and are building a community. After an initial social media campaign that generated 48,000 leads, we hired a dedicated community manager to monitor interactions on the platform and provide targeted, interactive content to further engage people. Early analysis shows that people visit the site for one hour on average.\n\nLessons learned from the way this community develops will inform our plans to build a similar platform, the Agripreneurship Academy, to harness innovative ideas for shaping the farming of the future.\nOur diverse and inclusive culture\n\nNurturing inclusivity enhances employee well-being and makes us more productive and innovative \u2013 helping us transform global food systems.\n\nBackground\n\nWe believe that nurturing and promoting a diverse and inclusive culture makes Nestl\u00e9 a more attractive and exciting organization to work for. By advocating for and embracing inclusion, we are seeking to unleash the full potential of our workforce. When they can bring their whole selves to work, we find our employees feel more engaged, productive, happier and fulfilled, with a sense of belonging.\n\nOur aim is to cultivate a diverse and inclusive workforce, business culture and leadership. We believe this provides equal opportunities for everyone to contribute, grow and feel valued and is characterized by an open-minded spirit and a profound sense of belonging.\n\nWe believe that this approach not only helps our business better reflect the world at large but that it is a powerful unifying force that can help us to accelerate a just transition to regenerative food systems.\n\nWe recognize that we must navigate the complexity of varying social and cultural conventions and differing legislative approaches to diversity and inclusion around the world. This includes political scenarios that are less favorable to under-represented groups. We are also anxious to counter setbacks widely regarded as having been experienced by under-represented groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. This included challenges in working from home, the need to deal with parenting and homeschooling \u2013 with gender equality suffering in particular \u2013 and people with some disabilities experiencing challenges in remote working.\n\nWOMEN IN LEADERSHIP\n\nTarget achieved: 30% of our top 200+ senior executive positions are held by women\n\nWOMEN IN MANAGEMENT\n\nMiddle and senior management that are female (%)\n\n| Year | Percentage |\n|------|------------|\n| 2020 | 25.6%      |\n| 2021 | 27.2%      |\n| 2022 | 30.2%      |\n\n43.8% in 2021\n45.3% in 2022\n\n30.2% 200+ senior executive are women\n\n45.3% Middle and senior management are female\n\nSDG CONTRIBUTIONS\nApproach\nDiversity and inclusion is one of six key areas that govern how we manage our people within Group Human Resources (HR) and Business Services. As such, diversity and inclusion leadership at Nestl\u00e9 is embedded in the HR Leadership team, which includes HR Heads of Zone, function and business. Diversity and inclusion objectives are cascaded to their respective markets. Regular updates are provided to the Executive Management Board and the Board of Directors, who review progress. We are evolving from group-led initiatives on these topics to market- and brand-led activity, as diversity and inclusion becomes progressively embedded in individual cultures and workplaces. We have five diversity and inclusion pillars, which intersect with each other (e.g. young and disabled).\n\nGender balance\nWe are striving to increase the proportion of women in our top 200+ senior executive posts through our Gender Balance Acceleration Plan, while our Global Parental Support Policy extends the rights of caregivers regardless of age. We participate in international campaigns such as International Women\u2019s Day and are proud to have our Equality Index.\n\nPeople with disabilities\nWhen we employ people with disabilities, we aim to be attentive to their needs \u2013 whether their disability is visible or invisible. We run Employee Resource Groups focused on people with disabilities and neurodiversity, such as THRIVE, while our NestAbility network aims to create an open culture and dialogue around disability. We promote the inclusion of people with disabilities through membership of the ILO Global Business and Disability Network and have signed The Valuable 500 commitment to elevate disability inclusion to our leadership agenda.\n\nLGBTQ+ community\nNestl\u00e9 supports the United Nations Standards of Conduct for Business on tackling discrimination against LGBTQ people and is part of the Partnership for Global LGBTI Equality, the only LGBTQ+-focused organization in the world where the private sector and civil society sit together as members. Local LGBTQ+ networks in many Nestl\u00e9 markets support colleagues by creating a forum for conversation. We also collaborate with external groups to advocate for civil rights and workplace protections, develop our understanding of key issues and create programs that reflect local contexts.\n\nRace and ethnicity\nWe strive to advance racial and ethnic inclusion. We work to eliminate unconscious bias and to appoint local employees who represent the communities we serve to management positions in the countries we operate in. Nestl\u00e9 was a founding member of the World Economic Forum\u2019s Partnering for Racial Justice in Business initiative.\n\nGenerations\nWe have five different generations in our global workforce and we actively encourage all of them to bring their different perspectives and knowledge to work.\n\nIn 2021, we launched the Mentoring For All program to facilitate knowledge sharing between different generations. By enhancing curiosity and peer-to-peer learning from each other\u2019s experiences, this program aims to increase cross-generational engagement and create a stronger sense of inclusion and belonging. In our endeavor to support our employees in their transition from work to retirement, we designed and piloted the Life Transition Program in 2022, with employees and champions across eight different countries. Through this program, we aim to enable a meaningful and purposeful transition and early preparation regardless of age.\n\nExternal viewpoint\nInspiring high-achieving students of color from low-income backgrounds\n\nWhy Nespresso is supporting inclusion through Thrive Scholars\nIt takes more than good grades and a college degree to secure an amazing job and build an upwardly mobile career. In North America, talented students of color from low-income backgrounds struggle to get into college or progress onto graduate schools and into the workforce due to systemic barriers.\n\nThat\u2019s where Thrive Scholars comes in. We help high-achieving Black, Latino, and other underrepresented students with college advising, career coaching and mentorship to help them excel at top colleges and transition into professions that lead to economic mobility.\n\nOver our 20 years, we found that college preparation is vital and that starting early is the key to our success. We engage Scholars in their junior year of high school with our Summer Academy: a six-week intensive program over two summers of college-level courses. Throughout our six-year program, our Scholars receive financial support, social-emotional guidance and career development through our Career Pathways program. Our career coaching helps Scholars navigate and leverage opportunities to join the advanced workforce and become corporate leaders. Through our program, Scholars develop the technical skills and essential competencies like computer literacy, writing acumen, data analysis, communication, critical thinking and leadership. This is why we play an essential part in enhancing diversity in the workplace.\n\nWe can\u2019t correct disparities in corporate diversity alone \u2013 we depend on partners to acknowledge the ongoing problem and partner with us.\n\nWhen companies like Nespresso support us, we vastly strengthen and expand our academic, mentorship and career development resources to students across the country.\n\nBy supporting Thrive Scholars to reach their highest potential, Nespresso is directly influencing and guiding the diverse leaders of tomorrow. With the preparation our Scholars receive, they are in the best position to apply for internships or full-time employment opportunities that arise at the company.\n\nNespresso isn\u2019t just securing a diverse pipeline of future talent, but also sending a clear message to our Scholars: they can challenge the makeup of the workforce and they deserve to work at familiar, influential companies regardless of their ethnicity or economic background. Nespresso is helping to change the narrative.\n\nSteve Stein\nCEO, Thrive Scholars\n\n\u201cBy nurturing Thrive Scholars to be their best selves, Nespresso is directly influencing and guiding the diverse leaders of tomorrow.\u201d\n\nSteve Stein\nCEO, Thrive Scholars\n\nTable of contents\n\nCreating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2022\nGender balance\n\nAs part of our plan to balance the gender makeup of our workforce, we are delighted to report that, as of December 31, 2022, 30.2% of our top 200+ senior executive positions were held by women, up from 27.2% in 2021 and meeting our commitment. The proportion of women occupying middle and senior managerial positions increased to 45.3%, up from 43.8% in 2021.\n\nNestl\u00e9 has pledged to help accelerate the pace toward equal pay for equal work since 2019. To make sure that men and women performing comparable jobs get equal pay, we make sure that an annual equal pay review is conducted for all markets and they remain responsible for addressing actions locally and eliminating the conditions that may create systemic pay gaps. Our 2022 Global Equal Pay review completed with highly satisfactory results. No systemic equal pay gap was found within the Group. Nestl\u00e9 continues to comply with all disclosures on equal pay in relevant markets as required by the local legislation and methodologies specified (e.g. United Kingdom, France, Switzerland). For the fourth consecutive year, the \u201cBloomberg Gender-Equality Index\u201d recognized Nestl\u00e9 for our transparency in gender reporting.\n\nWe continue to advocate for women in our supply chain. In less developed countries where women are often expected to fulfill traditional roles, Nestl\u00e9 has been empowering women in various ways. For example, thousands of women in Pakistan have been trained in our dairy supply chain since 2010.\n\nIn Brazil, we supported 10 women farmers in our supply chain through Masters degrees in Dairy Administration as part of Nestl\u00e9 Brazil\u2019s For\u00e7a da Mo\u00e7a do Campo initiative in 2022. The course is based on the principles of lean management, which focuses on maximizing efficiency, to help them more effectively manage the 950 cows and 22,000 liters of milk they collectively produce daily. Ten more women have been identified for 2023.\n\nNespresso has developed a field-tested gender analysis tool to help identify the root causes of gender inequality in coffee farming. The tool is informed by rigorous data collection and in-depth gender analysis of men and women in farming households. The insights are used to target actions \u2013 so that women are given access to the resources they need and are empowered to be part of the decision-making process. To advance industry-wide change, the tool has been made publicly available.\n\nPeople with disabilities\n\nOur efforts to embed an inclusive culture for people with disabilities were recognized in the 2022 Disability Equality Index of the Best Places to Work, an initiative between the American Association of People with Disabilities and non-profit group Disability:IN. It recognized Nestl\u00e9 USA and Nestl\u00e9 Purina PetCare with scores of 100%.\n\nIn October 2022, Nestl\u00e9 in Spain and Fundaci\u00f3n Universia launched the second iteration of the IN-Tech program, aimed at university students with disabilities, to help them develop IT skills and gain workplace experience.\n\nIn Brazil, we launched a limited edition range of biscuits: Nestl\u00e9 Passatempo Libras. It comes with the National Deaf Alphabet on biscuits, helping families to learn Libras (Brazilian sign language) while having fun and eating. We also launched a website with additional Libras content.\n\nIn France, Nespresso announced a partnership with Caf\u00e9 Joyeux, which employs people with disabilities in Paris. A portion of proceeds from a specially developed blend of coffee will go to the caf\u00e9, helping it sustain 40 jobs for one year.\n\nLGBTQ+ community\n\nIn early 2022, Nestl\u00e9 USA, Nestl\u00e9 Health Science and Nestl\u00e9 Purina PetCare all received scores of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation\u2019s 2022 Corporate Equality Index. This is the foremost benchmarking survey and report in the United States measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality.\n\nDuring Pride Month, in June 2022, a Nestl\u00e9 global webcast covering unconscious bias, support in the workplace and mental health was watched live by 1400 employees, with another 3000 watching a recording afterwards, and reached a total of 33,000 employees across global and diversity and inclusion groups. Within specific markets, our brands are also demonstrating their support for LGBTQ+ communities.\n\nRace and ethnicity\n\nFor the first time, Nestl\u00e9 USA began disclosing pay gaps based on race, ethnicity and disability as well as gender. As a result, Nestl\u00e9 USA has reported pay equity in under-represented minority employee salaries for the first time (2021 data, disclosed in 2022).\n\nTable of contents\n\nCreating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2022 53\nOutlook\nBuilding a culture of inclusion where everybody feels they belong will always be a moving target as society evolves, reacts and responds to wider change. We will always encourage employees to stay vocal about emerging challenges to inclusion and we remain open to new opportunities to celebrate diversity.\n\nIn 2023, we will launch guidelines for brands to help them speak more inclusively in their marketing and communications. This will help our market teams to create advertising and other promotional activities that reflect local contexts and align with our wider goals on diversity and inclusion.\n\nFrom 2023, Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality\u2122 Program Gender Equality Index will measure progress against ten KPIs in three categories. These tools will guide Nespresso\u2019s interventions in the various AAA countries. In line with Nespresso\u2019s gender equality strategy, it will strive to increase the number of female agronomists to 40% by 2025 and 50% by 2030. Having achieved our commitment to parity in all management positions.\n\nHow we are helping First Nations content creators kickstart their careers in Australia.\n\nNestl\u00e9 Oceania has recently launched an initiative to help aspiring First Nations \u2013 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples \u2013 content creators to choose their career path.\n\nThe idea to link the world of content creation, production and media with some of Australia\u2019s biggest brands and media companies was born in 2020, when Nestl\u00e9 Australia struggled to find a crew of First Nations videographers, stylists and producers to create content for a National Aboriginal and Islander Day Observance Committee Week campaign.\n\nIt quickly became apparent that there was a distinct under-representation of First Nations creatives in this space, which prompted Nestl\u00e9 Australia to consider how they could foster better opportunities for emerging talent to break into the industry.\n\nTuck In!\nAgainst this backdrop, and after two years of behind-the-scenes preparation, the aptly named Tuck In! program began in July 2022. The initiative brings together established First Nations chefs with would-be content creators to develop recipes and video content that celebrates the combination of bush foods and Nestl\u00e9 products.\n\nFor the first project, two brands \u2013 Nescaf\u00e9 Blend 43 and Nestl\u00e9 Sweetened Condensed Milk \u2013 partnered with Gamilaraay chef Keith Munro from a Sydney-based restaurant to create recipes including macadamia amaretti biscuits and coffee, wattleseed and banana loaf.\n\nThe video content \u2013 produced with professional media and creative support \u2013 was brought to life by selected Australian Film, Television and Radio School graduates, with work experience also going to graduates from our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Youth Development Program (AYDP).\n\nSeeing is believing\nThe resulting content was communicated across Nestl\u00e9\u2019s network of news and food websites and social media channels \u2013 celebrating Aboriginal culture through native ingredients, encouraging home cooks to try bush foods and supporting the visibility and development of First Nations creatives.\n\nThe aim is that the program will become an annual initiative, giving ongoing opportunities in line with Nestl\u00e9\u2019s vision to unlock the power of food to enhance the quality of life for all in support of a just, equitable and unified future.\n\nFirst Nations Australians\nFirst Nations are the first peoples of Australia. And while they represent 3.2% of the resident population, these indigenous communities often suffer disproportionate social and economic disadvantages.\n\nNestl\u00e9 has long supported First Peoples as the traditional owners of the lands where we live and work and we are committed to deepening understanding of the richness and diversity of their culture and values both inside and outside the company.\n\nNestl\u00e9 has joined a network of over 1100 corporate, government and not-for-profit organizations that have made a formal commitment to reconciliation and strengthening relationships with First Peoples through a Reconciliation Action Plan, where the AYDP remains the flagship program.\n\nIn 2010, Nestl\u00e9 launched its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Youth Development Program, which recognizes the importance of educating women in creating resilient communities. In partnership with First Nations education program Girls Academy, we have already supported the education of over 11,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander girls.\nAn employer of choice\n\nOur people are at the heart of our commitment to be a \u2018force for good\u2019. Their mental, physical and social well-being is a priority, as is creating a culture in which they can thrive.\n\nBackground\n\nWhile the severity of COVID-19 lessened in 2022, it continued to contribute to a worldwide talent shortage. Other changes are also emerging. The immediate legacy of the shift to more flexible work arrangements has been a change in employee expectations of working conditions. Better work-life balance and alignment between personal and employer values, including sustainability, have an even greater bearing on people\u2019s choice of job and employer.\n\nThis pandemic-related evolution is redrawing traditional concepts relating to jobs and careers. Employees are rethinking their priorities and approaching the employment market with more freedom. Notably, they are willing to change jobs more frequently to find the work-life balance that is best for their personal situation.\n\nThis realignment is forcing employers to rethink practices and strategies. The result is a \u2018war for talent\u2019. There is now a clear focus on a hybrid approach to working and on greater personalization of all parts of the recruitment process and employment. At Nestl\u00e9, we have responded to this shift.\n\nApproach\n\nTalent management\n\nWe strive to attract, hire, develop and retain the right candidates to be a \u2018force for good\u2019. Our talent acquisition and retention approach is outlined in our People Strategy 2025, which is focused on building a future-ready workforce, developing leadership that is inspiring, disruptive and inclusive, and fostering a culture that is agile and winning. This approach is aligned to our business strategy, Corporate Business Principles and our purpose and values.\n\nWe encourage our people to find new and exciting opportunities within the company. We promote global mobility and work with our employees to fulfill their needs in terms of flexibility, training, growth and reward.\n\nAll our employees are empowered to develop their own careers, supported by their line managers. Our SuccessFactors online system provides a tool and resource for both managers and employees to find guidance and to track this process.\n\n100% Rollout of Global Parental Support policy in all markets\n\n100% Countries where policy against Discrimination, violence and harassment is rolled out\n\n1.21 Recordable injury rate per million hours worked\n\n* Last year\u2019s recordable incident rate has been restated to 1.37 (from 1.33), following recategorization of incidents at a later date.\nEmployee health and well-being\n\nEmployee health is fundamental for building sustainable organizations, driving business performance and demonstrating shareholder value. The Nestl\u00e9 Roadmap for Employee Health serves as a reference for our markets when addressing employee health. Under each pillar, we detail key milestones and deliverables.\n\nNestl\u00e9 Roadmap for Employee Health 2021-2023\n\nOur approach to our people is realized through six key areas:\n\n1. Talent management\n   Attracting, developing and retaining talent while preparing our workforce for the needs of our future business.\n\n2. Diversity and inclusion\n   Building a better business that is inclusive and equal for genders, people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ communities and all races and ethnicities.\n\n3. Employee health, well-being and safety\n   Inspiring and empowering our people to choose a healthier future for themselves, their families and our business. To work only when all required safety measures are in place, speak when anything appears unsafe and create a safe and healthy working environment.\n\n4. Employee relations and engagement\n   Supporting Nestl\u00e9 in its goal to be a company where employees are treated with mutual trust and fairness, and where they feel engaged with our purpose, values and principles.\n\n5. Organizational design and change management\n   Based on our Corporate Business Principles, our culture is supported by regularly updated policies and communicated through our training.\n\n6. Compensation and benefits\n   Providing employees with fair and competitive salaries and benefits and conducting regular performance reviews.\n\nSafety\n\nWe have made the safety of our people one of our core principles. We are committed and determined to prevent serious accidents by continually eliminating risks and by enabling our employees and contractors to adopt safe behaviors.\n\nOur zero-harm vision puts people at the center of everything we do. We aim to create a harm-free work environment with world-class safety performance, to have a positive impact on people\u2019s well-being and to ensure all Nestl\u00e9 employees have a risk anticipation mindset. At the same time, we encourage strategic partnerships to help us in achieving our vision.\n\nWe strive to ensure that the highest safety standards are applied to all our sites, operations and projects, where our focus is on our highest risks. We expect life-saving rules to prevent fatal and serious injuries to be applied with zero tolerance. We empower employees to stop work and speak up if they recognize a situation as unsafe. We also use digital innovation and behavioral science to contribute to the elimination of serious accidents and to help us understand what drives at-risk behaviors and address root causes.\n\nEmployee relations and engagement\n\nWe are committed to treating employees with mutual trust and fairness. We recognize the importance of collaborating with our employees and their representatives and organizations, as well as external labor stakeholders. We work closely together with the International Union of Food Workers to ensure that the needs of our workforce are addressed. Our regular and deep interactions ensure alignment and comprehensive inputs when we review our policies and guidance documents.\n\nCompensation and benefits\n\nWe ensure that our employees are rewarded and recognized for their contributions with competitive pay and benefits. Our Nestl\u00e9 Total Rewards Policy provides a framework within which our teams can create programs that attract, motivate and retain talent. We do this to build a performance culture, to engage our workforce and to contribute toward a positive employee experience.\n\nOrganizational design and change management\n\nWe manage our purpose and values at a global level, providing our markets with the support they need to ensure a consistent culture throughout the company.\n\nWe recognize that the world changes fast, so we constantly evaluate the external environment and adapt when necessary. And we always take local legislation, cultural and religious practices into account.\n\nNestl\u00e9 viewpoint\n\nBuilding the (Nes)future\n\nOur team in China embraces greener choices.\n\n\u201cAre you wondering how you can act more sustainably each day? It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve often asked myself. Nestl\u00e9 is helping employees in the Greater China Zone answer by using an app-based mini program.\n\n\u201cKnown as Nesfuture, the mini program is designed to help inspire and empower all Nestl\u00e9 employees to integrate sustainable activities into our daily lives. The idea came from our teams. It was launched internally on April 22, 2022 \u2013 Earth Day.\n\n\u201cThe mini program offers access to a library of articles that help all local employees to understand and stay up to date on all things sustainable at Nestl\u00e9.\n\n\u201cI use it to keep a record of my carbon reduction activities, such as how I travel (whether I cycle or take the subway over the car), how much I recycle, what food I eat and even whether my cutlery is reusable. The mini program calculates how much carbon I\u2019ve saved and I can immediately see the impact of my small actions.\n\nCompetition and reward\n\n\u201cEven better, we\u2019re recognized for participation, team spirit and consistency. The more days we\u2019re active the higher we score, receiving rankings for both individual and business unit performance. If we make it to the top of the leaderboard, we\u2019re rewarded with either coupons for the Nestl\u00e9 online supermarket or eco-products from Nespresso.\n\n\u201cNesfuture helps me build good habits in the workplace and at home, where I explain the benefits of a low-carbon lifestyle to my daughter.\n\n\u201cNo more trying to remember small changes I make day to day. Using the mini program means I can make a difference all the time. The combination of incentive, repeated action and fun creates long-term positive change.\u201d\n\nShiyu LV\nLegal Counsel\n\nScreenshots of our Nesfuture employee sustainability app in China.\nPerformance\n\nTalent management\nAdaptability is enshrined in our approach to talent recruitment and retention, and is a key tenet of our People Strategy 2025 plan. We constantly evolve our focus to reflect the changing talent acquisition landscape. We have established a number of new working practices and approaches at a local and regional level, to focus the working environment in our factories on employee well-being. For office-based workers, we have formalized a hybrid flexible working policy in all markets. Each market can adapt the policy in line with local conditions.\n\nIn a challenging employment environment, we were recognized as one of the World\u2019s Best Workplaces by Great Place to Work. In 2022, we also focused on communicating personal development opportunities at Nestl\u00e9, in line with our plan to place more emphasis on fostering the skills we need to grow as a business. This strategy was rolled out around the world, with campaigns tailored to individual markets.\n\nFor example, in the United States, we launched a video-led campaign promoting the benefits that we offer, while in China, we introduced the Nesfuture app-based mini program to help our employees track their personal sustainability performance. This includes their daily greenhouse gas emissions (see Nestl\u00e9 viewpoint Building the Nesfuture).\n\nOur people by type of employment\nCovers Nestl\u00e9 employees registered in the human resources system (approximately 96% of all employees). Each data point correct at the time the snapshot was taken.\n\n| Total number of employees by employment contract (by gender) | Permanent | Temporary |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Female                                                      | 147 010   | 62 950    |\n| Male                                                        | 152 629   | 25 544    |\n\n156 600 Employees reached through health promotion activities in 2022 (130 063 in 2021).\n\n9.3 Average number of hours of technical or vocational training provided to workers in the company\u2019s operations (15.8 in 2021)\n\nEmployee engagement, health and well-being\nIn 2022, we continued to evolve and expand our employee engagement initiatives and health and well-being programs. Importantly, we launched new domestic violence victims guidance across the company (see the Agents of change case study).\n\nTo encourage healthy living among our employees, we ran two global communication campaigns in 2022 that addressed our major health risks. These reinforced the importance of physical activity, active breaks, healthy eating and mental health.\n\nAs part of the campaigns, we ensured the availability of healthy food at Nestl\u00e9 canteens. In 2022, 94.6% of our canteens offered a healthy meal (94.4% in 2021) and 54.5% of our markets provided a nap room or equivalent space for rest.\n\nMore broadly, the #NestleLives program includes guidance and interactive exercises across four dimensions: physical activity, sleep, nutrition and mental health, and is available in 16 languages. So far, 33 136 employees have participated with 509 374 video views.\n\nWe also continued to develop our Pleaz digital platform. The platform provides easy access to active breaks. In Pleaz, employees can find guided exercises from stretching to mindfulness that help unwind and renew their energy in a quick active break. Since the launch of Pleaz in July 2021, we had 60 452 activations in the platform, underlining a high level of interest from our employees.\n\nThe Nestl\u00e9 My Health Numbers program enables us to measure the overall health risks of our employee population, helping us to better understand health profiles and the impact of health on productivity and to build strategic, targeted and evidence-based interventions. The program was available to 233 385 employees at the end of December 2022 (227 640 in 2021) and based on the cumulative data, 108 830 Nestl\u00e9 employees so far have participated in the global program (49 687 in 2021). The most prominent health risks continue to be stress, unhealthy eating, lack of physical activity, weight management and poor-quality sleep.\n\nWe continued our series of HealthTalks webinars, with 4066 views in 2022 (54 480 in 2021). They covered the topics of long COVID-19 and eating good food for a better mood.\n\nThe number of employees reached through global employee health promotion communication campaigns such as #HealthyLives and Mental Health Week in 2022 was 156 600.\n\nIn addition, we continued to work with industry bodies, including with the Consumer Goods Forum, where we are a member of the Employee Health and Well-being working group.\n\nIn 2022, our recordable illness rate per million hours worked was 0.66. There were no recordable fatalities from illnesses and we unfortunately recorded 20 irreversible illnesses.\n\nSafety\nWe deeply regret that six people lost their lives while working for us in 2022 (three in 2021). Four were Nestl\u00e9 employees and two were employed by a contractor. Four fatalities involved road traffic accidents, one occurred on a construction site and one during production operations. All fatal accidents are investigated by an independent investigation team to establish the root causes. We take action to prevent recurrence and share the lessons learned across the company.\n\nIn 2022, 64.6% of our sites had zero recordable injuries and our Group recordable injury rate per million hours worked was 1.21, an 11% reduction compared with 2021. However, there were still 22 serious injuries in 2022 (13 in 2021). We believe that the occurrence of any incident is unacceptable and we believe that by executing our strategy, we will achieve significant improvements in our safety performance in line with our zero-harm vision.\n\nSustainability capability building\nIn Europe, we engage employees through various training courses on sustainability. Also, a lot of hands-on farm visits and educational activities bring sustainability spirit within our teams.\n\nCompensation and benefits\nWe have continued to work toward our commitment to roll out our Global Parental Support Policy across all markets, with 100% markets covered by the end of 2022. We can also report that all Nestl\u00e9 employees are covered by statutory or, when appropriate, sponsored insurance and post-employment provisions.\n\nInnovations\nIn 2022, we continued to pilot the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in our employee skills development and training processes.\n\nDuring the year, we expanded the coverage of our AI-based talent marketplace resource to 13 new Nestl\u00e9 markets. The tool matches people\u2019s skills with project teams they can join. It helps to increase efficiency, foster mobility and develop competencies that support company growth. Talent marketplace was first launched in the United States in 2020 and will be rolled out in more markets in 2023.\n\nTable of contents\nCreating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2022 57\nAgents of change\n\nThe importance of our new Domestic Violence Victims Guidance.\n\nIn June 2022, thousands of people marched against gender violence and femicide in Buenos Aires as part of a movement in its seventh year called Ni Una Menos, or \u201cNot One Woman Less.\u201d Protesters sang loudly, beat drums and lit pink candles, illuminating the Argentine parliament to remember victims in a country where an average of one femicide is recorded every 35 hours, and 81% of those killed are classified as victims of domestic violence.\n\nThis demonstration was a colorful and vibrant show of solidarity for a sensitive issue, one which is not always addressed in public, let alone in the workplace. Very often, domestic abuse is seen as a private matter, where victims go unheard and uncared for. And while the threat looms largest in the home, the risks can quickly reach into the workplace, impacting performance, leading to absenteeism and disrupting careers.\n\nAt Nestl\u00e9, the health and well-being of every employee is our priority. We\u2019re proud of the progress we have made to empower women, and we\u2019re determined to maintain the pace of change by being open about difficult subjects and tackling domestic abuse head on. The workplace can be a sanctuary for those who might otherwise suffer in silence.\n\nFollowing the global guidance and to strengthen our efforts, we launched our Guidance for Providing Support for Employee Victims of Domestic Violence or Abuse Policy in November, in the Plata Region of Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. The guidance is being rolled out globally and provides direction for markets to support employees experiencing or surviving domestic violence. It also aims to raise awareness among employees, remove fears of stigmatization at work for victims and provide guidance to HR Business Partners and People Managers when supporting people in these situations.\n\nIn tandem with the launch, the HR team in Argentina chose November 25, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, to share a podcast addressing domestic violence with employees. During the broadcast, Bel\u00e9n Corti, Nestl\u00e9 Medical Specialist and community psychologist, talked about different types of abuse \u2013 mental, physical, economic and sexual \u2013 and gave example situations in a family environment or in a current or past relationship. Most importantly they explained how and where to get help.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest challenges in addressing domestic violence in the workplace is getting employees to recognize the value of speaking up,\u201d Gonzalo Ramos explains. \u201cIf we can demonstrate that we are here to support employees and have a team of specialists on standby to provide confidential and constructive advice, we can provide employees with credible solutions.\u201d\n\nThe podcast was the first in a planned series of events to help bring the new policy to life. From 2023, the HR team \u2013 working closely with NGOs \u2013 will travel to each Nestl\u00e9 location in the region to talk to employees in a bid to break down the taboos surrounding the issue. They will also run several programs to train leaders and reinforce the message that violence and abuse should never be tolerated at home or in the workplace.\n\nEmpowering people to speak up\n\n\u201cThe launch of clear guidelines is a critical step toward empowering people in our region,\u201d says Gonzalo Ramos, Human Resources Business Partner and Employee Relations Manager in Argentina. \u201cStatistics here show domestic violence incidents are increasing year on year. And while 78% of the affected people are women and girls, anyone can be affected, regardless of gender, age, race, sexual orientation or faith.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, we aim to keep building our personal and career development resources. We will expand our use of AI to develop and train our employees, rolling out key tools in more markets around the globe.\n\nOur employee relations teams will be instrumental in implementing human rights salient issue action plans that relate to our own workforce. These are focused on freedom of association and collective bargaining, health and safety at work, living income and living wage, forced labor and responsible recruitment, and gender equity, non-discrimination and non-harassment.\n\nWithin our employee health and wellness agenda, we will continue to work through our roadmap toward our 2023 goals. Going forward, we intend to expand well-being to include additional focus areas (such as those relating to financial, social and career considerations), in addition to the existing physical and mental well-being pillars. We plan to update our Global Parental Support Policy and, by the end of 2023, expect every market to have an employee relations strategy in place.\n\nWe will also continue to strengthen our safety culture in the context of our zero-harm ambition, placing increased focus on road safety, life-saving rules and impactful safety systems, and we will further develop the Nestl\u00e9 Global Women in Safety Network.\n\nOutlook\n\nIn 2023, we aim to keep building our personal and career development resources.

Trust in Nestl\u00e9 is fundamental to our culture and to the value chain evolution we are leading.\n\nBackground\nTo earn the trust of stakeholders, organizations are expected to operate with high standards of integrity and business ethics.\n\nIn order to meet such expectations, we ensure that the company promotes open and transparent communication and interaction. We also ensure the continuous evolution of a Speak Up culture, where people and a healthy working environment will always be protected.\n\nEarning trust is crucial \u2013 the trust of customers, consumers, investors, employees, governments and all other stakeholders is fundamental to succeeding as a business over the long term.\n\nNestl\u00e9 values this trust above all else. It is the basic foundation on which our business is built. We work to deserve this trust and to safeguard our reputation by behaving ethically, by enabling people to speak up when concerns arise and by managing data responsibly and with transparency. In addition, the regulatory environment has continued to become more rigorous and to touch more deeply on the need for companies to conduct sustainable businesses and operations.\n\nApproach\nWe conduct business in an ethical and principles-based manner, even in the absence of applicable regulatory requirements. We take a coordinated, holistic and risk-based approach to monitoring our conduct against regulatory requirements, societal expectations and our internal standards. Our commitment to integrity, fairness and authenticity are enshrined in our company\u2019s purpose and values.\n\nOur Corporate Business Principles are mandatory for all employees and are supported by our Code of Business Conduct and other policies. In particular, the Code specifies certain non-negotiable minimum standards in key areas of employee behavior, including integrity, compliance with laws, conflicts of interests, antitrust and fair dealing, bribery, corruption (UN Global Compact Principle 10), discrimination and harassment, and accurate reporting and accounting.\n\nWe integrate these policies and standards into our business planning, activities, operations, performance reviews and auditing. Where our own principles and policies differ from local legislation, the higher standard applies.\n\nBusiness ethics and compliance\nOur comprehensive Compliance Program supports the continuous development and implementation of our Corporate Business Principles based on ethics and integrity. It empowers our employees and managers to do the right thing for the right reason. The program supports our work related to environmental and social matters and is a foundation for making Nestl\u00e9 a force for good.\n\nManaging data responsibly and ethically\nOur commitment to protecting personal data and privacy is reflected in our mandatory Global Privacy Program, our Data Ethics Framework and our Corporate Business Principles. We are transparent about how we process people\u2019s data and provide meaningful control over how personal data is collected and used. We avoid using data and technology in ways that are unethical or could lead to discrimination and exploitation or cause harm.\nAltogether, this use of technology helps us in our deforestation before it happens. We use data from satellite monitoring to evaluate payments to farmers, among other benefits. We make our income accelerator program that facilitates direct improvements and evaluate the responsible measures applied at each stage.\n\nTechnology is integral to many of our initiatives, including our income accelerator program that facilitates direct payments to farmers, among other benefits. We make sure to keep data safe to respect farmer and supplier privacy. We use data from satellite monitoring to evaluate forest areas at risk, a strategy that is aimed at preventing deforestation before it happens.\n\nOverall, this use of technology helps us in our sustainability efforts throughout our supply chains.\n\n**OUR 4 COMPLIANCE PROGRAM PILLARS**\n\n1. **Compliance governance and culture**\n   Our strong culture of business ethics is led and driven by senior management. We are determined to ensure that our policies, standards and procedures, supported by robust governance and processes, enable us to conduct business in an ethical and principles-based manner, to fulfill our business requirements and to meet societal evolution and expectations, while reinforcing a Speak Up culture.\n\n2. **Communication and training: dissemination of processes and tools**\n   We run yearly communication campaigns to share and reinforce ethics and compliance guidance, and to share information on the evolution of our compliance culture, principles and values. Training materials and tools are continually developed and implemented to support and monitor this process.\n\n3. **Monitoring and reporting**\n   Our global CARE social audit program was started in 2005 and is aimed at verifying that all employees and Nestl\u00e9-operated sites comply with local legislation, our Corporate Business Principles and our Code of Business Conduct. External auditors assess compliance with our Corporate Business Principles against seven pillars: conditions of work and employment, business integrity, safety and health, environmental sustainability, security, local communities and labor accommodation. In addition, our Human Rights Framework and Roadmap provides a comprehensive approach for assessing and developing preventive and corrective measures to respect human rights in our business relations with third parties.\n\n4. **Closing gaps**\n   We carry out continuous risk assessments to define the priorities and focus areas of our Compliance Program. We ensure that ethical discussions, consequence management and action plans are duly executed.\n\nIn all areas: automation of systems and processes\n   The execution of our Compliance Program is supported by the continuous deployment and improvement of digital tools, which provide effective and actionable monitoring and reporting.\n\n---\n\n**External viewpoint**\n\n**Race to the top**\n\nThe importance of transparency in corporate reporting.\n\nThe private sector has a critical role to play in achieving the SDGs. Companies that robustly measure, manage and report their impacts help us move toward a more sustainable future for everyone. But doing this is easier said than done. How do we incentivize and accelerate the biggest players in the private sector to get on board? How do we move from simple statements of intent to changes in corporate behavior?\n\nOne way is by increasing levels of transparency and accountability. In an ideal world, every company would publicly commit to achieving science-based targets, they would produce all the relevant data internally to track progress, and then publish this data for stakeholders who could help drive progress, and shareholders who could make better decisions on how and where to invest. However, without a universal governing body or framework, companies often fall short of this ideal.\n\nBy benchmarking companies, you can create a kind of league table on SDG impact. You tap into a company\u2019s competitive spirit and trigger a race to the top. At the World Benchmarking Alliance, we use publicly available data, company questionnaires and reliable third-party sources to rank companies from first to last. We focus on the companies that can have the biggest impact, offering them a scorecard with suggestions on how to improve. All the rankings are made available for free.\n\n---\n\n**The benefit of benchmarking**\n\nCompanies can use our benchmarks to assess progress against their peers and use our methodologies as guidance for what science and society expect. As soon as a benchmark is made public, it immediately shows performance and provides a common global language for talking about sustainable business practices. How did we perform? What can we do to get better?\n\nOur Theory of Change is simple: by comparing one company to another in a public way in front of investors, customers, employees, NGOs, regulators, trade associations and other stakeholders, we can spotlight the best and worst performers. We can recognize the companies that lead and hold those that lag behind to account, ultimately encouraging both to improve. Our aim is that businesses will fulfill their responsibility in helping to transform the system for both people and the planet.\n\nIn the long run, greater transparency and accountability for corporate reporting allows investors to influence the companies they invest in, helps governments to develop better policies, drives civil society to direct public support and partnership efforts and enables individuals to decide where to spend their money or where they\u2019d like to work. In other words, it creates a marketplace for companies to make a real difference.\n\n---\n\n**#2**\n\nNestl\u00e9 ranks #2 of 350 companies in the World Benchmarking Alliance\u2019s Food and Agriculture Benchmark.

The guideline covers recommendations and requirements on the handling, review and investigation of all non-compliance allegations. It also provides direction on the execution of our non-retaliation commitment to all allegations raised in good faith.\n\nNon-compliance concerns raised through Speak Up by category\n\n| Breakdown categories for Speak Up messages | Messages received | Messages substantiated |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|\n| Abuse of power and/or mobbing/bullying     | 743              | 222                   |\n| Unfair treatment                          | 388              | 26                    |\n| Labor practice                            | 272              | 69                    |\n| Harassment (excluding sexual harassment)   | 158              | 52                    |\n| Theft/misappropriation or misconduct on accounting/financial statement | 126 | 35 |\n| Safety and health                         | 122              | 21                    |\n| Violation of laws/regulations             | 120              | 27                    |\n| Gifts, favors and relatives, conflicts of interest | 91 | 22 |\n| Bribery and corruption                     | 88               | 22*                   |\n| Violence and discrimination               | 85               | 16                    |\n| Sexual harassment                         | 81               | 16                    |\n| Confidential information, Privacy Policy (data privacy, trade secrets, intellectual property) | 65 | 8 |\n| Third-party compliance                    | 54               | 8                     |\n| Seeking compliance advice                  | 43               | 5                     |\n| MANCOM members related                    | 27               | 6                     |\n| Human rights (total labor, forced labor and modern slavery risks) | 16 | 0 |\n| Environmental impact                      | 14               | 2                     |\n| Trade sanctions                           | 12               | 0                     |\n| Arbitrarily and favor dealing              | 9                | 0                     |\n| Non-compliance with WHO Code              | 5                | 1                     |\n| Executive Board member/behavior managers in Switzerland | 4 | 0 |\n\n* Messages substantiated related to kickbacks and did not involve government officials.\n\nEmployees are required to take-compliance training every year.\n\nCompliance and Corporate Business Principles training\nTo help strengthen our compliance culture, we continue promoting the global mandatory e-learning sessions, delivering 817,312 modules in 2022 (1.2 million in 2021, 300,000 in 2020). Much of the training is related to our Corporate Business Principles.\n\nEmployees are required to complete a set of 11 mandatory e-learning sessions.\n\nCARE audits\nThe number of CARE audits continued to register a positive evolution in 2022, at 264 (247 in 2021). This trend reflects a return to a full regularity in performing CARE audits as the impact of COVID-19 becomes less severe.\n\nOur CARE reviews have a broad scope. Their content is based on the SMETA social auditing methodology and enriched with requirements specific to Nestl\u00e9. The Danish Institute of Human Rights also provided input on the program. The wide range of topics include health and safety and working conditions, such as labor accommodation for on-site workers.\n\nMonitoring and reporting\nWe are constantly evolving our compliance monitoring and reporting. In 2022, we conducted a quality review of consequence management for substantiated Speak Up non-compliance concerns, using improved trend analysis data. We have also enhanced our current conflict-of-interest declaration process. Data quality and automation initiatives continue to be our key priorities. By doing this, we ensure visibility and enable better business and management decisions.\n\nData protection and privacy\nIn 2022, we launched our Salient Issue Action Plan on Data Protection and Privacy. It reflects our commitment to privacy and the rights of the individual in relation to digitalization.\n\nOur plan is designed to ensure that we operate to high standards and respond to the growing trend for stronger data protection and privacy laws. We are also responding to the expectations of consumers, investors, customers and regulators on how data is used by corporations.\n\nThe plan is based on our Privacy Program, with tools such as maturity self-assessments, privacy impact assessments, vendor privacy risk assessments and internal and external audits used to mitigate risk and report on performance.\n\nThe number of data breaches notified to the relevant authorities and affected individuals was eight in 2022. Each reported breach is counted once, regardless of the number of people affected. Also in 2022, we continued to train employees on data ethics and how to manage data legally and responsibly through an e-learning module titled Data Ethics at Nestl\u00e9, as well as through our Corporate Business Principles e-learning.\nOur Speak Up culture.\n\nWe promote an inspiring, innovative, transparent and open work environment, where each employee is respected, has the liberty to engage, create and contribute, always with the ability to speak up. Therefore, everyone in the organization is encouraged to speak openly on any matter. Each employee is free to discuss any matter with his or her line manager and, in order to ensure the continuous evolution of such work environments, can approach Human Resources, Compliance or access our Speak Up with full confidentiality.\n\nAn annual communication campaign\n\nIn 2022, we launched our annual employee communication campaign to reinforce the Speak Up culture and share the previous year\u2019s results. The campaign disclosed the items reported through the channel in 2021 and candidly stated that 133 employees had to leave the company and six service provider contracts had been terminated as a consequence of the substantiated cases.\n\nIn addition, we used the World Whistleblower Day on June 23 to promote our Speak Up culture across the organization. We conducted a communication campaign to thank our colleagues for having the courage to step forward and report non-compliance concerns. We also used a quiz on our internal Workplace as an engaging way to help employees improve their knowledge of Speak Up. Our global campaigns are supplemented by numerous communication campaigns in the markets.\n\nWe believe that the robust system and consistent communications are proving a potent mix. Nestl\u00e9 is sending a strong message and consequently having a local impact through its actions: setting high standards for its employees and external stakeholders, creating a robust framework against which to measure behavior and, importantly, taking decisive consequence management decisions and improvement actions.\n\nAll of this is fundamental to remaining true to our values, which are based on respect and ultimately drive our success.\n\nTechnology-driven transparency\n\nOur work with partners to test and deploy technology in our upstream supply chains continued in 2022.\n\nIn C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, we began using mobile payment technology as part of the Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan\u2019s income accelerator program. The technology allowed us to pay premiums as part of the plan directly to the farmers and their spouses. A notable benefit of this technology is that we have a high degree of confidence that the entire incentive reaches the household promptly and that all these transactions are completely traceable.\n\nFor many of the rural farmers, this was the first banking facility of any kind that they had ever set up and we provided considerable assistance to them. In many cases, this also involved obtaining basic identity documents, such as birth certificates for farmers.\n\nMobile technology allows us to make payments from our income accelerator program directly to farmers and their spouses.\n\nOutlook\n\nLooking ahead, we will continue applying and developing our commitments to fairness and authenticity, enabling our employees and managers to do the right thing for the right reason, while protecting and strengthening Nestl\u00e9\u2019s reputation.\n\nOur mandatory compliance training and relevant communication campaigns will continue to help strengthen our ethical business culture. We continue to evolve and enhance the Speak Up program and its case management system, with the support from internal teams and the relevant service provider. Based on the Human Rights Framework and Roadmap, we have issued specific action plans for our 10 salient issues.\n\nEthical behavior is rooted in respect\n\nIt is important for employees to feel able to raise concerns \u2013 which is why we work hard to build a Speak Up culture.\n\n\u201c...Our commitment to full confidentiality, protection and non-retaliation on the treatment of all non-compliance allegations made in good faith is essential to ensuring trust in our organization and encourages others to speak up.\u201d\n\nFlavio de Souza\nNestl\u00e9 Chief Compliance Officer\n\nTable of contents\n\nCreating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2022 62\nAbout this report\n\nThis Creating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2022 aims to provide a full and balanced picture of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s material topics, related impacts and performance in the calendar year ending 31 December 2022.
