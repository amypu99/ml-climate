It includes comments from our CEO and a description of our business, followed by our legal annual report. See our corporate governance report on pages 55-72, the administration report including the statutory sustainability report on pages 73-107, and the financial reports on pages 108-140.\n\nOur annual and sustainability report complies with the applicable Swedish and EU legislation as well as the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the EU. External frameworks in this report include the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), which can be found as a part of the administration report on pages 103-107.\n\nWe complement our annual and sustainability report with the sustainability disclosure, which provides additional detailed information on our sustainability strategy, policies, programmes and performance data. The sustainability disclosure complies with external reporting frameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework.\nSome words and phrases used in this report\n\nThroughout this report we use certain words and phrases to describe our approach to addressing specific social and environmental issues. Here, we explain what we mean by these terms.\n\nCircular and circularity are terms we use throughout this report in different contexts. We use them as high-level terms to describe activities aligned with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation\u2019s (EMF) definition of circular economy, which focuses on three principles: eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials (at their highest value), and regenerate nature. More specifically, we support and aspire to the EMF vision for a circular fashion industry, where products are designed to be used more, made to be made again, and made from safe and recycled or renewable inputs. Where we reference our circular ecosystem, we are referring to putting all these principles into practice through the way we operate our business and create our products, including:\n\n\u2014 Circular products: Creating products that are made to last from safe, recycled, regenerative or other more sustainably sourced materials that can circulate multiple times.\n\n\u2014 Circular supply chains: Building scalable systems that circulate products and materials for repair, reuse and recycling and uses lower-impact production processes \u2014 such as dyeing, printing and finishing.\n\n\u2014 Circular customer journeys: Providing convenient ways to engage in circular fashion where products are used more before being repaired, reused and recycled.\n\nCustomer-facing circular business models is an additional term we use to describe circular customer journeys. Circular business models can be in place throughout the entire ecosystem. When we talk about care, repair and reuse models, we frame them as customer-facing circular business models.\n\nFair compensation in our production supply chain refers to a wage that \u2014 in a regular work week, without overtime \u2014 is enough to meet the basic needs of employees and their families and provide some discretionary income. As a minimum, the wage should meet legal levels or applicable collective bargaining agreement levels \u2014 whichever is higher.\n\nOur vision to lead the change means innovating, incubating and investing in scaling new materials, technologies and business models with the potential to decouple our business growth from resource use. It means trying to do things differently, daring to take the first step. It means sharing more data and working to improve the accuracy and comparability of industrywide disclosure. And finally, it means collaborating with others to change the way the industry works and create the legislative environment and infrastructure required for the fashion sector of the future.\n\nMore sustainably sourced, sourced in a more sustainable way or more sustainable describes materials or raw material production, processes, our overall operational activity, or that of our suppliers that have a reduced negative environmental impact compared to conventional alternatives. We base this assessment on various qualitative and quantitative comparative data sources including third-party lifecycle assessment (LCA) data, external benchmarks and assessments, supply chain assessment scores, and data on other KPIs. We further define more sustainably sourced for different materials in our Material Categorisation, Responsible Raw Material Sourcing Policy and Animal Welfare Policy.\nPreferred transport options refers to modes of transport including 100% biofuel, electric and zero emissions vehicles.\n\nRegenerative agriculture is a concept we refer to in relation to raw material production. It is a holistic approach to agriculture that focuses on the interconnection of farming systems and nature. Regenerative farming practices can improve soil health and strengthen the resilience of farmers while also restoring natural habitats.\n\nResponsible is one of the three pillars of our long-term material sourcing vision. In this context it means sourcing materials with the overall aim to respect human rights and reduce environmental impact while contributing to sustainable development in the countries where we source. This is the foundation of all our sourcing decisions. The broader definition of what constitutes a responsible company is defined by international frameworks and for H&M Group it means understanding and taking action to address our impacts on people and the planet, supported by robust systems of governance and transparent external communications.\n\nReverse supply chain is a term for a system that brings used products, materials and production waste back into circulation either as second-hand products, or to be reused or recycled and diverted back into the production system as valuable resources.\n\n1) A zero-emissions vehicle is one that does not emit exhaust gas or other pollutants when operational.\n2) Our definition of responsible sourcing is based on the OECD Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\nLooking back at 2022, it was a turbulent year marked by the war in Ukraine and our thoughts are with all the people affected by this devastating humanitarian crisis. Although the year was challenging, our investments and continuous work on our customer offering have had good results, and full-year sales increased by 12 percent.\n\nIn times of high inflation, when household living costs are rising significantly, it has been more important than ever to offer customers great value for money \u2014 and that is exactly what all our unique brands do.\n\nWe broadened the customer offering further by launching our sportswear initiative H&M Move, which was well received by customers worldwide. This is only one of many examples of how we continued to grow our H&M brand, one of the world\u2019s largest fashion destinations. Our other brands \u2014 COS, Weekday, Monki, & Other Stories and ARKET \u2014 increased sales by 22 percent during the year.\n\nWe also continued to provide our customers with various services that, for example, are connected to reuse and recycling. These initiatives enable products to circulate and resources to be kept in use for as long as possible.\n\nThese examples and so much more have been made possible thanks to our dedicated and amazing teams that always put customers first. I want to express my gratitude to colleagues all across the world for their hard work over the past year.\n\nExternal factors\nEntering 2022, we had left the worst of the negative effects of the pandemic behind us and were off to a good start with well-received collections, increased full-price sales and lower markdowns. Then war broke out in Ukraine, which quickly made us decide to pause sales in the countries affected, make donations in support of Ukraine and eventually wind down our business in Russia and Belarus. This affected many of our colleagues in a negative way and we did our utmost to provide support. The consequences of our decision also had a significant negative impact on our results, since Russia was an important and profitable market for us.\n\nOur results were further impacted by the high inflation, which led to increased costs for freight, raw materials and energy. In combination with a historically strong US dollar, the costs for purchases of goods increased substantially. Rather than passing on the full increase to our customers, we chose to strengthen our market position further.\n\nTo further counter the cost increases and at the same time address the major shift that is continuing in our industry, we carried out extensive work to prioritise various initiatives and review our organisation. In the autumn we therefore initiated a cost and efficiency programme, which is expected to have positive effects in the second half of 2023. We are very mindful of the fact that our colleagues are affected by this, and we are doing everything we can to support those concerned.\n\nThe lower profit for the year compared to 2021 is mainly explained by the negative external factors that affected our purchasing costs, loss of the operating profit from Russia and a one-time cost for the cost and efficiency programme. This was most evident in the fourth quarter, when the combined negative impact of these factors amounted to around SEK 5 billion compared with the same quarter in the previous year.\nFurther integrated sales channels\nOur portfolio of around 4,500 stores worldwide is a great asset for us. In combination with our digital sales channels, our stores enable us to meet our customers when, where and how they want.\n\nWe are continuously optimising the store portfolio to make sure we have the right store with the right format in the right place in each market. This means that we have closed some stores, mostly in established markets, opened new ones in growth markets, and also refurbished and rightsized store areas. At the same time, we continued the integration of our physical and digital sales channels, which strengthen and complement each other.\n\nTo ensure additional capacity and flexibility between our sales channels as well as improved availability for our customers, we continued to invest in tech, AI and our supply chain. By using AI and data across the entire supply chain, we can improve customer satisfaction by ensuring better precision in our quantification, allocation, pricing, personalisation and local relevance \u2014 all while contributing to leaner production and more sustainable use of resources.\n\nOur approach to sustainability\nSustainability is an integral part of our business. This is underlined by our 2030 goal, which combine targets for company growth and profit with reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nTo reach our ambitious climate goals of halving the group\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero by 2040, we invest in projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions throughout our whole value chain. During the year, our climate goals were verified by the Science Based Targets initiative and we established the Green Fashion Initiative to support our suppliers in replacing fossil fuels. We also\nsigned long-term virtual power purchase agreements in the UK, Sweden and Spain to cover electricity consumption in our operations in a majority of European markets. This will not only help us reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, but also secure our energy prices.\n\nOur sustainability work was recognised by, among others, the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the 11th consecutive year. As one of only 12 global retail companies in the index, we are assessed as a leader in environmental, social and governance performance.\n\nInvestments in sustainability provide the group with long-term business opportunities. By building strategic partnerships with key stakeholders and growing in various innovative ways such as circular business models, we can grow our business in a way that decouples our financial growth and profitability from the use of finite natural resources. A good example of this is majority-owned fast-growing Sellpy, which is already one of the biggest players in second-hand fashion in Europe.\n\nOur investment arm CO:LAB is a way for us to explore new business models, and in addition to Sellpy we have invested in startups such as Smartex, Renewcell and Colorifix, to mention just a few. Our investments have in a short time created significant value, for example by improving the customer experience and enabling scaling and commercialisation of recycled and more sustainably sourced materials.\n\nWe will continue to make investments in new business models, materials and technologies that have the potential to drive radical shifts in how we make and remake our products, and how our customers can experience fashion. Alongside these efforts, we will keep working for increased levels of transparency to empower customers to make more informed decisions about the products they buy.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nLooking ahead, our main focus is on continuing to invest in and develop our customer offering and shopping experience for our unique brands, so that we keep meeting and exceeding our customers\u2019 needs and expectations.\n\nDespite the turbulent world around us, H&M Group stands strong with a wide customer base, a robust financial position, healthy cash flow and a well-balanced inventory. Sales in 2023 have started well, showing that we can grow even in troubled times and when customers\u2019 purchasing power is diminishing. We expect the external factors that have negatively affected our purchasing costs to gradually reverse and become positive in the second half of 2023.\n\nOur financial strength and long-term approach enable us to continue investing, and we are increasing capex from SEK 7 billion in 2022 to SEK 10 billion in 2023. All factors combined, there are very good prerequisites for 2023 to be a year of increased sales and improved profitability. Thus, our goal of achieving a double-digit operating margin for full-year 2024 remains in place.\n\nWe see great potential for future expansion \u2014 despite our size, we can still grow and prosper further in new and existing markets.\n\nThis is all thanks to the commitment from colleagues all around the world, who continue to build our company, stand true to our values and ensure we always realise the business idea that our founder laid the ground for 75 years ago \u2014 to deliver our customers unbeatable value with the best combination of fashion, quality, price and sustainability.\n\nHelena Helmersson, CEO\nH & M Hennes & Mauritz AB\nH&M Group at a glance\n\nH&M Group at a glance ........................................ 11\nKey figures .................................................. 12\nSales and stores per region .............................. 13\nHighlights 2022 ............................................. 14\nOur overall business idea ............................... 16\nOur culture and values ................................. 18\n224\nBILLION SEK IN NET SALES, +12% VS. 2021\n\n~30%\nONLINE SALES AS A SHARE OF THE GROUP\u2019S NET TOTAL\n\n79\nMARKETS WITH ONLINE SALES IN 58 MARKETS\n\n24\nBILLION SEK IN CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES\n\n84%\nRECYCLED OR OTHER MORE SUSTAINABLY SOURCED MATERIALS IN OUR COMMERCIAL GOODS.

In August stores in Russia were reopened to sell off the remaining stock as part of the winding down of the Russian operations. As the goods sold out, the stores were closed permanently. The stores in Belarus were also reopened during the autumn and sold off their stock. The last stores in Russia and Belarus closed on 30 November.\nHighlights 2022\n\nDow Jones Sustainability Index\nH&M Group was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the 11th year running. As one of only 12 global retail companies in the index, the score put H&M Group in the list of global companies recognised as leaders in environmental, social and governance performance. We were also included in the S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook.\n\nSecond hand platform Sellpy\nSellpy continues to grow rapidly and increased sales by 85 percent in 2022. Sellpy is already one of the biggest providers of second hand fashion in Europe and is expected to exceed 1 billion SEK in sales in 2023. More than eight million second hand items were traded on the platform across 24 markets in 2022.\n\nGreen Fashion Initiative\nWe established the Green Fashion Initiative to support our suppliers in replacing fossil fuels. As of January 2023, we have 17 approved projects with a potential annual reduction of 50,000 tonnes CO2e in our supply chain, and a potential additional reduction of approximately 140,000 tonnes beyond our own value chain.\n\nCDP score of A- in climate\nH&M Group achieved CDP scores of A- in the climate module, which is the second-best score of a company\u2019s environmental performance and transparency connected to it.\n\nH&M Move\nThe group\u2019s newest initiative H&M Move, a broadened sportswear assortment, has been well received since its launch in August. It is designed to reduce barriers to sports and get everybody moving.\n\nClimate Goals SBTi approved\nOur climate goals were verified by the Science Based Targets initiative. The ambition is to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040 and to reduce absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 56 percent by 2030.\n\nNew markets\nH&M opened its first stores in Ecuador, Kosovo, North Macedonia, and via franchise in Cambodia, Costa Rica and Guatemala.\n\nNew partnerships for renewable solar energy\nWe signed long-term virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) in the UK, Sweden and Spain to cover electricity consumption in our own operations in a majority of European markets. This will not only help us reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, but also secure our energy prices. As part of having signed Sweden\u2019s largest VPPA, the construction of a solar park will commence in 2023, which will supply H&M Group with renewable electricity at a fixed price.\n\n1) Excluding use-phase emissions.\n2) Baseline is 2019.\nNew Water Strategy 2030\nWe reduced relative water consumption in our supply chain by 38 percent, compared to a 2017 baseline. Building on this achievement, we launched our Water Strategy 2030, which focuses on absolute water use reduction rather than measuring relative water efficiency, to clearly decouple growth from resource use.\n\nCorporate Responsibility Reporting Awards\nOur 2020 Sustainability Performance Report was second runner-up for the Best Report and winner for Relevance & Materiality. The report was also first runner-up for the Best Carbon Disclosure Report, second runner-up for Creativity in Communications, and fourth runner-up for Openness & Honesty.\n\nCommunity Investment Initiatives\nWe contributed 114.2 million SEK to community investment initiatives, reaching 745,517 beneficiaries.\n\nFashion Transparency Index\nWe were ranked fourth out of 250 fashion brands and retailers reviewed by Fashion Revolution\u2019s 2022 Fashion Transparency Index. Companies are ranked according to their level of public disclosure of key topics such as human rights and environmental policies, practices and impacts.\nOur overall business idea\n\nThe year 2022 marked 75 years since our founder Erling Persson was inspired to build the foundation for a customer-focused, creative, value-driven and responsible fashion and design company, offering customers all around the world the best combination of fashion, quality, price and sustainability.\n\nWe give our customers unbeatable value and access to a more sustainable lifestyle. Our business consists mainly of sales of clothing, accessories, footwear, cosmetics, home textiles and homeware through our unique brands and ventures \u2014 H&M, H&M HOME, H&M Move, COS, Weekday, Monki, & Other Stories, ARKET, Afound, Singular Society, and our B2B initiative Creator Studio. We are also the majority shareholder in Sellpy.\n\nOur customers are at the heart of every decision we make, and we are continually working to build long-term value-creating relationships with them to create the best possible offering and inspiring experience. This is why we are continuing to integrate our digital and physical channels, to create a customer demand-driven supply chain, and to add new emerging business models and innovations.\n\nWe aim to grow our business in a way that decouples our financial growth and profitability from the use of finite natural resources, so that business and communities can thrive within the planetary boundaries. In early 2022, we strengthened this ambition by introducing a goal to double our sales while halving our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030.\n\nOur financial strength and long-term approach give us the ability to continue investing in improvements to our customer offering and experience as well as in innovations across our value chain such as in tech development, materials and new business models. Customers\u2019 demand for more sustainable products and services is expected to further grow and our offering is well positioned for this. United by our values, we have an ambition to lead the change towards achieving a circular fashion industry with net-zero climate impact, while being a fair and equal company.\n\nWe are for everyone, but everyone is unique. Therefore, we always strive to have diverse teams so that we can better understand our customers\u2019 needs and perspectives. This helps us to create relevant customer offerings and contribute to a more inclusive world through our products and marketing.\n\n1) The baseline for the sales goal is 2021, while the baseline for reducing greenhouse gas emissions is 2019, in accordance with the Science Based Target initiative.\nOur culture and values\n\nH&M Group\u2019s unique company culture is shaped by our shared values. They define who we are, what we stand for and how we act to create environments where people and businesses thrive.\n\nAt the core of our business is a fundamental respect for the individual. This applies to all those involved in and impacted by our business, and includes aspects such as fair wages, working hours, freedom of association, and the opportunity to develop and grow. A solid foundation of fair labour standards and social policies across our operations and supply chain enables good working conditions in safe and healthy environments.\n\nOur value-driven way of working dates back to when the company was founded and continues to guide us today. Our strong values help us stay curious and engaged, and contribute to an open, dynamic and down-to-earth culture where people adapt quickly to change and collaborate in new ways to deliver great customer value.\n\nWe strive to be a fair, equal and relevant employer. Our employees are trusted with great responsibility from the start and are encouraged to seize development opportunities across our brands and functions. Extensive internal recruitment makes it possible to explore a wide variety of roles, and to continue to grow with our business. Our ambition is for leaders to be role models \u2014 empowering, challenging and supporting everyone to make a difference.\n\nAs a global company with colleagues from 175 nationalities, we represent many different cultures and backgrounds. This is an important foundation for us, as it brings a wealth of diverse knowledge, experience and perspectives that enable creativity and innovation. Our diversity makes us strong, and we actively work to create inclusive and welcoming workplaces where everyone is encouraged to be themselves and respect others for who they are.\n\nAt the end of the 2022 financial year, H&M Group had approximately 150,000 employees. Around 75 percent were women and 25 percent were men. In leadership roles, such as store and country managers, women represented 75 percent and men 25 percent. The average number of employees in the group, converted into full-time positions, was 106,522, of which 10,447 were employed in Sweden.\n\n1) At H&M Group we recognise that gender is not binary and that gender identities exist between and outside of male and female. We are investigating how we can adapt our systems to be more inclusive of all genders, while also complying with local laws and regulations.

Each of our brands has a design and buying function that closely follow trends and fashion to create inspiring and relevant assortment.\n\nOur long experience in this field, in combination with customer focus and creativity, are core to the process of creating what our customers want, always with the ambition to deliver value beyond the price our customers pay.\n\nOur many in-house designers bring their diverse backgrounds, perspectives and skills to create collections based on trend forecasts and analysis of customer preferences. Their work is enhanced by technologies such as 3D design and virtual showrooms, decreasing the need to make and ship physical samples, which can save time, resources and reduce environmental impact. In addition, artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities help to optimise how many products to make, where to sell them and when. Aligning supply with customer demand is not only good for our customers, but also for our business and the environment. This supports our ambition to shift to a more circular business across every part of our value chain \u2014 from designing products that are created to last and made of recycled, organic or other more sustainably sourced materials, to product development, production and customer use, reuse and recycling.\n\nDesign is an important first step in developing products that provide the greatest possible value to our customers. Our aim is to use the design process to select materials and processes with a lower negative impact that support a long product life \u2014 through multiple users \u2014 before enabling the product to be fed back into the supply chain for recycling into new fibres.\n\nOur circular product development tool and guide, Circulator, makes predictive assessments on aspects such as durability, recyclability, and the environmental footprint of materials and processes, so that our product designers can make informed choices and balance potential trade-offs.\n\nWe want to drive positive change in the industry, and we use our size and influence to do so. One important aspect of this is to support increasing levels of disclosures across our sector. Transparency enables both accountability and comparability, which empowers customers to make more informed decisions about the products they buy. Together with peers and stakeholders, we have a long history of reporting our progress on sustainability, alongside\n\nH&M and Monki have made denim collections according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation\u2019s Jeans Redesign guidelines, and approximately 40 percent of Weekday\u2019s SS23 denim assortment meets these guidelines. The jeans are designed to be used more, made to be made again, and made from safe and recycled or renewable materials.\n\n& Other Stories launched its first capsule collection exploring design for circularity, and H&M launched its Cherish Waste and Metaverse collections \u2014 all designed using our own product development tool Circulator.\ntesting and piloting new ways of tracing materials and collecting and sharing data \u2014 with the aim to challenge the status quo and highlight areas for improvement. We were the first global fashion retailer to make its supplier list public in 2013, and today we publish it in accordance with the Transparency Pledge, covering most of our tier 1 and 2 suppliers. We were also one of the first brands to test and pilot industry comparable impact data on product level to enable customers to choose more sustainable products.\n\nRecent scrutiny of the fashion industry, including H&M Group, in relation to sustainability claims, highlights the need for us to continue increasing levels of transparency. Historically there has been a lack of legal guidance and standardisation around sustainability claims, and we welcome harmonised legislation and guidance as we take our next steps. Our intention is to continue providing transparent impact data to customers and other stakeholders. Increased transparency makes it easier to identify faults and opportunities for improvement, which ultimately helps drive positive change. We will continue to engage with stakeholders and policymakers to jointly develop an industrywide standard for product transparency.\n\nRead more in our sustainability disclosure about how we work to increase transparency.\n\nTraceability is key to enabling greater transparency. We continue to scale existing initiatives and explore new technologies to further improve the traceability of materials across the supply chain, from fibre to finished product. In 2022, we scaled our traceability programme with TextileGenesis\u2122 to several pilots using blockchain technology, such as rolling out a project for all man-made cellulosic fibres and recycled polyester. We initiated the process for tracing more than 200 million H&M Group pieces on the TextileGenesis\u2122 platform, and approximately 44 million pieces have so far been fully traced1.\n\n1) TextileGenesis\u2122 creates article-level traceability from fibre to product using digital tokens (Fibercoins), ensuring there is no \u201cdouble-counting\u201d of materials. The mechanism enables reliable, real-time data and ensures verification of the origin of materials.\nOur brands and business ventures\n\nAll our brands and business ventures share the same passion for making great and more sustainable fashion and design available to everyone.

With its vision of enabling everyone to live in a more circular way, Sellpy has created a unique service that makes it easy for people to buy and sell second-hand items.\n\nH&M Group has been the majority owner of Sellpy since 2019. Following its 2021 expansion into 22 European markets, Sellpy is currently available in 24 markets, including Sweden.\n\nsellpy.com\nOur omni-model\n\nOur brands and business ventures work together to continuously meet our customers\u2019 ever-evolving expectations. We want to offer a convenient and inspiring experience wherever, whenever and however our customers around the world want to meet us \u2014 in our stores or on all digital touchpoints such as our websites, apps, social media and digital marketplaces.\n\nWe are focusing our expansion on omni-channel growth \u2014 increasingly integrating our digital and physical channels so that they interact and strengthen each other, facilitating a seamless, holistic customer journey.\n\nBy engaging our customers in various ways, we are building long-term, value-creating relationships that stretch far beyond only purchases of products. Our aim to work towards circularity across the entire value chain \u2014 including products, supply chains and customer journeys \u2014 supports our efforts to work for longevity rather than one-off transactions.\nCircular customer journeys\n\nWe continue to increase value for our customers by providing convenient services that enable products to circulate and resources to be kept in use for as long as possible through scaling initiatives such as reuse and recycling models.\n\nWe test and invest in innovative services that span the whole product lifecycle, including garment rental, second-hand, remake, repairs, alterations, garment collecting for textile reuse and recycling and preferred delivery options \u2014 all to help customers make well-informed choices, while creating new revenue streams and supporting the shift to a circular, net-zero fashion industry.\n\nRead more about our customer-facing circular business models in our sustainability disclosure.\n\nWe focus on three areas within our customer-facing circular business models:\n\n- **Use & Care**: We encourage our customers to explore their style and increase the use of their clothes, offering inspiration on how to prolong the life of their garments through care and repair initiatives.\n\n- **Collect & Sort**: We offer our in-store garment collecting programme worldwide to our customers. Our aim is to ensure the donated products are sorted for the most suitable outcome, including reuse as a product or material, or recycling. In 2022, our customers handed in 14,768 tonnes of textiles.\n\n- **Access**: We offer a range of rental and reuse services through which customers can experience fashion while enabling products to circulate. For example, we are the majority shareholder in Sellpy, a digital platform in 24 markets that offers second-hand fashion and other products. In addition, our brands have successfully enabled customers to engage with second-hand fashion and other initiatives, depending on market, channel and brand DNA.\n\n1) Delivery options emitting less greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional delivery options, including 100% biofuel, electric and zero emissions vehicles.\nStores\n\nOur stores welcome customers around the world every day by being a shopping and fashion destination where people can be inspired and physically explore and experience our brands, while we build relationships and provide them with the relevant service.\n\nThe role of the store has evolved, and we continue to optimise our store portfolio to ensure we have the right store with the right format in the right place to meet our customers\u2019 needs. We increase convenience by digitalising the in-store experience and providing omni services, and we continuously elevate our assortment to emphasise storytelling about our fashion and the value for money we provide. Stores are touchpoints on our customers\u2019 journeys, and customers clearly show that they appreciate our stores for proximity, availability, and the opportunity to try on clothes and create looks that they have seen in digital channels.\n\nStores are also an important part of the supply chain, especially with last-mile options, where customers can combine shopping with omni services such as click and collect, pick-up in store and online returns. By adapting how we use our stores and combine different service offerings, we aim to always offer a smooth and flexible shopping experience to keep meeting evolving customer expectations.\n\nWe build, furnish and operate our stores in line with our sustainability goals. We continue to focus on lowering energy consumption, and the majority of our stores are now being equipped with LED lightning. We also focus on smart design and build, using circular principles to carefully decide on the stores\u2019 interiors \u2014 elevating the shopping experience while working to reduce, reuse, repair, recycle and utilise recycled or more sustainably sourced materials.\n\nAs we continue to grow and integrate physical and digital channels, we are adjusting the number and type of stores in each market to secure a healthy and relevant portfolio. H&M Group\u2019s contracts allow around a third of leases to be renegotiated or exited each year. In 2022, we opened 91 (104) new stores and closed 427 (321) stores. This resulted in a net closure of around 336 stores. We had 4,465 stores in 78 markets at the end of the financial year. Most openings are in growth markets, while closures mainly are in established markets. In some markets our products are sold via franchise partners.\n\n1) 175 of the stores closed were in Russia and Belarus, where the business was wound down during the year.\nOnline\n\nOur online and physical stores complement one another, strengthening the offer to our customers. In addition to increasingly integrating these channels to offer a truly seamless experience, we are continuing to enhance the online experience to engage with our customers in relevant ways. For example, we have added new digital experiences in some markets that help our customers discover and browse our assortment in inspiring ways and engage further with our offering by creating and sharing their own styleboards. Also, H&M widened its customer offering online in some markets to include products from other brands. Furthermore, we are also improving the navigation and search experience to help our customers find items they love.\n\nAll our brands have well-developed online operations. H&M has a presence in 58 online markets. COS, Weekday, Monki, & Other Stories and ARKET offer global selling, which enables customers in around 70 additional markets to shop online. The exact number of markets that have this service varies between brands. Several of our brands can also be found on various external marketplaces.\n\nOur increasing focus on AI and tech is key to becoming a more data-driven business. For example, in 2022 we launched a competition with Kaggle \u2014 an online community of data scientists \u2014 to design algorithms for online product recommendations that enhance the customer experience.\nInitiatives for an improved customer experience\n\nCustomer behaviour is changing rapidly, and we work continually on improvements to offer customers the best possible experience. Here are some examples of ongoing initiatives \u2013 some are pilots in a few markets, while others are rolled out in most of our markets:\n\n\u2014 **H&M customer loyalty programme.** Members benefit from personalised offers and digital services, providing inspiration and a smooth customer experience. Members are also rewarded for contributing to a more sustainable lifestyle such as by handing in garments to our garment collecting initiative, choosing a preferred delivery option when shopping online, and bringing their own bag when shopping in store.\n\n\u2014 **More payment options.** Members of H&M can pay now or later through the H&M app, whether shopping in store or online.\n\n\u2014 **Digital receipts.** Customers can receive digital receipts in the H&M app in most markets.\n\n\u2014 **Visual Search.** Image recognition helps customers by making recommendations and suggesting potential buys based on pictures the customer has taken or been inspired by.\n\n\u2014 **Deliveries.** Next-day delivery, express delivery and preferred delivery options continue to be rolled out in more markets.\n\n\u2014 **Find in Store.** On seeing an item online, customers can use their mobile to find it quickly and easily in the size they want, in a physical store as well as online.\n\n\u2014 **Scan & Buy.** Customers can scan the QR code on a product in store to find and buy the item online in the size and colour they want.\n\n\u2014 **Click & Collect** allows customers to pick up online purchases in store.\n\n\u2014 **In-store online returns** let customers return their online purchases in store.\n\n\u2014 **#HMxME** enables customers to share their own fashion stories from Instagram while also providing an easy way to buy the items.\n\n\u2014 **Rate & Review** lets customers rate and review H&M products.\n\n\u2014 **RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)** means that items have a digital tag that can provide precise information on an item\u2019s availability.\n\n\u2014 **Self-service checkouts** offer customers a convenient purchasing option.\n\n\u2014 **Instagram.** In the US, H&M customers can shop directly from inspirational images and videos on Instagram and receive in-app notifications when H&M releases new collections.\n\n\u2014 **Rental in store** offers customers in selected markets the opportunity to rent occasion wear.\n\n\u2014 **Styleboard.** Members can create their own mood boards in the H&M app and shop directly from those. Customers can also add items to their styleboards from brands outside the H&M universe.\n\n\u2014 **Personalised start page** offers customers tailor-made inspiration and advice based on individual preferences.\n\n\u2014 **Stylestory** is a creative tool enabling customers to express and share their favourite styles with other customers, who in turn can discover and shop directly for the styles that inspire them.\n\n\u2014 **Smart mirrors** are being tested in COS fitting rooms in the US. The mirrors recognise products brought into the room and can offer personalised product and styling recommendations.\n\n\u2014 **Buy online, pick-up in store** allows customers to shop online from the assortment in a physical store and pick up the purchase in store.\nDemand-driven supply chain\n\nCustomer demand-driven production .................. 37\nTowards recycled, regenerative and responsibly sourced materials ........................................ 40\nReducing greenhouse gas emissions .................. 42\nFair jobs and positive social impacts .................. 43\nLogistics and distribution ............................... 44\nPackaging ........................................... 45\nCustomer demand-driven production\n\nWe continuously engage with our customers to meet and exceed their needs and expectations, so we can offer them unbeatable value with the best combination of fashion, quality, price and sustainability.\n\nLong-term investments and close relationships with our suppliers enable an efficient and demand-driven supply chain, which can react quickly to trends and ever-changing customer demands \u2014 all to ensure we deliver the best customer offering and experience across all sales channels at the right time.\n\nOur value chain includes the full range of activities required to plan, design, source, process and manufacture, transport, sell, use, reuse and recycle our products. The part of the value chain that covers production, logistics and distribution is our supply chain.\n\nWe continue to make long-term investments in our supply chain to optimise the flow of goods with a focus on maximising customer satisfaction, while minimising negative environmental and social impacts. Speed, availability, cost efficiency and accuracy are decisive key factors for achieving this. By using AI and data across the whole supply chain, we can ensure better precision in our quantification, allocation, pricing, personalisation and local relevance \u2014 contributing to leaner production and a more sustainable use of resources.\n\nAs a global company it is vital to have an efficient and demand-driven supply chain that enables us to quickly adjust volumes, sales channels and markets based on changes in customer demand and unexpected events. Our new distribution systems and highly automated logistics centres are an important part of our work to reduce lead times and optimise the customer experience.\n\nOur supply chain is built on long-term strategic partnerships, mutual trust and fair purchasing practices. We maintain a close dialogue with our suppliers through our production offices located in the different sourcing markets. Together, we continually work on improving our products and addressing environmental and social impacts in our supply chain.\n\nWe have invested in Global Startup Award winner Smartex, and are now using its innovative AI technology to identify faults during production. By avoiding unnecessary production of faulty yarn and fabric, we improve resource efficiency.\nA large part of our environmental footprint occurs in the supply chain \u2014 particularly in fabric manufacturing and processes like dyeing and washing, which are often energy- and water-intensive. In 2022, we launched our Water Strategy 2030, developed with input from brands, NGOs, water experts and key suppliers in each region. The strategy focuses on our absolute water use rather than measuring water efficiency, to clearly decouple growth from resource use. We also continued investing in Colorifix and Alchemie, start-ups that have developed dyeing processes that use less water, chemicals and energy than conventional processes. These processes have already been used for some of our collections. We will continue working with our suppliers and other partners to improve resource efficiency and protect water availability, while creating a more circular, resilient and demand-driven supply chain.\n\nOur new Reverse Supply Chain function focuses on retrieving garments from our customers and materials from our suppliers, feeding them back into our supply chain as valuable resources. To demonstrate the potential for recycling blended fibres, we have supported the installation of Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel\u2019s (HKRITA) Green Machine at one of our Indonesian suppliers. The supplier will use its own and other companies\u2019 production leftovers as feedstock for the process.\nTowards recycled, regenerative and responsibly sourced materials\n\nOur industry is heavily reliant on materials. Therefore, it is vital to choose, create demand for and innovative materials with lower negative impact \u2014 alongside working to reduce our overall resource use and decouple it from business growth.\n\nOur goal is for 100 percent of our materials to be either recycled or sourced in a more sustainable way by 2030 (in 2022 we achieved 84 percent). A milestone toward this goal is to achieve 30 percent recycled materials by 2025.\n\nWe have set a new long-term materials vision to move towards a resilient and circular material sector that stays within planetary boundaries, enhances livelihoods and thrives on innovations. Our vision is built on three pillars:\n\n\u2014 **Recycled**: prioritise post-consumer closed-loop recycled materials that have the potential to be reused and recycled again.\n\n\u2014 **Regenerative**: use key virgin raw materials produced using regenerative agricultural practices that help improve soil health and enhance livelihoods and ecosystems.\n\n\u2014 **Responsible**: source materials with the overall aim to reduce environmental impact, respect human rights and protect animal welfare. This is the foundation of all our sourcing decisions.\n\nBy investing in, developing and scaling production of innovative materials, recycling innovations, technology and infrastructure, we get greater access to the materials, which can also mitigate future risks connected to resource scarcity and help reduce our negative impact on the planet. Our aim with investments goes beyond achieving our sustainability goals and supporting the long-term growth of H&M Group \u2014 we look for investments and technologies that the entire industry can benefit from.\n\nTwo examples of innovative companies we have invested in over the years and that keep scaling up are Renewcell and Infinited Fiber Company \u2014 both using garment recycling technologies to produce their materials Circulose\u00ae and Infinna\u2122. We were not only one of the first companies to start offering garments made of these innovative materials, but we have signed a multi-year agreement to secure future access to them.\n\nWe have invested in Materra\u2122, which has developed a technology to grow cotton that has the potential to increase yields and fibre quality, while minimising water and pesticide use. Our Circular Innovation Lab worked with Materra to set up a pilot in India, with the first crop yield harvested at the end of 2022 for use in collections by COS.\nThe ability to recirculate resources again and again, maintaining quality and minimising impact, is a key step towards reaching a circular fashion industry. This is why supporting new recycling technologies is a strategic continuation of our in-store collecting initiative for used garments and home textiles, from any brand and in any condition, to be reused and recycled.\n\nRead more about how we work with material choices in our sustainability disclosures.\n\nH&M Group was recognised as one of 47 leading companies out of 292 analysed in the Textile Exchange 2021 Material Change Leaderboard. We were one of 16 companies identified as leading on circularity and one of 17 companies identified as leading on progress against the Sustainable Development Goals.\nReducing greenhouse gas emissions\n\nOur climate goal is to reduce our absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 56 percent by 2030, against a 2019 baseline. Our long-term goal is to reach net-zero by 2040. These goals were verified in 2022 by the Science Based Targets initiative.\n\nTo reach our goals, we ultimately need to reduce our overall resource use by creating products our customers want, made with lower-impact materials and processes. We are investing in projects to reduce GHG throughout our whole value chain. So far, we have invested in more than 20 projects focusing on increasing our share of more sustainable materials and renewable energy, phasing out coal, advancing energy efficiency and enabling carbon removals, where return on investment is measured by GHG emission reductions, not financial gain. For example, we launched the Green Fashion Initiative to help our suppliers become more energy efficient and transition away from fossil fuels. We are also a lead investor in the Fashion Climate Fund, which is designed to drive collective action to tackle supply chain GHG emissions. In January 2022, we stopped onboarding new supplier factories with on-site coal boilers.\n\nIn support of our overall climate goals, we aim to source 100 percent renewable electricity in both our own operations and our supply chain by 2030. We have signed agreements with developers of new solar farms to secure renewable energy for many years to come. This will not only help us reduce our GHG emissions, but also secure our energy prices and increase the amount of new renewable electricity generation added to electrical grids. We have also set up internal carbon pricing to influence our decisions about which materials, production processes and transport modes to use, helping us reduce GHG emissions.\n\nEven after the greatest possible reduction of GHG emissions across our value chain, a certain percentage of unavoidable emissions will remain. Therefore, we also invest in solutions to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In 2022, we signed a multi-year carbon removal agreement with Climeworks, which covers the removal of 10,000 tons of carbon dioxide via direct air capture and storage technology. We also joined the LEAF Coalition (Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance) \u2014 a public-private initiative that focuses on mobilising large-scale financing to countries committed to making ambitious reductions in tropical deforestation.\n\nBy continuing to collaborate, innovate and invest in transitioning toward a circular fashion industry, we will further decrease the amount of virgin resources and energy intensive processes we use and thereby reduce our GHG emissions.\n\nRead more about how we work with reducing GHG emissions in our sustainability disclosure.\n\nOur sustainability-linked bond, which was issued in 2021, continues to provide an opportunity for investors to support, among other things, an accelerated transition to recycled materials and reduction of GHG emissions (scope 1, 2 and 3) in our supply chain.\n\n1) Excluding use-phase emissions.\nFair jobs and positive social impacts\n\nAll people involved in our value chain are essential to our business, and it\u2019s our responsibility to respect their rights, driven by our values and commitment to be a fair and equal company. Our tier 1 and 2 production supply chains alone contribute to the employment of around 1.3 million people. We work to advance the human rights and working conditions of everyone working across our value chain, while also supporting them to know their rights.\n\nWe focus on supporting decent jobs with fair compensation and benefits in safe, secure workplaces free from discrimination, where workers have a voice, equal opportunities to develop, and freedom of association is respected.\n\nOur work is aligned with the International Labour Organization\u2019s (ILO) Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and is informed by the ILO\u2019s definition of decent work, our Human Rights Policy and the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights, among others. We require all business partners to comply with our Sustainability Commitment and sign our Code of Ethics, and we continuously conduct stringent due diligence of our supply chains. As part of this, we assess not only our salient human rights issues on an annual basis, but also the long-term risks and impacts for different parts of our operations and value chain \u2014 such as what a shift to a net-zero and circular fashion industry could mean for future work across our value chain.\n\nOur work on wages in our supply chain was assessed as \u201cadvanced\u201d, the second highest category, in the Platform Living Wage Financials 2022 Annual Report. Besides H&M Group, only one more retailer in the garment and footwear sector was included in this category. Also, our work on data collection and impact on the ground were highlighted as best practice.\n\nOur business impacts people all over the world, and we want to ensure that impact is positive. We recognise the interconnectedness between environmental issues \u2014 such as climate change, resource use and water scarcity \u2014 and social impacts affecting equity, health and livelihoods. Together with our suppliers and other partners, we can accelerate positive impact for millions of people and their communities \u2014 as well as reducing environmental impacts. At the same time, we can further improve resource efficiency and skill sets, and help bring about a just transition to a circular economy, while creating a demand-driven and resilient supply chain.\n\nRead more about how we work with social impact in our sustainability disclosure.\nLogistics and distribution\n\nOur holistic approach to continuously meeting our customers\u2019 demands while ensuring we limit negative environmental and social impact also applies to our logistics and distribution centres. Together with our investments within tech and AI, these centres are an important part of our omni-model.\n\nWe are innovating across our global network by developing new, highly automated logistics centres. These are designed to create additional capacity, flexibility and speed between sales channels, enabling improved availability. For example, in the first half of 2023 a new logistics centre in Ajax, Canada is scheduled to start its operations, supplementing those recently opened on the US East and West Coasts. These new highly automated facilities create further capacity for our continued expansion in North America.\n\nWe maintain constant focus on optimised transport solutions to deliver on our customers\u2019 expectations, while taking action to reduce our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We select equipment that optimises efficiency, and fill transport units to their maximum level to reduce the number of units required. Across all modes of transport, and with the support of our transport service providers, we are committed to tracking and analysing data to measure progress and secure a future reduction in our GHG emissions.\n\nIn some markets, our online customers can choose from a range of preferred delivery options such as receive and return items using a bicycle delivery service, electric vehicles or by foot. This, in combination with using biogas, Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) and electric vehicles from the logistics centre, help to reduce GHG emissions compared to conventional delivery options. We are continually testing and developing new options, as well as scaling initiatives to more markets.\n\nWe work solely with ocean carriers that are verified in accordance with Clean Cargo Working Group protocol. Air freight makes up less than one percent of our inbound volumes, and we are active members of BSR\u2019s Sustainable Air Freight Alliance, which drives the environmental agenda to reduce GHG emissions and promote responsible transports. We have also created frameworks for the design and construction of new distribution centres, focusing on employee wellbeing as well as reducing pollution and waste, using renewable energy and supporting biodiversity.\nPackaging\n\nOur products need to be protected during their journeys between our suppliers, distribution centres, stores and customers, to prevent damage and waste. We are committed to lowering the environmental impact of our packing, guided by our Circular Packing Strategy, built on the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF)\u2019s key principles: eliminate, circulate and regenerate.\n\nWe prioritise areas where we are most likely to have the greatest impact, including reducing unnecessary and problematic packaging like hangers and plastic bags. One of our goals is to make 100 percent of packaging from recycled or more sustainably sourced materials, with a preference for post-consumer recycled materials. In 2022, we worked to optimise the size and weight of the FSC-certified paper online packaging bags that replaced single-use plastic bags for all our brands and markets.\n\nRead more about our work toward achieving our packing goals in our sustainability disclosure.\nOur approach to sustainability\n\nSustainability \u2013 integrated in our business ........... 47\nKey sustainability goals .................................. 49\nSustainability \u2013 integrated in our business\n\nH&M Group has a long history of actively working with sustainability. This goes back to our majority owners, the Persson family, having a long-term perspective and genuine interest in how we as a company can contribute to a more sustainable fashion industry.\n\nOur values and our commitment to offering our customers fashion and quality at the best price in a more sustainable way, have guided us throughout the years, and continue to do so every day.\n\nSustainability is business critical, not only to fulfil our business idea, but also to meet evolving customer expectations and to ensure we future proof our business. Sustainability is therefore an integral part of our business, which means that each brand, retail market, production market and group function works to drive performance towards both our business and sustainability goals. The importance and value of our sustainability work for our business is further underlined in our 2030 goal, which combine targets for company growth and profit with greenhouse gas emissions reduction.\n\nInvestments in sustainability provide the group with long-term business opportunities. By building strategic partnerships with key stakeholders and growing in different innovative ways such as circular business models, we can continue to offer our customers unbeatable value and access to a more sustainable lifestyle, while supporting the transition towards a circular, net-zero fashion industry.\n\nOur vision is to lead the change towards achieving a circular fashion industry with net-zero climate impact, while being a fair and equal company. This guides us in how we play our part in tackling climate change, supporting biodiversity, avoiding natural resource depletion and reducing social inequality. These and other risks to our business, the planet and people connected to our value chain are all interlinked, and to achieve our vision, we have defined a wide range of detailed strategies, policies and goals that are further explained in our sustainability disclosure.\nLEAD THE CHANGE\n\n\u2014 Scale innovation\n\u2014 Promote transparency\n\u2014 Collaborate for industrywide progress\n\nSUPPORT A CIRCULAR FASHION INDUSTRY WITH NET-ZERO CLIMATE IMPACT\n\n\u2014 Become net-zero across our value chain by 2040, operating within planetary boundaries\n\u2014 Have a net positive impact on biodiversity\n\u2014 Scale circular models and systems for our products, supply chains and customer journeys\n\nBE A FAIR AND EQUAL COMPANY\n\n\u2014 Have a positive impact on all people across our value chain\n\u2014 Support and promote inclusion and diversity in everything we do\n\nRESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS\nKey sustainability goals\n\nWe have set ambitious sustainability goals, which to the greatest possible extent are based on latest science, best practice and knowledge. To achieve them, we need to work closely together with our suppliers and partners.\n\nCollaboration helps us progress towards our ambitions faster than we could alone. It also aids innovation and industrywide progress, as we learn from each other and work towards shared goals. Some of our key goals and our performance against them are presented in this report, and more detailed information can be found in our sustainability disclosure.\n\nClimate\n\n**2030:** Reduce absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 56 percent (baseline 2019).\n\n**Achievement 2022:** 8 percent reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions and 7 percent reduction in scope 3 emissions (from 2019 baseline).\n\nPackaging\n\n**2030:** Make 100 percent of packaging from recycled or other more sustainably sourced materials, with a preference for post-consumer recycled materials.\n\n**Achievement 2022:** 85 percent\n\n**2025:** 25 percent reduction in plastic packaging (baseline 2018)\n\n**Achievement 2022:** 44 percent\n\nWater\n\n**2030:** Reduce absolute total freshwater use by 30 percent (baseline 2022).\n\n**2025:** Reduce absolute total freshwater use by 10 percent (baseline 2022).\n\n**Achievement 2022:** Above goals for 2025 and 2030 are part of our new water strategy. Therefore, our achieved result in 2022 relates to our previous strategy. We reduced the relative production water usage by 38 percent, compared to 2017 baseline (driven by a 21% water recycling rate and 21% improvement in relative water efficiency).\n\nMaterials and resources\n\n**2030:** 100 percent of our materials in commercial goods to be either recycled or other more sustainably sourced materials.\n\n**Achievement 2022:** 84 percent\n\n**2025:** 30 percent of our materials in commercial goods to be certified recycled.\n\n**Achievement 2022:** 23 percent\n\n1) Excluding use-phase emissions.\nInnovation and collaboration\n\nInnovation ........................................... 51\nCollaboration and partnership ....................... 52\nWe see an urgent imperative and a huge opportunity to continue changing how we operate and to partner with others in our industry to accelerate systemic change.\n\nWe use our size and influence to initiate and accelerate the transformations required such as identifying, testing, investing in and attempting to scale innovative materials and technologies that have the potential to drive radical shifts in how we make and remake our products, and how our customers can access and experience fashion. All this will further improve the resilience of our business and supply chain and is crucial for the journey towards a net-zero, circular fashion industry. Our investments in innovations also support our commitment to respect human rights by contributing to more favourable environmental conditions for communities and people.\n\nOur work includes exploring new solutions and opportunities through our innovation hub H&M Group Laboratory, and we test new business models and partnerships to scale through our business ventures. To complement our innovations and ideas within the company, we also find, support and invest in innovative start-ups. This enables us to drive innovation and explore more opportunities faster than what would be possible without these strong relationships with leading entrepreneurs. H&M Foundation\u2019s Global Change Awards \u2014 the world\u2019s largest innovation challenge \u2014 finds, supports and scales early-stage ideas. Our Circular Innovation Lab supports proof-of-concept projects to test and evaluate technologies\u2019 suitability for H&M Group, with the purpose to scale and ease integration into our organisation and supply chain.\n\nThrough our investment arm H&M CO:LAB, we support start-ups with capital and knowledge. Today, we have one of the industry\u2019s largest portfolios. Although all our investments are long-term, they have in a short time created significant value both financially and operationally \u2014 for example by improving customer experience and enabling scaling and commercialisation of recycled and more sustainably sourced materials.\n\nWe have a long-standing collaboration with Fairbrics, winner of H&M Foundation\u2019s Global Change Award and now part of our investment arm\u2019s portfolio. The company has developed a technology to capture carbon dioxide, which is converted into the building blocks for polyester. This material has already been used in a proof-of-concept t-shirt for H&M and is currently under development for H&M Move pieces.\nCollaboration and partnership\n\nLong-term strategic collaborations and partnerships are crucial not only to accelerate innovation and reach our goals, but also to tackle complex and interconnected challenges in the industry that require a shared commitment to progress.\n\nWe welcome an open and constructive dialogue and collaboration with others within and outside our industry. By exchanging diverse perspectives, we are challenged to do better and stay relevant so that we can keep providing our customers with unbeatable value and new ways to enjoy fashion. Dialogue drives transparency, which is a prerequisite for accountability. By engaging with policymakers, we also help shape a legislative environment that will support a more sustainable fashion sector of the future.\n\nWe collaborate with our business partners, experts, innovators, challengers, customers, communities, policymakers and many more. Our stakeholders also represent or are themselves rights holders, and the actions we take as a business have the potential to impact their human rights positively or negatively.\n\nRead more about our memberships and collaborations.\nStatutory annual report\n\nCorporate governance report 2022 .................. 55\nAdministration report ................................ 73\n\u2014 Statutory Sustainability Report .................. 86\n\u2014 TCFD climate risk analysis ....................... 103\n\nFinancial reports .................................... 108\n\u2014 Group income statement ......................... 108\n\u2014 Consolidated statement of comprehensive income .................. 108\n\u2014 Group balance sheet .............................. 110\n\u2014 Group changes in equity ......................... 112\n\u2014 Group cash flow statement ...................... 113\n\n\u2014 Parent company income statement ............. 114\n\u2014 Parent company statement of comprehensive income .................. 114\n\u2014 Parent company balance sheet .................. 115\n\u2014 Parent company changes in equity ............. 116\n\u2014 Parent company cash flow statement .......... 117\n\nNotes to the financial statements .................. 118\n\nSigning of the annual report ....................... 141\nAuditor\u2019s report ..................................... 142\nSound corporate governance ensures that companies are managed as sustainably, responsibly, and efficiently as possible in the interests of their shareholders.\n\nAt H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (H&M) this means compliance with external regulations and that, values, global policies, and guidelines are important tools. The Code of Ethics, which is signed by all colleagues who interact with business partners, clearly states the approach of H&M when doing business. H&M operates in many markets that have different challenges, and where laws, environmental requirements and social conditions may differ. These varied contexts underline the importance of acting consistently and with a strong ethical compass.\n\nH & M Hennes & Mauritz AB is a Swedish public limited company. H&M\u2019s class B share is listed on Nasdaq Stockholm.\n\nH&M has applied the Swedish Corporate Governance Code (the Code) since 2005. The Code is based on the principle of \u201ccomply or explain\u201d, which means that companies applying the Code may deviate from individual rules provided they give an explanation of the deviation, describe the chosen alternative and provide the reasons for the deviation. The code is available at corporategovernanceboard.se.\n\nThis report, which covers the financial year 1 December 2021 to 30 November 2022 \u2014 hereafter referred to as the 2022 financial year \u2014 was prepared in accordance with the Code and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act by the company\u2019s board of directors. It has been reviewed by the company\u2019s auditors.\n\nExternal and internal governance\nH&M is governed both by external regulations and internal control documents.\n\nExamples of external regulations are:\n\n\u2014 Accounting legislation including the Swedish Bookkeeping Act and Annual Accounts Act\n\u2014 MAR \u2014 the EU Market Abuse Regulation\n\u2014 Nasdaq Stockholm Rules for Issuers\n\u2014 The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\n\u2014 The Swedish Companies Act\n\u2014 The Swedish Corporate Governance Code (the Code)\n\nExamples of internal control documents:\n\n\u2014 Articles of association\n\u2014 Code of Ethics\n\u2014 Communications Policy\n\u2014 Financial Policy\n\u2014 Human Rights Policy\n\u2014 Insider Policy\n\u2014 Our Way\n\u2014 Sustainability Commitment\n\u2014 Tax Policy\n\u2014 The board\u2019s rule of procedure including instructions for the CEO and audit committee\n\u2014 Whistleblowing Policy\n\nH&M\u2019s corporate governance is furthermore based on the company\u2019s values, which encompass a sound, simple, straightforward, cost-conscious, entrepreneurial corporate culture that focuses on teamwork, belief in people and constant improvement. Sustainability is part of H&M\u2019s business idea and is integrated into all parts of the business.\n\nFor more information read page 86.\nEthics, transparency, and risk management\nAs a global company, it is of the utmost importance for H&M to always act ethically, transparently, and responsibly in all parts of the business \u2014 from collaborating with our suppliers to meeting with customers. Through good purchasing routines and close cooperation with suppliers, the company\u2019s products should always be produced with the greatest possible consideration for people and environment. H&M\u2019s risk management and internal control processes ensure we are compliant, and act on things that makes a difference, throughout the organisation. The board of directors and the audit committee receive regular feedback from the organisation concerning these processes.\n\nH&M\u2019s risks are reviewed centrally on a quarterly basis with each brand and every central function. The quarterly meetings are conducted in order to ensure each listed risk has an action plan to minimise impact and is kept at an acceptable risk level. This risk management work also provides continuous input to the company\u2019s long-term commercial decisions.\n\nResponsibility for management and control is shared between the company\u2019s shareholders, the board, the audit committee, and the CEO. The board\u2019s rule of procedure states how this work is to be distributed between the board, the board\u2019s audit committee and the CEO. The board is ultimately responsible for the company\u2019s organisation and administration and the CEO is responsible for ongoing management of the business, with regular feedback to the board.\n\nBoard members and 2022 meetings\nThe board of directors has eight members elected by the annual general meeting (AGM), four women and four men, and three employee representatives and three deputies for these appointed by employee organisations in accordance with Swedish law. In total, the board has 14 members \u2013 eight women and six men.\n\nThe composition of the board exhibits breadth and diversity, with the board members\u2019 different areas of expertise complementing each other well. Their experience in areas such as retail, entrepreneurship, fashion, digitalisation, AI, advanced analytics and automation, sustainability and communication forms a good basis for deep and nurturing discussions with the CEO and management.\n\nDuring 2022 the board held 11 board meetings, including a statutory meeting in conjunction with the AGM. Attendance has been very high at all the meetings. The CEO, CFO and chief accountant also attend all the meetings. Generally, one or two departments or brands are invited to each meeting to give a status presentation concerning what their particular function or brand is working on. These presentations act as a complement to the CEO\u2019s status reports and provide opportunity for more in-depth discussions concerning specific areas of the operations. At each board meeting the chair of the audit committee also give a summary of the matters addressed by the audit committee at its most recent meeting within areas such as accounting, audit, security, tax, internal control, and risk, as well as various new regulations and legislation.\n\nFurther reading\nRead more about H&M\u2019s corporate governance at hmgroup.com/corporategovernance.\n\nHere you will find, among other things:\n\u2014 Articles of association\n\u2014 Information about the board of directors, CEO, auditors and audit committee\n\u2014 Information about standards and policies\n\u2014 Information and material from previous AGMs and Extraordinary General Meetings\n\u2014 Information on the nomination committee\n\u2014 Previous corporate governance reports\n\u2014 Risks and uncertainties\n\nH & M Hennes & Mauritz AB has chosen to have the corporate governance report as a separate document to the annual report, in accordance with chapter 6 section 8 of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act. The information that must be provided under chapter 6 section 6 items 3-6 of the Annual Accounts Act is included on page 80 of the H&M Group Annual and Sustainability Report for 2022 and is therefore not included in this corporate governance report. In accordance with chapter 6 section 9 of the Annual Accounts Act, the company\u2019s auditors have issued a statement on the corporate governance report that can be found on page 72.\n\nDuring the financial year 2022 H&M did not deviate from the Code.\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE IN SWEDEN\nListed companies in Sweden must be aware of the following aspects of corporate governance:\n\n\u2014 The nomination committee plays a key role and, in contrast to the Anglo-American system, its members are appointed by a company\u2019s largest shareholders. It is the nomination committee\u2019s task to propose the size of the board of directors and to propose who is to be elected to the board at the general meeting of shareholders. Board members are elected by all those who vote at the general meeting. In practice, therefore, the nomination committee has a decisive influence over who is elected to the board. The nomination committee also provides the general meeting with a proposal of board fees and a proposed auditor. Instructions for how members of the nomination committee are appointed are decided by the general meeting.\n\n\u2014 Swedish law states that board members are appointed to represent the interests of all shareholders. Hence if a large shareholder group has proposed a new member via the nomination committee, that board member represents the interests of all shareholders and not only the interests of the shareholder(s) that nominated her/him.\n\n\u2014 For many decades, Swedish enterprise in general has favoured the CEO and other board members in a company elected by its general meeting owning shares in the company. This is seen as a guarantee that the interests of the board are aligned with the interests of all shareholders with respect to a positively increasing share price and that there is consensus regarding the company\u2019s risks and opportunities.\n\n\u2014 Neither the Swedish Corporate Governance Code nor the Swedish Companies Act impose any restrictions on the age of board members or how long members may sit on the board or prescribe any time limit for when an independent board member ceases to be independent of the company or its principal owners.\n\n\u2014 The Swedish Corporate Governance Code stipulates that at least one of the company\u2019s auditors is to attend the AGM and it is common practice in Sweden for a company\u2019s chief auditor to attend the AGM. The auditors are deemed to be the general meeting\u2019s control body for the board.\n\nAs a result, shareholders can pose questions to the auditors at the AGM irrespective of the size of their shareholding.\n\n\u2014 The option of having different classes of shares \u2014 usually known as \u201cclass A / B / C\u201d etc. shares, usually with differing voting rights, and sometimes with a difference in rights to dividends \u2014 has been present in the Swedish Companies Act for a long time and is widely used.\n\n\u2014 By law, employees have the right to appoint employee representatives to the board of larger companies. All board members are invited to the same meetings and receive the same information, and the employee-elected members have the same voting rights as members elected by the general meeting. Board fees are paid only to members elected by the general meeting.\n\nH&M\u2019s corporate governance structure\nH&M\u2019s corporate governance structure encompasses shareholders, the board of directors, the audit committee, the CEO, the nomination committee, the auditors, the executive management team, business areas organised by brand, employees, and employee organisations. H&M\u2019s shareholders ultimately decide the company\u2019s direction since the shareholders at the general meeting appoint the board of directors and the chair of the board. Proposals for the composition of the board, board fees and the election of auditors are prepared in advance by the nomination committee. The board in turn appoints a CEO to take care of day-to-day administration. The CEO appoints members of the executive management team within H&M\u2019s matrix organisation. The board includes three employee representatives, each of whom has a deputy, and all of whom are appointed by their respective employee organisations. The board appoints an audit committee from among its members, which deals with accounting and auditing matters on an ongoing basis and is the main channel of communication between the board and the auditors. Each year the auditors\u2019 report their findings to the board of directors and to the AGM.\n1. SHAREHOLDERS AND ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\n\nThe shareholders of H&M have the final decision on the company\u2019s governance. Shareholders vote at the general meeting to adopt the articles of association, which determine what the business will focus on, and to appoint the board of directors and its chair, whose task it is to administer the company\u2019s affairs on behalf of the shareholders. The shareholders at the general meeting also elect auditors, decide on the composition of and instructions for the nomination committee. The general meeting is thus the company\u2019s highest decision-making body and is the forum in which shareholders exercise their right to decide on the company\u2019s affairs. H&M\u2019s annual general meeting (AGM) is held once a year, in late April or early May.\n\nThe date and venue are announced in conjunction with H&M\u2019s nine-month report as well as at hmgroup.com. The notice of the meeting is published four to six weeks before the meeting as a press release and in the newspaper Post- och Inrikes Tidningar and at hmgroup.com. Publication of the notice is announced by an advertisement placed in the newspapers Dagens Nyheter and Svenska Dagbladet. Shareholders registered directly in the register of shareholders who have given notice of their attendance on time, are entitled to participate in the meeting and vote for the total numbers of shares that they hold. Shareholders who cannot be present in person may be represented by proxy.\n\nShareholders wishing to have a particular matter considered by the meeting may submit a written request to the board at least seven weeks before the meeting. An email address to H&M is also provided in the press release for the notice of the meeting, for shareholders who wish to submit their questions in advance. All the material belonging to the meeting, including the minutes of the meeting, is available on the company\u2019s website in both Swedish and English. Extraordinary general meetings can also be held when there is a particular need to do so.\n\nShareholders\u2019 decision-making powers\n\nAmong other things, the general meeting makes decisions concerning:\n\n\u2014 The election of board members and the chair of the board\n\u2014 Board fees, including the compensation paid to members for work on the audit committee\n\u2014 Discharge of the members of the board and the CEO from liability\n\u2014 Amendments to the articles of association\n\u2014 The election of the auditor\n\u2014 The adoption of the income statement and balance sheet\n\u2014 The distribution of the earnings for the past financial year\n\u2014 The resolution on composition of and instructions for the nomination committee\n\u2014 Guidelines for remuneration to senior executives\n\nArticles of association\n\nAccording to the H&M articles of association, H&M\u2019s board of directors is to consist of at least three and no more than 12 members elected by the general meeting and no more than the same number of deputies. The AGM decides the exact number of board members and which individuals are to be elected to the board. Board members are elected for the period until the close of the next AGM. The general meeting also decides on amendments to the articles of association.\n\nAnnual general meeting 2022\n\nH&M\u2019s AGM 2022 was held on 4 May as a digital meeting in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 14 and 15 of the Swedish Act (2022:121) on temporary exemptions to facilitate the holding of general meetings of companies and associations. This meant \u2013 among other things \u2013 that the shareholders were able to exercise their voting rights at the general meeting by participating digitally (online) or by postal voting. A digital tool allowed those attending the meeting remotely to ask questions.\n\nThe company appeared on video from a venue at H&M\u2019s head office. A total of 909 shareholders were represented at the meeting, representing 87.8 percent of the votes and 75.0 percent of the capital.\n\nThe main resolutions passed were the following:\n\n\u2014 The lawyer Sven Unger was elected as chair of the meeting.\n\u2014 Balance sheets and income statements for H&M and for the group were adopted.\n\u2014 Dividend was to be paid to the shareholders in two instalments, with record date for the first payment on 6 May 2022 (SEK 3.25 per share) and record date for the second payment on 11 November 2022 (SEK 3.25 per share). The remainder of the company\u2019s earnings was to be carried forward.\n\u2014 The board members and the CEO were discharged from liability for the 2020/2021 financial year.\n\u2014 The number of board members elected by the meeting to serve until the close of the next AGM was set at eight, with no deputies.\n\u2014 The following ordinary board members were re-elected: Stina Bergfors, Anders Dahlvig, Danica Kragic Jensfelt, Lena Patriksson Keller, Christian Sievert, Erica Wiking H\u00e4ger, Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m and Karl-Johan Persson.\n\u2014 Karl-Johan Persson was re-elected as the chair of the board.\n\u2014 The board fees proposed by the nomination committee were approved as follows: chair of the board SEK 1,800,000; board members elected by the AGM SEK 775,000; members of the audit committee an additional SEK 200,000; and the chair of the audit committee an additional SEK 280,000.\n\u2014 Deloitte AB was appointed as the auditor until the close of the 2023 AGM. Auditors\u2019 fees to be paid based on approved invoices.\n\u2014 Resolution on composition of and instructions for the nomination committee were approved.\n\u2014 A resolution was passed, which authorised the board to make decisions concerning purchase of own Series B shares on as many occasions as it deems appropriate in the period up to the 2023 AGM for a total amount not exceeding SEK 3 billion.\n\u2014 A resolution on the amendment of the articles of association was passed.\n\nVotes and capital represented at H&M\u2019s annual general meeting:\n\n| YEAR | % OF VOTES | % OF CAPITAL |\n|------|------------|--------------|\n| 2017 | 83.7       | 66.6         |\n| 2018 | 82.3       | 63.6         |\n| 2019 | 84.6       | 68.4         |\n| 2020 | 86.7       | 72.7         |\n| 2021 | 87.8       | 74.9         |\n| 2022 | 87.8       | 75.0         |\n\nNumber of shareholders and ownership structure\nAt the end of the financial year, H&M had 254,495 shareholders. The total number of shares in H&M is 1,655,072,000, of which 194,400,000 are class A shares with ten votes per share and 1,460,672,000 are class B shares with one vote per share.\n\nH&M\u2019s largest shareholder is Stefan Persson and family, who via Ramsbury Invest AB hold all the class A shares, which represent 57.1 percent of the votes, as well as 653,093,901 (604,856,427) class B shares, representing 19.2 (17.8) percent of the votes. In addition, the family privately own 36,400,289 class B shares. This means that as of 30 November 2022, Stefan Persson and family privately and via Ramsbury Invest AB represent 77.3 (75.9) percent of the votes and 53.4 (50.5) percent of the total number of shares. Ramsbury Invest is thus formally the parent company of H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB. Ramsbury Invest AB is owned by Stefan Persson and family, and primarily by Stefan Persson. Karl-Johan Persson is also a shareholder in Ramsbury Invest AB.\n\nA class A share has greater voting power at the company\u2019s general meetings. All the shares have the same dividend entitlement and right to share in the company\u2019s assets. Since the company was first listed on the stock exchange in 1974, all the class A shares in H&M have belonged to the founding Persson family. This is usual when family-owned businesses are floated on the stock exchange, since it allows the founding family to have a controlling interest. The division into class A and class B shares is set out in H&M\u2019s articles of association, providing transparency to those considering buying shares in H&M.\n\nAnnual general meeting 2023\nH&M\u2019s AGM 2023 will be held on Thursday, 4 May 2023.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE\nThe nomination committee prepares information that will be used as a basis for decisions at the general meeting concerning election of the board of directors, chair of the board, auditors and chair of the annual general meeting, fees to the board and auditors, as well as instructions for the nomination committee. The nomination committee\u2019s proposal for the composition of the board exhibits diversity and breadth as regards expertise, experience, background and gender balance. It also takes into consideration the company\u2019s stage of development and future focus.\n\nBefore each annual general meeting the nomination committee\u2019s report is available to read as a separate document at hmgroup.com/corporategovernance. The composition of the nomination committee is based on the instructions for the composition of the nomination committee adopted at the 2022 AGM. The nomination committee is, in accordance with the instruction, appointed based on the principle that the nomination committee is to consist of the chair of the board plus four others nominated by the four largest\nshareholders in terms of voting rights, as recorded in the register of shareholders on the last banking day in August. In autumn 2022 the nomination committee thus consisted of:\n\n\u2014 Karl-Johan Persson, chair of the board\n\u2014 Stefan Persson, Ramsbury Invest AB\n\u2014 Lottie Tham\n\u2014 Joachim Spetz, Swedbank Robur Fonder\n\u2014 Karin Eliasson, Handelsbanken Fonder\n\nThe nomination committee meets the requirements of the Code regarding the independence of members. Stefan Persson chairs the nomination committee, in accordance with the rules in the nomination committee\u2019s instructions which state that the chair of the nomination committee shall be the member representing the largest shareholder unless the nomination committee appoints another person. The nomination committee unanimously decided that in view of H&M\u2019s ownership structure, Stefan Persson in his capacity as principal shareholder is the natural choice to chair H&M\u2019s nomination committee.\n\nWork of the nomination committee in preparation for the 2022 AGM, including description of diversity policy for the board of directors\n\nBefore the 2022 AGM the nomination committee held two meetings at which minutes were taken and was also in contact at other times. As a basis for its work to analyse the composition of the board ahead of the 2022 AGM, the nomination committee studied the report by the chair of the board on the work of the board of directors and also met on one occasion with CEO Helena Helmersson. The board\u2019s work has functioned well over the course of the year. The information from the chair of the board, along with interviews conducted with the board members elected by the general meeting, provided a basis for the nomination committee\u2019s work on its proposal to the 2022 AGM regarding the composition of the board. The board members\u2019 different competencies complement each other well, which contributes to a good whole. In view of the pandemic and the fact that other external factors remained challenging, the board has had considerably more meetings than normal. All the members attended all the board meetings and showed great commitment, both at and between the meetings. The nomination committee\u2019s judgment ahead of the 2022 AGM was therefore that the board works well together as a team and, in view of this, the nomination committee chose to prioritise continuity in the board\u2019s work and decided not to propose any changes to the composition of the board.\n\nThe nomination committee\u2019s proposal to the 2022 AGM was therefore the re-election of all the sitting board members: Stina Bergfors, Anders Dahlvig, Danica Kragic Jensfelt, Lena Patriksson Keller, Karl-Johan Persson, Christian Sievert, Erica Wiking H\u00e4ger and Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m; and the re-election of Karl-Johan Persson as chair of the board.\n\nThe nomination committee judged that the proposed board complied well with section 4.1 of the Code, which the nomination committee applies as its diversity policy. The policy aims to ensure that the proposed board exhibits diversity and breadth of qualifications, experience and background, as well as gender balance, and H&M\u2019s board has had a good gender balance for many years. The board members proposed, and subsequently elected by the meeting, consisted of four women and four men. The board thus achieves the long-term ambition communicated by the Swedish Corporate Governance Board, which wants owners to speed up developments towards a share of around 40 percent for the less well represented gender on the boards of major listed companies.\n\nThe proposed board composition was considered to more than satisfy the requirements made of expertise and experience, taking into account the company\u2019s operations and future development. The proposal was considered to meet the applicable requirements well as regards the independence of board members, their stock market experience and their expertise in accounting and auditing.\n\nIn its proposal to the AGM the nomination committee carefully reviews each board member\u2019s expertise, experience, contribution to the work of the board over the past year, potential conflicts of interest etc. To decide whether a member is independent, an overall assessment is to be made of all circumstances that might cause the member\u2019s independence of the company and its management to be questioned. In rule 4.4 the Code states at least seven different circumstances that are to be considered here. At least two of the board members who are independent of the company and its management must also be independent of the company\u2019s major shareholders. To decide whether a board member is independent, the extent of the member\u2019s direct and indirect relationships with the major shareholder is to be included in the assessment. A board member who\nis employed by or is a board member in a company that is a major shareholder is not to be considered independent. As regards the composition of the audit committee, section 7.2 of the Code states that the majority of the committee\u2019s members are to be independent of the company and its management. At least one of the board members who are independent of the company and its management must also be independent of the company\u2019s major shareholders. The chair of H&M\u2019s audit committee, like all the other members of the committee, is independent of the company and its management. Two of the three members are also independent of the company\u2019s major shareholders. There is nothing in the Code stating that the chair of the committee must be independent of major shareholders.\n\nBetween the 2022 AGM and the end of the financial year the nomination committee held one meeting at which minutes were taken and was also in contact at other times. In autumn 2022 the nomination committee began its work, starting with information from the chair of the board concerning how well the work of the board has functioned during the year. During the autumn the nomination committee conducted interviews with board members elected by the general meeting. It was established that the board and its work are functioning well. In the period up until the proposals to the 2023 AGM are presented the nomination committee will discuss the size and composition of the board based on such factors as expertise, experience and the outlook for the company, the election of a chair of the board and of a chair for the general meeting, fees for board members, principles for the nomination committee and the election of auditors. The nomination committee\u2019s work in preparation for the AGM in May 2023 is not yet complete; more information will be presented before and at the 2023 AGM.\n\n3. AUDITORS\nThe auditors, who are independent and appointed by the shareholders at the AGM, scrutinise H&M\u2019s Annual and Sustainability Report, consolidated financial statements, accounts, and corporate governance report, and examine whether these have been prepared in accordance with current laws and recommendations. The auditors also scrutinise the management of H&M by the board and CEO, and review compliance with the guidelines on remuneration to senior executives adopted by the AGM.\n\nAt the 2022 AGM the accounting firm Deloitte AB (Deloitte) was elected as auditor of H&M for a one-year period of office, i.e., until the close of the 2023 AGM. Authorised public accountant Didrik Roos from Deloitte holds the main responsibility for the audit.\n\nAs previously, the 2022 AGM resolved that the auditors\u2019 fees should be paid based on invoices submitted and approved. The fees invoiced by the auditors over the past two financial years are reported in note 10 of the Annual and Sustainability Report for 2022.\n\nDeloitte is a member of a global network used for auditing assignments for most of the group\u2019s companies and meets H&M\u2019s requirements with respect to competence and geographical coverage. The auditors\u2019 independent status is guaranteed partly by legislation and professional ethics rules, partly by the accounting firm\u2019s internal guidelines and partly by the fact that non-auditing assignments must be approved in advance by the audit committee. Didrik Roos conducts auditing assignments for Boozt AB, Systembolaget AB, and Tele2 AB.\n\nThe auditors attend all meetings of the audit committee. The board meeting held in January 2022 was attended by Didrik Roos to notify the board of the scope, focus, significant considerations and conclusions of the 2020/2021 audit.\n\nIn addition to this involvement, the auditor meets regularly with the chair of the board, the audit committee\u2019s chair and other members, the executive management and other key individuals. The auditor also takes part in the AGM, reporting the conclusions drawn from the audit.\n\nAlongside its mandate as elected auditor, Deloitte has also carried out related tasks such as limited assurance of the Sustainability Disclosure. In addition, Deloitte has assisted with other consulting services, primarily tax advice. Deloitte has internal processes to ensure its independence before these tasks are begun. The audit committee also has a process for approving non-auditing services in advance, before such assignments are begun. The audit committee evaluates the auditor annually to gain assurance that the auditor\u2019s objectivity and independence cannot be questioned.\n4. BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nThe task of the board of directors is to manage H&M\u2019s affairs in the interests of the company and all its shareholders, and to safeguard and encourage a good corporate culture. This means that the board has the overall responsibility for the company\u2019s administration, taking a long-term, sustainable approach with a focus on the customer offering and growth.\n\nIn addition to laws and recommendations, the work of the board is regulated by the board\u2019s order of procedure which contains rules on the distribution of work between the board, its committees and the CEO as well as on financial reporting, investments and financing. The order of procedure, which also includes the procedure for the audit committee, is updated as needed but is established at least once a year.\n\nComposition of H&M\u2019s board and independence of its members\nThe board members are elected by the shareholders at the general meeting, normally at the AGM and for the period up to and including the next AGM. Since the 2022 AGM the board has consisted of eight ordinary members, with no deputies, as well as three employee representatives and three deputies for these positions. Only the employee representatives and their deputies are employed by the company. Since the 2022 AGM the board has consisted of the following members elected by the general meeting: Karl-Johan Persson (chair), Stina Bergfors, Anders Dahlvig, Danica Kragic Jensfelt, Lena Patriksson Keller, Christian Sievert, Erica Wiking H\u00e4ger and Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m. Tim Gahnstr\u00f6m, Ingrid Godin and Louise Wikholm are the regular employee representatives, with Hampus Glanzelius, Agneta Gustafsson, and Margareta Welinder as their deputies. For more facts about H&M\u2019s board members see pages 69-71.\n\nBoard members are required to devote the time and attention that their position on the board demands. New members receive introductory training that includes meetings with the heads of the various brands and functions.\n\nThe composition of the board during the year met the independence requirements set out in sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the Code. This means that a majority of the board members elected by the general meeting are independent of the company and its management. A majority of the board members are also independent of the company\u2019s major shareholders.\n\nNumber of board meetings\nDuring the financial year H&M normally holds six regular board meetings, one of which is the statutory board meeting. Extraordinary board meetings are held when the need arises. The CEO attends all board meetings, except on the occasion when the CEO\u2019s terms of employment are being discussed. The CEO reports to the board on the operational work within the group and ensures that ahead of each board meeting the board is given relevant and objective information on which to base its decisions.\n\nThe CFO and chief accountant also attend the board meetings in order to provide financial information. The board is assisted by a secretary who is not a member of the board. During the year, 11 board meetings were held. This is more than usual but is explained by the operations having been affected by very challenging geopolitical and macroeconomic circumstances, resulting in significantly more board meetings than in a normal year. As in previous years, attendance levels at the board meetings were very high. For details of meeting attendance by each member see the table on page 63.\n\nWork of the board in 2022\nH&M\u2019s board meetings are generally structured as shown below. This is supplemented by one or more business presentations, e.g., by the heads of functions, brands or regions. The following are usually reviewed at each board meeting:\n\n\u2014 Minutes of the previous meeting\n\u2014 CEO\u2019s status report and report by CFO\n\u2014 Strategic matters\n\u2014 Feedback from latest audit committee meeting\n\u2014 Financial reporting such as interim report, full-year report, and annual and sustainability report\n\u2014 Any other business\n\nAs the geopolitical and macroeconomic situation was very challenging in 2022, the effects of this on the H&M group\u2019s operations formed a key part of the board\u2019s work during the year; among other things, resulting in the decision to wind down the business in Russia and action to manage the high level of inflation. Such challenges combined with the repercussions of the pandemic led to discussion of matters such as the customer offering and its pricing, the supply chain, sustainability, tech and communication. A global programme to reduce costs and improve efficiency within the organisation was introduced. Decisions were\n## COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD AND ATTENDANCE IN THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2022\n\n| NAME                        | YEAR ELECTED | INDEPENDENT 1 | INDEPENDENT 2 | FEES (SEK) | BOARD MEETINGS | AUDITING COMMITTEE | SHAREHOLDINGS | SHARES HELD BY RELATED PARTIES |\n|-----------------------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------|--------------------------------|\n| Karl-Johan Persson, Chair   | 2020         | Yes           | No            | 1,700,000  | 11/11          |                     | 12,136,289    | Shareholder in Ramsbury Invest AB 6 |\n| Stina Bergfors              | 2016         | Yes           | Yes           | 650,000    | 11/11          |                     | 1,000         | 8,000 and 6,000 7 |\n| Anders Dahlvig              | 2010         | Yes           | Yes           | 825,000    | 11/11          | 4/4                 | 17,510        |                                |\n| Danica Kragic Jensfelt      | 2019         | Yes           | Yes           | 650,000    | 11/11          |                     | 2,500         | 700                            |\n| Lena Patriksson Keller      | 2014         | Yes           | Yes           | 650,000    | 11/11          |                     | 1,200 and 19,000 and 2,400 8 |\n| Christian Sievert           | 2010         | Yes           | No 9          | 875,000    | 11/11          | 4/4                 | 81,000        | 750 11 |\n| Erica Wiking H\u00e4ger          | 2016         | Yes           | Yes           | 825,000    | 11/11          | 4/4                 |               |                                |\n| Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m            | 2014         | Yes           | Yes           | 650,000    | 11/11          |                     | 72,700        |                                |\n| Ingrid Godin, employee rep. | 2012         |               |               |            | 11/11          |                     | 60            |                                |\n| Louise Wikholm, employee rep.| 2021        |               |               |            | 8/11           |                     |               |                                |\n| Tim Gahnstr\u00f6m, employee rep.| 2021        |               |               |            | 4/11 12       |                     |               |                                |\n| Agneta Gustafsson, deputy employee rep. | 2022 |               |               |            | 9/11           |                     |               |                                |\n| Hampus Glanzelius, deputy employee rep. | 2021 |               |               |            | 7/11           |                     |               |                                |\n| Margareta Welinder, deputy employee rep. | 2007 |               |               |            | 4/11           |                     |               |                                |\n\n1) Independent of the company and company management in accordance with the Swedish Corporate Governance Code.\n2) Independent of major shareholders in the company in accordance with the Swedish Corporate Governance Code.\n3) Fees as resolved at the 2021 annual general meeting. This means that the fees related to the period until the next AGM, i.e. for the period 6 May 2021 to 4 May 2022. The amounts were paid out after the 2022 AGM.\n4) Attendance via technology is equated with attendance in person.\n5) There is no outstanding share- or share price-related incentive programme for the board of directors.\n6) Ramsbury Invest AB owns 194,400,000 class A shares and 653,093,901 class B shares as of 30 November 2022.\n7) 8,000 shares held through Stina Bergfors\u2019s company SCEBE Holding AB and 6,000 shares held by spouse.\n8) 1,200 shares owned through Lena Patriksson Keller\u2019s private company Verdani Holding AB. 9,450 shares held by spouse and children.\n9) Christian Sievert is not considered independent of Ramsbury Invest AB since Ramsbury Invest AB is a major shareholder in a company of which Christian Sievert is CEO.\n10) Shares held by related parties: 19,000 shares held through Christian Sievert\u2019s company Whitechris Industri AB and 2,400 shares held by spouse and children. Supplementary disclosure: in addition to Christian Sievert\u2019s shareholding shown above, Christian Sievert holds 9,000 H&M shares via a pension plan.\n11) 750 shares owned through Erica Wiking H\u00e4ger\u2019s company Erica Wiking H\u00e4ger Advokat\u00e4mbet.\n12) Tim Gahnstr\u00f6m temporarily left the board during a couple of months. He was re-elected as employee representative by the union and member of the board again during late autumn.\n\nAlso made concerning changes to the organisation to fit future business models.\n\nOther examples of subjects discussed during the year were cybersecurity, the store portfolio, future ways of working etc.\n\nExamples of the brands/functions of the business that presented their work to the board during the year are: the H&M brand, Sellpy, supply chain, business tech and others. At each board meeting the chair of the audit committee reports to the board on what the audit committee discussed at its latest meeting. This primarily concerns areas such as accounting, IFRS 16 effects, audit, tax, customs duties, internal control, risk and various new regulations, legislation and directives. All significant risks are then discussed at a subsequent board meeting. At four of the year\u2019s meetings the board goes through interim financial reports before they are published and at the January meeting the board discusses the annual and sustainability report, with the auditor also reporting on the year\u2019s audit. The board also meets with the company\u2019s auditors without the CEO or other representatives of executive management being present.\nAs every year, in 2022 the board took various decisions. These included deciding on a SEK 3 billion share buyback programme based on authorisation from the annual general meeting, a proposed dividend of SEK 6.50 per share, an updated finance policy, the proposed remuneration report and decisions concerning the financial statements, as well as deciding on a cost and efficiency programme, an investment plan, a growth plan and targets.\n\nAt the board meeting held in January 2022 the board of directors resolved that the company is to double its sales while at the same time halving its carbon footprint by 2030. Profitability is to exceed 10 percent over time. The H&M group\u2019s goal to increase sales by 10-15 percent per year with continued high profitability remains a long-term target.\n\nSince H&M does not have a separate review function (internal audit function) for work on internal control, but has instead established its own model for managing the company\u2019s risk and internal control (see pages 66-68), once a year the board assesses the need for a separate internal audit function. In 2022 the board again reached the conclusion that the present model for monitoring internal control is satisfactory.\n\nAhead of the AGM the board presented a remuneration report for 2021 in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act and the Remuneration Rules issued by the Swedish Stock Market Self Regulation Committee. The remuneration report describes how the guidelines for remuneration within H&M adopted at the 2020 AGM were applied in the 2021 financial year. The remuneration report for 2021 is available at hmgroup.com/annual-general-meeting-2022.\n\nH&M has no remuneration committee since the board of directors deems it more appropriate for the entire board to carry out the tasks of a remuneration committee, as is entirely in accordance with requirement 9.2 of the Code. It is the board that prepares the proposed guidelines for remuneration to senior executives that are presented at the AGMs, and it is the board that decides on the CEO\u2019s salary in accordance with the latest guidelines adopted at the AGM. The board continually assesses the CEO\u2019s work and once a year discusses this matter separately in conjunction with the setting of the CEO\u2019s remuneration for the coming year. No member of executive management is present when this is discussed.\n\nThe board continually evaluates its work, and the chair of the board is in regular contact with the board members between meetings as part of the board\u2019s work and its evaluation process. Among other things this evaluation covers working methods, the working climate, wishes and the main focus of the board\u2019s work. It also focuses on access to and the need for specialist expertise within the board. The evaluation is used as a tool for how the board is to operate and additionally forms a basis for the work of the nomination committee.\n\n5. AUDIT COMMITTEE\nThe audit committee monitors the company\u2019s financial reporting, including monitoring the effectiveness of the company\u2019s internal control and risk management. The committee\u2019s work includes handling auditing topics and financial reports published by the company. The auditors attend the meetings of the audit committee to report on their scrutiny of H&M\u2019s annual report and financial statements, including the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe audit committee reviews and monitors the impartiality and independence of the auditor and regulates which assignments the accounting firm may conduct for H&M in addition to the audit. The audit committee annually receives a written assurance of independence from the auditor stating which services the accounting firm has provided to H&M during the financial year in addition to the audit. The audit committee also assists the nomination committee with any proposals to the AGM concerning the election of auditors.\n\nThe audit committee consists of three board members \u2014 two with expertise in accounting or auditing and the third with expertise in commercial law. All the members are independent of the company and its management. A majority of the members are also independent of the company\u2019s major shareholders. The audit committee is appointed annually by the board of directors at the statutory board meeting held in conjunction with the AGM. Since the statutory meeting held in conjunction with the 2022 AGM, the audit committee has consisted of chair Christian Sievert and members Anders Dahlvig and Erica Wiking H\u00e4ger. The committee held four meetings at which minutes were taken during the 2022 financial year.\n\n1) The baseline for the sales goal is 2021. The H&M group\u2019s goal is to reduce its carbon footprint in absolute figures by 56 percent by 2030 baseline 2019 in accordance with the H&M group\u2019s commitment at COP26. Profitability refers to operating profit in relation to sales. The ambition is to achieve the profitability target no later than 2024.\nDeloitte attended the minuted audit committee meetings to provide debriefs on the auditing work. The meetings were also attended by, among others, the CFO, the chief accountant, and the head of corporate governance. Minutes from the committee\u2019s meetings were distributed to all board members.\n\nDuring the year the audit committee addressed the following matters, among others:\n\n\u2014 The company\u2019s financial reporting, including interim reports, the corporate governance report and annual report.\n\u2014 Compliance with the group\u2019s internal control and risk management processes and review of the overall risk analysis for the group.\n\u2014 Information provided by the following functions and departments on their work: People & Organisational Development, Security, Growth, Accounting/ Tax, Supply Chain and Business Tech.\n\u2014 The transfer pricing model, tax matters and matters relating to customs.\n\u2014 Follow-up on previous discussions on privacy, including GDPR.\n\u2014 Follow-up on H&M Group policies.\n\u2014 Information provided by Deloitte on the audit plan, the scope of the audit and the results of scrutiny carried out.\n\u2014 Review of the auditors\u2019 independence and impartiality. The audit committee agreed it was clear which assignments Deloitte had taken on in addition to auditing and found no reason to question the accounting firm\u2019s impartiality.\n\nThe audit committee has established a process to approve in advance any non-auditing services carried out by the auditors. H&M also uses consulting services from other accounting firms and tax advisors.\n\n6. EMPLOYEE ORGANISATIONS\nUnder Swedish law, employees in large companies have the right to appoint employee representatives with deputies to the company\u2019s board. These are appointed via employee organisations (trade unions). The trade unions appoint three board members and three deputies to the H&M board.\n\n7. CEO\nThe CEO is appointed by the board of directors and is responsible for the daily management of the company as directed by the board. This means that, among other things, the CEO must focus on recruitment of senior executives, buying and logistics matters, the customer offering, pricing strategy, sales and profitability, sustainability matters, marketing, expansion, digital development, and development and further integration of the store and online channels. The CEO reports to the board on H&M\u2019s development and makes the necessary preparations for taking decisions on matters such as investments and expansion. The role of CEO includes contact with the financial market, the media, and the authorities.\n\nHelena Helmersson, born in 1973, has been CEO since 30 January 2020. In 1997, Helena Helmersson joined H&M as a controller in the buying department, after which she worked in various roles in buying and production. Helena Helmersson was head of sustainability for five years and subsequently head of production based in Hong Kong. For just over a year prior to becoming CEO, she worked as COO (chief operating officer) with responsibility for expansion, logistics, production, IT and advanced data analytics/artificial intelligence, as well as insights and analytics.\n\nBy the end of the financial year 2022, Helena Helmersson held 19,070 shares in H&M. She also held 300,000 call options issued by Ramsbury Invest AB, with each option providing the right to buy one class B share in H&M during the 12 months following a three-year period from the agreement date of 7 October 2020.\n\n8, 9. ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT\nH&M has a multi-brand matrix organisation with the following brands: the H&M brand which includes the H&M HOME brand, and the Portfolio Brands consisting of COS, Weekday, Monki, & Other Stories and ARKET. The group also consists of Business Ventures, which includes among others Afound, Creator Studio, Singular Society, and majority owned Sellpy. Each brand has its own organisation and managing director, and most of the brands have their own local or regional sales organisations. Centrally, there are also several of group functions that support each brand to capitalise on the benefits across shared areas, so that each brand and country works according to central policies and guidelines. The CEO is responsible for day-to-day management of H&M and appoints the members of the executive management team. As of 30 November 2022, the executive management comprised 15 individuals, five of whom are women. The cost and efficiency programme that was initiated during autumn 2022 also involves reviewing the organisation. This is reflected in the executive management team after the closing of the financial year. For updated information,\nsee https://hmgroup.com/about-us/corporate-governance/company-management/.\n\nIn addition to the CEO, the executive management team consists of the CFO, the person with responsibility for the H&M brand, the person with responsibility for Portfolio Brands, the person with responsibility for Business Ventures, the person with responsibility for Business Tech and the CTO reporting to that role, and the heads of the following group functions: Strategy & Transformation, Growth, People & Organisational Development, Sustainability, Supply Chain, Communications, The Laboratory, and the Group Strategy Counsel. Those responsible for other group functions are appointed by the CFO.\n\nThe matrix organisation provides a combination of central and local perspectives on leadership and entrepreneurship.\n\nThe regional and local sales organisations are responsible for daily retail operations in their region and country and take collective responsibility for all the regional and local support functions, whose work is based on instructions from the central group functions.\n\n**Internal control**\n\nThe board of directors is responsible for the company\u2019s internal control, the overall aim of which is to safeguard the company\u2019s assets and thereby its shareholders\u2019 investment. Internal control and risk management are part of the board\u2019s and the management\u2019s control and follow-up responsibilities, with the purpose of managing the business in the most appropriate and effective manner possible \u2014 to ensure reliable financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. This description of H&M\u2019s internal control and risk management for financial reporting has been prepared in accordance with chapter 6 section 6 of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and section 7.4 of the Code.\n\nH&M uses the internationally recognised COSO framework as a basis to maintain and develop its internal control. The COSO framework is made up of five components: control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring.\n\n**CONTROL ENVIRONMENT**\n\nThe control environment forms the basis of internal control and includes the culture that the board and management create and communicate, and by which they work. The control environment consists primarily of ethical values and integrity, expertise, management philosophy, organisational structure, responsibility and authority, policies and related guidelines and instructions, as well as routines.\n\nIt is particularly important that management documents such as internal policies, guidelines and manuals exist in significant areas and that these provide the employees with solid guidance. The Code of Ethics, signed by all employees doing business with business partners, is an ethical policy that permeates the entire company. It describes the way in which employees should act within the company and in business relations with suppliers. The document \u201cOur way\u201d summarise how values, policies and guidelines come together with the intention to ensure business is carried out in an ethical, responsible, sustainable, and transparent way. \u201cOur way\u201d is intended for all colleagues within all brands and functions of H&M, as well as external stakeholders. Read more about \u201cOur way\u201d at hmgroup.com/about-us/our-way/.\n\nH&M\u2019s internal control structure is based on:\n\n- The division of accountability between the board of directors, the audit committee, and the CEO, which is clearly described in the board\u2019s formal rules of procedure\n- Regular reporting from the executive management team and the audit committee to the board, according to established routines\n- The company\u2019s organisational structure\n- Values, guidelines, policies, and manuals\n- Control activities, checks and balances, analysis, and reporting\n\nH&M has a matrix organisation, which means that those responsible for the joint group functions are also responsible for the efficiency and effectiveness of work within their function at each brand. Each brand has its own organisation and managing director, and all the brands have their own local or regional sales organisations.\n\nInternal control is evaluated annually by the relevant group function, which checks that its function in each country is working according to the prescribed policies and guidelines. Stores are checked by internal store auditors.\n\nAll subsidiaries within H&M have the same structure and accounting system with the same chart of\naccounts. This simplifies the creation of appropriate routines and control systems, which in turn facilitates internal control and comparisons between the various companies. There are detailed instructions for the store staff that control daily work in the stores. Many other guidelines and manuals are also available within the group. In most cases these are drawn up in the central departments at the head office in Stockholm and then communicated to the respective departments in regional and country offices. Each central department regularly reviews its guidelines and manuals to see which need updating and whether new guidelines need to be developed.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT\nOperational and financial risks are continuously analysed by all brands and group functions. This process of risk review and assessment identifies the systems, methods and controls that are in place to minimise any impact of the risks. For the most significant issues, the suggested risk acceptance or mitigation is evaluated quarterly in collaboration with the corporate governance function.\n\nAn updated climate risk analysis according to the guidelines issued by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was carried out during 2021, see page 103. The company\u2019s first TCFD analysis was conducted in 2019.\n\nAt the end of 2022 the group\u2019s main risks were summarised to the audit committee and were subsequently discussed by the board.\n\nFor a description of H&M\u2019s operational risks, see the administration report on pages 76-78. For a description of risks within financial reporting, see the administration report on pages 78-79 and note 2, Financial risks, on pages 120-121 of the Annual and Sustainability Report for 2022.\n\nCONTROL ACTIVITIES\nThere are a number of control activities built into processes to support business efficiency and accurate financial reporting. These control activities, which aim to prevent, find and correct inaccuracies and non-compliance, can exist at all levels and in all parts of the organisation. Within H&M, control activities include effective control and analysis of sales statistics, account reconciliation, monthly accounts and financial reports.\n\nInternal control measures in the Business Tech function also include internal control on systems relating to financial reporting. These financial systems are reviewed by an external party in cooperation with H&M.\n\nINFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION\nPolicies and guidelines are of particular importance for accurate accounting, reporting and provision of information, and define the control activities to be carried out.\n\nH&M has a communications policy providing guidelines for communication with external parties. The purpose of the policy is to ensure that all disclosure obligations are met and that the information provided is accurate and complete.\n\nFinancial communication is provided via:\n\n\u2014 The Annual and Sustainability Report\n\u2014 Interim reports, the full-year report and quarterly sales reports\n\u2014 Press releases on events and circumstances that may impact the share price\n\u2014 H&M\u2019s website hmgroup.com\n\nMONITORING\nIn 2022, the company\u2019s central functions assessed internal control within their respective functions in sales countries, based partly on general issues and partly on department-specific issues. Due to the ongoing impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on internal control, all functions continued to operate with reduced travel to countries to carry out internal control and instead undertook control activities remotely to the degree required.\n\nThis internal control assessment work resulted in a plan of action for each central function, defining areas for improvement to further strengthen internal control \u2014 not only in respect of each country, but also for the central function itself. The central functions also followed up on assessments made in the previous year. The way in which H&M executes internal control is considered to be firmly established within the organisation, providing an aid and an instrument that the central functions can use to ensure their respective departments in sales countries and regions are working in line with company guidelines. The assessment of internal control also allows each sales country and region to provide valuable and constructive feedback to the central function.\nregarding potential areas for improvement. Another important part of the internal control work is the feedback to regional and country management provided by the central function.\n\nWithin the production organisation, additional control and monitoring activities are brought together in the internal Routine Handbook for Production, which helps to ensure the company does business in an ethical and transparent way. Most of the activities described in the Handbook are monitored monthly at a regional level and every other month at a global level.\n\nInternal store auditors perform annual checks at a subset of the stores to identify strengths, weaknesses and corrective actions.\n\nThe board of directors and audit committee continually evaluate the information provided by the executive management team, including information on internal control. The audit committee\u2019s task of monitoring the efficiency of internal control carried out by the management team is of particular interest to the board. This work includes checking that steps are taken in response to any shortcomings detected and suggestions made during assessments by the central departments and internal store auditors, as well as by external auditors. This monitoring work maintains awareness of the importance of effective internal control and supports continuous improvement within the group.\n\nINTERNAL AUDIT\nIn accordance with section 7.4 of the Code, during the year the board assessed the need for a specific internal audit process. The board concluded that H&M\u2019s present model of monitoring internal control is the most appropriate for the company. In the board\u2019s opinion this model \u2014 which the central departments such as Finance & Accounting, Growth, Supply Chain (including Logistics and Production), Business Tech, Communications, and Security apply in the subsidiaries \u2014 as well as the work carried out in stores by local security department representatives, are in line with the work performed in other companies by an internal audit department. The board therefore deemed that there was no need for an internal audit department.\n\nThe issue of a specific internal audit department will be reviewed again in 2023.\n\nStockholm, March 2023\n\nThe Board of Directors\n\nMore information on H&M\u2019s corporate governance work can be found at hmgroup.com/corporate governance.

Any references made to \u201cH&M\u201d, \u201cH&M Group\u201d, \u201cthe H&M group\u201d and \u201cthe company\u201d in this administration report refers hereinafter to H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ).\n\nBUSINESS\nThe H&M group is a customer-focused, creative, value-driven, responsible fashion and design company. All the group\u2019s brands share a passion to make great fashion and design available to everyone in a more sustainable way. The business consists mainly of sales of clothing, accessories, footwear, cosmetics, home textiles and homeware to consumers. Sales take place through digital and physical channels, which are increasingly being integrated to provide customers with a smooth and inspiring experience regardless of where, when and how they choose to meet us \u2014 in stores, on the brands\u2019 websites, in digital marketplaces or via social media. In some markets, the brands\u2019 products are sold via franchise partners.\n\nThe group consists of the brands H&M, H&M HOME, H&M Move, COS, Weekday, Monki, & Other Stories and ARKET. In addition, the company has a number of business ventures, with the mission to test and scale businesses based on new business models and partnerships, to engage with customers in new ways and to create added customer value. The ventures drive new revenue streams and are an important part of delivering future growth for the H&M group. Examples of the company\u2019s business ventures are Afound, Singular Society, Creator Studio and majority-owned Sellpy.\n\nEach of the group\u2019s brands has its own unique identity. Together they complement each other and offer a variety of trends and styles at various price points within fashion, beauty, accessories and homeware.\n\nThe H&M group\u2019s aim is to make fashion and design accessible to everyone in a way that is good for the business, while reducing negative impacts on people and the planet. The brands are working to shift to more circular business models for their products and services, and are increasing the percentage of recycled and other more sustainably sourced materials in their collections.\n\nEach brand has its own design and buying function consisting of people with diverse backgrounds, experiences and skills, which is key to producing relevant and inspiring collections for their particular customer group. H&M\u2019s design and buying function creates its collections centrally in Stockholm, while COS \u2014 for example \u2014 has its design and buying function in London. Afound departs from this model. It is a marketplace for products from brands\u2019 previous and current seasons \u2014 both external brands and the H&M group\u2019s own \u2014 which are discounted to provide a new opportunity to attract customers. Creator Studio in turn is a B2B service offering on-demand print services, enabling external brands and content creators to utilise the H&M group\u2019s supply chain to produce their own merchandise for sale. Majority-owned Sellpy is an e-commerce platform for second-hand sales with a business model that makes it easy for customers to buy and sell used items. Through its investment arm H&M CO:LAB, the group invests in start-ups to drive entrepreneurship related to, for example, circularity in the fashion and retail industries to support the group\u2019s sustainability goals. For more information see pages 14-29.\n\nComment on results\nThe company\u2019s decision to wind down the business in Russia, which was an important and profitable market, has had a significant negative impact on the results.\nduring the year. The hikes in raw materials and freight costs combined with a historically strong US dollar resulted in extensive cost increases for purchases of goods. Rather than passing on the full cost to the customers, the company chose to strengthen its market position further. On top of this there were increased energy costs as well as a one-time charge for the cost and efficiency programme that was initiated at the end of the year.\n\nInformation concerning exposure to Russia, Belarus and Ukraine\nOn 24 February 2022 the H&M group paused sales in Ukraine as a consequence of Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\nOn 2 March 2022 all sales in Russia and Belarus were also paused. On 18 July 2022 the H&M group announced that it had decided to begin winding down the business in Russia in a responsible manner.\n\nA one-time cost of around SEK 1.8 billion has been charged to earnings for the financial year in respect of the wind-down. The one-time cost is expected to have a negative cash flow effect of around SEK 1 billion in total, mainly in 2023. By 30 November 2022 all of the H&M group\u2019s 172 stores in Russia had been permanently closed. The total financial effect on the H&M group\u2019s full-year results compared with the previous year was SEK 3.7 billion before tax.\n\nThe business in Belarus, where there were three stores, has also been wound down.\n\nThe company is monitoring developments in Ukraine closely. The safety of colleagues and customers always has highest priority. The hope is to be able to reopen the H&M group\u2019s operations in the country as soon as this is possible.\n\nDirection\nIn 2022, the H&M group continued to work according to its business plan, which aims to deliver long-term profitable growth in a more sustainable way. The business plan is based on the company\u2019s ongoing transformation work and is illustrated by a number of objectives to which the company\u2019s sustainability work and digital transformation contribute. These objectives are to continue improving the customer offering for all the brands, to build long-term and value-creating customer relationships, to offer an inspiring experience with integrated digital and physical channels, to adapt the supply chain so that it is efficient and based on demand, and to add more revenue streams based on new emerging business models and innovations. In line with the H&M group\u2019s goal of a strong capital structure with good liquidity and financial flexibility, the objectives are designed to support sound finances while enabling continued freedom of action for growth and investments. Moving successfully towards these objectives is expected to result in long-term, profitable growth while at the same time reducing the company\u2019s climate impact. By 2030 at the latest, the H&M group aims to double sales while at the same time halving its greenhouse gas emissions. Profitability is to exceed 10 percent over time.1\n\nFIVE YEAR SUMMARY\n\n| FINANCIAL YEAR | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 20192 | 20182 |\n|---------------|------|------|------|-------|-------|\n| Net sales, SEK m | 223,553 | 198,967 | 187,031 | 232,755 | 210,400 |\n| Operating profit, SEK m | 7,169 | 15,255 | 3,099 | 17,346 | 15,493 |\n| Operating margin, % | 3.2 | 7.7 | 1.7 | 7.5 | 7.4 |\n| Profit after financial items, SEK m | 6,216 | 14,300 | 2,052 | 17,391 | 15,639 |\n| Operating cash flow per share, SEK | 14.84 | 26.96 | 15.65 | 17.51 | 12.86 |\n| Return on equity, % | 6.4 | 19.2 | 2.2 | 23.3 | 21.4 |\n| Equity/assets ratio, % | 27.9 | 33.4 | 31.3 | 47.4 | 49.3 |\n| Average number of employees | 106,522 | 107,375 | 110,325 | 126,376 | 123,283 |\n\nFor definitions of key performance measures see page 147.\n\n1) The baseline for the sales goal is 2021.

COS will launch in Mexico and Arket is scheduled to open in Estonia in 2023. & Other Stories will open on The Iconic in Australia in 2023.\n\nThe H&M group is continuing to renegotiate a large number of leases as part of the company\u2019s store optimisation, which also involves rebuilds and adjustment of the number of stores and of store space to ensure the best store portfolio in each market. The H&M group\u2019s contracts allow around a third of leases to be renegotiated or exited each year. For 2023 the plan is to open around 100 new stores and close around 200 stores, making a net decrease of around 100 stores. Most of the openings will be in growth markets, while the closures will mainly be in established markets.\n\nEmployees\n\nThe H&M group\u2019s business is characterised by a fundamental respect for the individual. The company is committed to treating all employees equally, with respect and dignity, and to empowering them to be who they want to be. Everyone working for the H&M group should expect fair compensation and benefits in healthy, safe and inclusive workplaces free from discrimination, with the right to freedom of association.\n\nThe H&M group\u2019s values have guided employees since the day that the company was founded, and continue to support the business today. The group\u2019s culture, values, and empowering leadership are actively and consciously integrated throughout the entire organisation. This supports the mindsets and behaviours needed to stay ahead and remain relevant, and helps attract and develop people who have the right competences and ambition to grow with the company.\n\nA constantly changing world and new customer behaviour continue to increase the complexity of the retail business. To stay competitive and meet increased customer demands, the company continues with its transformation work, which encompasses all parts of the company and includes, among other things, enhanced digitalisation, a competence shift within the tech organisation, simplifying the organisational structure, new ways of working, and further integration across brands and functions.\n\nAt the end of the financial year, the H&M group had approximately 150,000 employees. The average number of employees in the group, converted into full-time positions, was 106,522 (107,375), of which 10,447 (10,540) were employed in Sweden. Of this average number of employees, around 75 percent were women. Of those in positions of responsibility within the company, such as store managers and country managers, 75 percent were women.\n\nEVENTS AFTER THE CLOSING DATE\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2023 the H&M Group has acquired the controlling interest in Sellpy, which thereby will be consolidated starting in the first\nquarter. For more details, see the three-month report for 2023.\n\nRISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nThe H&M group has an entrepreneurial approach to business development. Launching new initiatives and business ventures makes it necessary to accept business risks to a degree.\n\nOperational risks include the business risks together with events in the outside world which affect a certain sector, market or a brand in the group. Financial risks are related to the use of economic funds and financial resources.\n\nOperational and financial risks are continually analysed, and risk acceptance or mitigation is evaluated quarterly by all brands and group functions for the most significant group risks, together with the corporate governance function.\n\nEvaluation of the business impact determines whether an action is to be taken to reduce the likelihood of a risk, and if so, to what extent. Business decisions also determine the extent to which the consequences of a risk should be mitigated.\n\nThere are external risks and uncertainties affecting the H&M group that are related to the shift in the industry, fashion, competitors, logistics resources, information security and cybersecurity, sustainability issues, weather, macroeconomics and geopolitical events, pandemics, foreign currencies, taxes, and various regulations and ordinances.\n\nA description of the H&M group\u2019s operational and financial risks is given in the sections below, with more detailed information concerning financial risks being given in note 2, Financial risks.\n\nThe H&M group\u2019s overall approach to risk management and internal control is described on pages 66\u201367 in the corporate governance report. The description includes how the H&M group works according to the COSO and TCFD frameworks.\n\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nDuring 2022 there was a further increase over 2021 in the ratio of risks related to external events \u2014 such as the war in Ukraine, transport costs, inflation, and energy costs in Europe \u2014 compared to business risks. Increasing numbers of purchases are being made online, which have become an increasingly important part of the customer experience. Customers are looking for a smooth, simple and inspiring experience in which stores and online interact and enhance each other. In recent years the H&M group has therefore made substantial investments to provide this. As the competitive landscape is redrawn by new business models and players, profitability in the industry has been impacted by increased competition.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has made the group\u2019s brands and functions work hard to manage challenges related to cost levels, supply chain and the customer experience, while still delivering without compromising on the business idea of the group\u2019s brands: fashion and quality at the best price in a more sustainable way. For the H&M group the importance of having good risk mitigation plans alongside issue and crisis management capacity has been accentuated by the pandemic.\n\nReputational risk\nAs one of the world\u2019s leading fashion companies, the H&M group\u2019s brands attract great interest and are constantly in the spotlight. To safeguard and manage its brands, it is important that the H&M group continues to be developed and run according to its values, which are characterised by strong business ethics.\n\nIt is of utmost importance that the H&M group lives up to the high ambitions set out in its policies and guidelines on business ethics, and that anyone involved in the business has good knowledge and insight into the procedures for the production of its products. It is also crucial that the H&M group can reach its sustainability goals and ambitions. Accurate, transparent and reliable communications can prevent occurrences of reputational risk and can also help mitigate the consequences of any incidents.\n\nFashion risk\nOperating in the fashion industry is a risk in itself. Fashion has a limited shelf-life and there is always a risk that some part of the collections will not be sufficiently commercial, and will therefore not be well received by customers. Purchasing decisions are also increasingly influenced by customers\u2019 desire to live more sustainably.\n\nWithin each segment and each collection it is crucial to have the right volumes and a correct balance in the mix between fashion basics and the latest trends. In summary, each collection must achieve the best\ncombination of fashion, quality, price and sustainability. An increasing degree of accuracy in purchasing decisions and volumes will help reduce overall resource consumption and contribute to our climate and circularity goals.\n\nTo increase precision, the H&M group works intensively to optimise the extent of ongoing buying during the season in parallel with detailed analysis of day-to-day sales and stock levels in different markets. Today fashion is global, but shopping patterns vary between different markets and sales channels. The start of a season and the nature of a season vary from country to country. Delivery dates and product volumes for the various markets and channels are therefore adjusted accordingly. The capability in the organisation to create regional and local customer offerings has been further developed to meet this demand.\n\nWeather risk\nThe H&M group\u2019s products are purchased for sale based on assumptions concerning weather patterns. Deviation from these assumptions affects sales. This is particularly true at the point of transition between two seasons, such as from summer to autumn or autumn to winter. For example, a warmer than usual autumn may have a negative effect on sales of weather-related garments in particular, such as outerwear and chunky knitwear. The company\u2019s risk analysis has shown that climate change may have further effects on the conditions for producing and distributing products in certain regions and countries. The increasing effects of climate change mean that these variations will likely increase in the future.\n\nNegative macroeconomic changes and geopolitical risks\nOne or more markets may be affected by events that have a negative effect on the macroeconomic situation or geopolitical environment in a country. These changed macroeconomic or geopolitical circumstances, such as political instability, and in the worst case war and also sudden negative events \u2014 for example, virus outbreaks in one or more countries \u2014 may result in rapid changes in the business environment, such as rising inflation, significant disruption in the supply chain and economic downturn, which is likely to change consumer purchasing behaviour and thus negatively impact the group\u2019s sales. Future markets where an H&M Group brand becomes established may have an increased risk of political instability, corruption, or armed conflict.\n\nUncertainties exist concerning how fluctuations in external factors such as the price of raw materials, transport costs and suppliers\u2019 capacity will affect buying costs for the group\u2019s products. There are also risks associated with social tensions in sourcing markets, which may lead to instability for suppliers, and in manufacturing and deliveries.\n\nThe group therefore needs to monitor such changes closely and have strategies in place to deal with fluctuations as advantageously as possible for both the company and external stakeholders.\n\nSustainability risks\nThe H&M group\u2019s sustainability strategies aim to lead the change towards a more sustainable fashion industry. Climate change and its impacts has been identified as one of the company\u2019s most significant risks. Other principal risks identified include shortage of natural resources, failure to uphold human rights early in the value chain, corruption, political and social instability in production and sourcing markets, and changed consumption patterns and customer attitudes. This last factor could ultimately have major effects on the H&M group\u2019s sales \u2014 both positive and negative. The outcome depends on how successful the company is in its work to develop relevant and more sustainable customer offerings and business models. For a more detailed description of risks related to sustainability see pages 86-107. For the climate risk analysis according to TCFD, see pages 103-107.\n\nCompetitors\nThe H&M group is constantly evolving its customer offering and experience, to improve its capability and capacity to have a more relevant and attractive customer offering than its competitors.\n\nInformation security and cybersecurity\nAll companies are exposed to various types of risks related to information technology. The risks to which the H&M group is exposed in this area are generically applicable to any large company, and especially to large companies that also trade online. These risks include hacking attempts on networks, disruption of system stability, and attempts to access customer accounts or login details from employees by means of phishing. The H&M group manages this type of risk continuously. Ongoing investments, adjustments and improvements are made to the organisation, systems, procedures and subcontractors in order to deal with security risks in the best way possible.\nData protection and GDPR\nThe H&M group works actively with privacy risks to protect customers\u2019 and employees\u2019 data, and to safeguard customer experience and employee confidence.\n\nAs legislation in some jurisdictions could lead to significant administrative fees, a central team provides support and guidance on privacy risks, data protection issues and new privacy legislations across countries relevant to H&M Group. Additionally, a central tech team provides support and guidance on how to use artificial intelligence in an ethical way.\n\nEach regional organisation has a data privacy manager tasked with ensuring that the framework established by the central organisation is implemented. Compliance with the framework is governed by the central team and reported quarterly to an oversight steering committee.\n\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nForeign currencies\nNearly half of the group\u2019s sales are made in euros, while the most significant currencies for the group\u2019s purchasing are the US dollar and the euro. Fluctuation in the US dollar\u2019s exchange rate against the euro is the single largest foreign currency transaction exposure for the group.\n\nLarge and rapid exchange rate fluctuations, particularly as regards the US dollar as the most important sourcing currency, may also have a significant effect on purchasing costs \u2014 even if this may be regarded as relatively competition-neutral over time. To hedge flows of goods in foreign currencies and thereby reduce the effects of future exchange rate fluctuations, payments for the group\u2019s flows of goods \u2014 i.e. the group\u2019s purchases of goods and, in the majority of cases, also the corresponding foreign currency inflows from the sales companies \u2014 are hedged under forward contracts on an ongoing basis to the companies H & M Finance AB and H & M Hennes & Mauritz GBC AB.\n\nIn addition to the effects of transaction exposure, translation effects also impact the group\u2019s results. These effects arise due to changes in exchange rates between the local currencies of the various foreign sales companies and the Swedish krona compared to the same period the previous year. The underlying profit/loss in a market may be unchanged in the local currency but may increase when converted into SEK if the Swedish krona has weakened or decrease if the Swedish krona has strengthened.\n\nTranslation effects also arise in respect of the group\u2019s net assets on consolidation of the foreign sales companies\u2019 balance sheets. For more information on currency hedging see note 2, Financial risks.\n\nTrade intervention\nPurchasing costs may be affected by decisions at a national level on issues such as export/import subsidies, customs duties (see more below), textile quotas and embargoes. The effects primarily impact customers and companies in individual markets. Global companies with operations in many countries are affected to a lesser extent, and among global corporations\u2019 trade interventions may be regarded as largely competition neutral. In the event of a major trade war between two countries, not just sourcing costs but generally also the entire flow of goods from production to the customer would be affected, which companies would need to mitigate.\n\nCustoms issues: Related party customs valuation continues to attract attention at a global, regional (the European Union) and national level, both from authorities and importers such as the H&M group. It will therefore continue to be important for the H&M group to proactively monitor and manage future developments in this area. One challenge is that customs authorities around the world are not taking a consistent approach to the assessment of pricing between related parties, even though the basis for customs duties is established according to the same global World Trade Organisation (WTO) customs valuation rules.\n\nTaxes\nFor multinational companies, today\u2019s global environment involves complex tax risks, such as the risk of double taxation and tax disputes. As a large global company, the H&M group closely monitors developments in the field of tax. The H&M group is present in many countries and through its operations contributes to the community via various taxes and levies such as corporate tax, customs duties, income taxes, and indirectly via VAT or sales tax on goods sold to customers.\n\nThe H&M group complies with national and international tax legislation, and always pays taxes and levies in line with local laws and regulations in the countries where the H&M group operates. The\nH&M group complies with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) principles and does not shift its income or profits between jurisdictions in a manufactured way, or abuse low-tax or secrecy jurisdictions (tax havens) to gain any tax or financial secrecy benefits. The H&M group\u2019s tax rate for the financial year 2021/2022 was 42.6 (23.0) percent.\n\nThe H&M group\u2019s tax policy, which can be found at hmgroup.com/about-us/corporate-governance/policies, reflects and supports H&M\u2019s business. The H&M group follows the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Transfer Pricing Guidelines, which means that profits are allocated and taxed where the value is created. The tax policy aims at a sustainable tax rate for the H&M group as a whole, and therefore also for the individual countries in which the company operates. Details of individual jurisdictions\u2019 tax positions are made available in the country-by-country reporting as communicated with tax authorities around the globe. The H&M group has been successfully compliant with its tax policy for the financial year 2022 and the company\u2019s quality management system for international tax and transfer pricing has received an ISO 9001:2015 certification.\n\nThe OECD guidelines on transfer pricing can be interpreted in various ways, and consequently, tax authorities in different countries may question the outcome of the H&M group\u2019s transfer pricing model even though the model complies with the OECD guidelines. For each subsidiary, the tax residence is the same as its place of domicile, and no subsidiary is tax resident in more than one jurisdiction. The company\u2019s Taiwan operations are a branch of the Netherlands operations for administrative reasons. Tax is paid in Taiwan and corresponding operational results are tax consolidated in the Netherlands. The whereabouts of the main business activity for each subsidiary, by the country-by-country reporting definition of activities, can be found as an enclosure to the Tax policy.\n\nOn 18 December 2020, the OECD published its Guidance on the transfer pricing implications of the Covid-19 pandemic, which represents the consensus view of the 137 members of the Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) regarding the application of the arm\u2019s length principle and OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines to the situations and challenges associated with the Covid-19 pandemic. The H&M group applied the guidance in its transfer pricing model for 2022.\n\nARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION, ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\nAccording to H&M\u2019s articles of association, the board of H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB is to consist of no less than three and no more than twelve members elected by the general meeting, and no more than the same number of deputies. The annual general meeting decides the exact number of board members and which individuals are to be elected to the board. Board members are elected for the period until the end of the next annual general meeting. The general meeting also decides on amendments to the articles of association.\n\nNUMBER OF SHARES, MAIN SHAREHOLDERS ETC\nAt the end of the financial year H&M had 254,495 shareholders. The total number of shares in H&M is 1,655,072,000, of which 194,400,000 are class A shares (ten votes per share) and 1,460,672,000 are class B shares (one vote per share). The quota value for the shares in H&M is SEK 0.125. As at 30 November 2022, H&M held 25,385,163 H&M class B shares in treasury (1.53 percent of all shares in H&M). All of these treasury shares were purchased for a total amount of SEK 3,000 m in share buybacks during the period June-November 2022 as authorised by the 2022 annual general meeting, for the purpose of distributing surplus liquidity and thereby adjusting H&M\u2019s capital structure by reducing its capital. It is intended that the shares repurchased will be cancelled through a resolution at the 2023 annual general meeting.\n\nThere are no restrictions on voting rights or authorisations to the board relating to the issue or acquisition of the company\u2019s own shares.\n\nH&M\u2019s largest shareholder is Stefan Persson and family, who via Ramsbury Invest AB hold all the class A shares, which represent 57.1 percent of the votes, as well as 653,093,901 (604,856,427) class B shares, representing 19.2 (17.8) percent of the votes. In addition, the family privately own 36,400,289 class B shares. This means that as of 30 November 2022, Stefan\nPersson and family privately and via Ramsbury Invest AB represent 77.3 (75.9) percent of the votes and 53.4 (50.5) percent of the total number of shares. Ramsbury Invest AB is thus formally the parent company of H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB. Ramsbury Invest AB is owned by Stefan Persson and family, and primarily by Stefan Persson. Karl-Johan Persson is also a shareholder in Ramsbury Invest AB.\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\nH&M has elected to make the corporate governance report available as a standalone document to the annual report in accordance with chapter 6 \u00a7 8 of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act. The corporate governance report is available at hmgroup.com/investors/reports/ and is also included on pages 55-72 of the Annual and Sustainability Report.\n\nGUIDELINES FOR REMUNERATION OF SENIOR EXECUTIVES\nThe annual general meeting held on 6 May 2021 adopted the following guidelines for remuneration of senior executives.\n\nThe guidelines cover remuneration to the CEO, remuneration to board members (aside from board fees) and remuneration to other senior executives. Senior executives means members of the executive management team apart from the CEO. The executive management team comprises the individuals who report directly to the CEO.\n\nThe long-term variable remuneration, which applies only to the executive management team including the CEO, will be measured over a five-year period in order to reward long-term value creation for H&M.\n\nHow the guidelines contribute to the company\u2019s business strategy, long-term interests and sustainability\nThe H&M group\u2019s business plan aims to deliver long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. The business plan builds on the company\u2019s ongoing transformation work and is illustrated by a number of objectives to which the company\u2019s sustainability efforts and digital transformation contribute. These objectives are to continue improving the customer offering for all the brands, to build long-term and value-creating customer relationships, to offer an inspiring experience with integrated digital and physical channels, to adapt the supply chain so that it is faster and more flexible based on demand, and to add more revenue streams based on new emerging business models and innovations. Moving successfully towards these objectives is expected to result in finances remaining sound and sustainable, in accordance with the H&M group\u2019s target of a strong capital structure with good liquidity and financial flexibility, allowing continued freedom of action for growth and investments.\n\nThe board considers it important that senior executives are paid competitive remuneration at a market level, as regards both fixed and variable compensation, based on responsibilities and performance. To work successfully according to the company\u2019s business plan and safeguard the company\u2019s long-term interests the company needs to be able to recruit, motivate and retain talented, committed employees. Senior executives shall be compensated at what are considered by the company to be competitive market rates, based partly on industry comparisons. Levels of compensation shall be based partly on the significance of the duties performed, i.e. the ability to affect the overall development of the group, and partly on the employee\u2019s competencies, experience and performance. Together these decide the level of remuneration for the individual concerned. Over time, the largest portion of the remuneration shall consist of the fixed basic salary. The forms of compensation shall motivate senior executives to do their utmost to ensure the good financial and sustainable development of the H&M group.\n\nTypes of remuneration etc.\nThe total remuneration may consist of the following components:\n\n- fixed basic cash salary\n- short-term variable remuneration\n- long-term variable remuneration\n- pension benefits\n- other benefits\n\nFixed basic cash salary\nSenior executives shall have a fixed basic cash salary that is at a market level based on each position\u2019s significance for the company as a whole. The fixed basic cash salary shall reflect the individual\u2019s area of responsibility, competencies and experience and requires the individual to work in a committed manner at a high professional level.\nVariable remuneration\nThe variable remuneration may consist of a short-term and a long-term portion.\n\nThere shall be a clear link between the level of performance-based variable remuneration paid and the H&M group\u2019s financial and sustainable development. Senior executives\u2019 variable remuneration shall therefore depend on the fulfilment of targets. The targets shall aim to promote the H&M group\u2019s development in both the short and the long term.\n\nShort-term variable remuneration: Fulfilment of targets shall be measured over a period of one year. The short-term variable remuneration shall be based on fulfilment of targets in the following areas:\n\n\u2014 the H&M group\u2019s total sales\n\u2014 the H&M group\u2019s total operating profit\n\u2014 fulfilment of the objectives in the various areas of the business plan, which include sustainability and\n\u2014 assessment of leadership and compliance with values\n\nFor the last two performance parameters it is the individual\u2019s performance within their own area of responsibility that is assessed. For the financial targets, the assessment is to be based on the most recent financial year. The board of directors is responsible for this assessment in the case of short-term variable remuneration to the CEO. In the case of short-term variable remuneration to other senior executives, the CEO is responsible for the assessment.\n\nEach of these four predetermined performance parameters has equal weighting, i.e. each represents a quarter of the total target fulfilment. However, there is a threshold value for the second parameter, i.e. operating profit, which means that if this value is not reached then no short-term variable remuneration will be paid regardless of target fulfilment for the other three parameters. The short-term variable remuneration, which at individual level is based on the extent to which the person\u2019s duties and position influence the overall development of the group, may amount to 0\u20133 months\u2019 salary, 0\u20136 months\u2019 salary or 0\u201312 months\u2019 salary. Monthly salary refers to fixed basic cash salary. If the target levels set by the board are fulfilled, half of the maximum remuneration in each range shall be paid. To receive a payment in the higher part of the range within the set framework, therefore, the predetermined target levels are required to be exceeded.\n\nHalf of the remuneration payment shall be invested in H&M shares that must be held for at least three years. Each year the board will set target levels for each of the four performance parameters for the coming year.\n\nLong-term variable remuneration: The long-term variable remuneration shall be based on target fulfilment measured over five financial years starting from the current 2021 financial year and ending at the close of the 2025 financial year. This period, i.e. 1 Dec 2020 \u2013 30 Nov 2025, is known as the measurement period. The long-term variable remuneration \u2013 which shall apply only to the executive management team including the CEO, totalling 15 individuals \u2013 shall be based on fulfilment of targets within the following areas:\n\n\u2014 the H&M group\u2019s total sales\n\u2014 the H&M group\u2019s total operating profit\n\u2014 fulfilment of the objectives in the various areas of the business plan in total, which include sustainability, and\n\u2014 assessment of leadership and compliance with values.\n\nEach of these four predetermined performance parameters shall have equal weighting, i.e. each represents a quarter of the total target fulfilment. For the long-term variable remuneration the assessment of the financial targets shall be based on a summing up of the past five financial years, with fulfilment of the annual target levels in the short-term arrangement \u2013 i.e. within sales and profit \u2013 forming the basis for target fulfilment in the long-term arrangement. For the other two performance parameters \u2013 i.e. fulfilment of the business plan, and leadership and compliance with values \u2013 an overall assessment is to be made of the total for the H&M group for the entire measurement period. After the measurement period has ended the board is responsible for an overall assessment based on the four performance parameters and for deciding the long-term variable remuneration that will be paid to the CEO. The long-term variable remuneration to be paid to other senior executives will be established by the board in consultation with the CEO.\nA precondition for receiving the long-term portion shall be that the participants make an initial investment of their own in H&M shares, amounting to around 10 percent of their fixed basic annual cash salary after tax, close to the 2021 annual general meeting. These shares shall then be held for the entire measurement period. After three years, provided they remain employed by the group, the initial investment will be matched by the receipt of a cash amount after tax equal to two times their own initial outlay. This sum is to be invested in H&M shares as soon as possible. These shares are also to be held for the entire measurement period.\n\nThe aim of the initial investment of their own in H&M shares as well as the investment of the matching sum in H&M shares is to build up their own shareholding in H&M in order thereby to further align the interests of the executive management team with the interests of the shareholders in the good, long-term development of the company.\n\nThe maximum total remuneration within the framework of the long-term variable remuneration arrangement for the entire measurement period, which includes both the matching amount in year 3 and the remuneration in year 5 after the measurement period has ended, may vary between SEK 1.75 million net after tax and SEK 7 million net after tax depending on the individual\u2019s duties and the extent to which their position affects the overall development of the group.\n\nThe H&M group\u2019s total cost, including social security costs, for the long-term variable remuneration is expected to amount to a maximum of around SEK 150 million. A provision of SEK 30 million per year is expected to be made for a total of five years.\n\nPension benefits\nIn the case of the CEO, pension benefits \u2013 including sickness insurance \u2013 are to be on a defined contribution basis. Variable cash remuneration shall not be pensionable. The pension premiums for the year must not exceed 30 percent of the CEO\u2019s annual fixed basic salary.\n\nIn the case of other senior executives, pension benefits \u2013 including sickness insurance \u2013 are to be on a defined contribution basis unless the executive is covered by a defined benefit pension plan under the mandatory provisions of collective bargaining agreements. The pension premiums for the year must not exceed 40 percent of the senior executive\u2019s annual fixed basic salary.\n\nThe cost of the present commitments is partly covered by separate insurance policies.\n\nThe retirement age for the CEO is 65.\n\nThe retirement age for other senior executives varies between 62 and 65 years.\n\nOther benefits\nSenior executives may receive other benefits such as wellness subsidies, car allowances and medical insurance. The total annual costs associated with other benefits must not exceed 20 percent of the individual\u2019s annual fixed basic salary.\n\nTermination of employment\nThe period of notice for senior executives may vary between three and 12 months. Variable remuneration is not to be paid if the individual has given notice to terminate their employment.\n\nThe CEO is entitled to 12 months\u2019 notice. In the event that the company terminates the CEO\u2019s employment contract, a year\u2019s fixed basic cash salary may also be paid to the CEO as severance pay. No other severance pay is payable.\n\nSalary and employment terms for other employees of the company\nWhen preparing the board\u2019s proposed guidelines for remuneration to senior executives consideration was given to the salary and employment terms of the company\u2019s other employees by using information concerning the employees\u2019 total remuneration, the components of the remuneration and the increase in and rate of increase in the remuneration over time as part of the basis on which the board assessed whether the guidelines, and the resulting limitations, are reasonable.\n\nConsultancy fees\nWhere a board member performs work for the company (including through a wholly owned company) in addition to their board work, a separate fee may be paid for this (consultancy fee). Such fee shall not exceed the board fee paid to the member concerned. The fee is to be based on the current market rate and be proportionate to the benefit for the company and the extent to which such work contributes to the good\nfinancial and sustainable development of the H&M group.\n\n**Decision process for establishment, review and implementation of the guidelines**\n\nThe company has no remuneration committee, since the board of directors deems it more appropriate for the entire board to carry out the tasks of a remuneration committee. The board prepares proposed guidelines for remuneration to senior executives and these proposals are presented at the annual general meetings. The board is to prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every four years and submit the proposal for decision by the annual general meeting. The guidelines shall apply until new guidelines have been adopted by the annual general meeting. The board shall also monitor and evaluate programmes for variable remuneration to the company\u2019s management and the application of the guidelines for remuneration to senior executives, as well as current remuneration structures and levels in the company. The board shall further decide on the CEO\u2019s salary in accordance with the guidelines in effect and shall continually evaluate the work of the CEO. Once a year this matter is to be discussed separately in conjunction with the setting of the CEO\u2019s remuneration for the coming year. To avoid conflicts of interest, no member of the company\u2019s management is to be present when the board discusses remuneration matters.\n\n**Other**\n\nSenior executives are also entitled to the benefits accruing under the profit-sharing programme known as the H&M Incentive Program, which is for all employees of the H&M group. The programme was adopted by a previous annual general meeting and is not covered by these guidelines.\n\nRegarding employment terms falling under rules other than Swedish rules, in the case of pension benefits and other benefits the guidelines are to be adapted as appropriate to comply with any such mandatory rules or established local practice, while fulfilling the general aim of the guidelines as far as possible.\n\nThe board may decide to temporarily deviate from the guidelines in full or in part if there is particular reason to do so in an individual case and this is necessary in order to provide for the company\u2019s long-term interests and sustainability or to ensure the financial viability of the company.\n\n**Description of significant changes to the guidelines and how shareholders\u2019 views have been taken into account**\n\nThe pandemic has speeded up many changes in society and the industry that were already driving the H&M group\u2019s transformation. Digitalisation has accelerated and awareness of the importance of sustainable development has increased. In the H&M group\u2019s ongoing transformation it is important to have a good balance between short-term and long-term decisions. The proposed guidelines therefore include supplementary long-term variable remuneration for the executive management team while also clarifying the performance parameters for the short-term variable remuneration. In addition, the relationship between variable and fixed remuneration has been made clearer, and certain other changes have been made. The changes are in line with views presented by shareholders.\n\n**PROPOSAL TO THE 2023 AGM**\n\nThe board is proposing to the 2023 AGM that no changes are made to the guidelines for remuneration of senior executives.\n\n**FINANCING AND LIQUIDITY**\n\nThe H&M group aims to secure financial flexibility and freedom of action on the best possible terms. As previously, the efforts focus on continued improvements in working capital, cash flow and more efficient financing.\n\n**Cash flow and working capital**\n\nCash flow from operating activities for the full year amounted to SEK 24,476 m (44,619). Excluding IFRS 16, cash flow from operating activities amounted to SEK 12,337 m (32,304). Working capital from operating activities amounted to SEK 24,419 m (19,983).\n\n**Liquidity and debt financing**\n\nThe H&M group\u2019s liquidity remains very good. As at 30 November 2022 cash and cash equivalents amounted to SEK 21,707 m (27,471). In addition, the group has undrawn credit facilities of SEK 17,469 m (15,178). The total liquidity buffer, i.e. cash and cash equivalents plus undrawn credit facilities, amounted to SEK 39,176 m (42,649).\n\nInterest-bearing liabilities in the form of commercial papers, bonds and loans from credit institutions amounted to SEK 10,778 m (9,614) as at 30 November 2022. The average maturity of interest-bearing liabilities was 4.3 (5.6) years.\nFinancial net cash amounted to SEK 10,929 m (17,857). Net debt including provisions for pensions and excluding IFRS 16 amounted to SEK -10,596 m (-17,428).\n\nTo improve the maturity structure of the group\u2019s undrawn revolving credit facilities the following financing activities took place in the 2022 financial year:\n\n\u2014 The EUR 700 m credit facility opened in 2017 that expires in 2023 was closed.\n\u2014 Two credit facilities opened in 2020 and expiring in 2023 for a total of SEK 8,000 m were closed.\n\u2014 A five-year sustainability-linked EUR 1,300 m credit facility was opened, with two options to extend for a year at a time.\n\u2014 A three-year sustainability-linked EUR 300 m credit facility was opened, with two options to extend for a year at a time.\n\nA maturity analysis of outstanding interest-bearing liabilities and undrawn credit facilities is given in the table in note 2.\n\nCAPITAL STRUCTURE\nThe H&M group advocates a conservative leverage ratio, aiming for a strong capital structure with strong liquidity and financial flexibility. It is essential that, as in the past, expansion and investments can proceed with continued freedom of action. The capital structure is defined as net debt in relation to EBITDA. It should not exceed 1.0 x EBITDA over time. Net debt/EBITDA excluding IFRS 16 effects was -0.6 (-0.7) as at 30 November 2022.\n\nIFRS 16 Leases, which is being applied from 1 December 2019, has substantial effects on the reporting of liabilities, assets and EBITDA. However, the H&M group will continue to define the capital structure exclusive of IFRS 16 effects. The company considers this to provide a clearer picture of the actual debt/equity ratio, and it is also the measure used in internal monitoring.\n\nDIVIDEND POLICY\nThe board of directors\u2019 intention is for the H&M group to continue to provide shareholders with a good return while ensuring that growth and investments in the business can proceed with a continued strong financial position and freedom of action. Based on this, the board of directors has proposed a dividend policy stating that the ordinary dividend over time is to exceed 50 percent of profit after tax and additionally that identified surplus liquidity \u2013 taking into consideration the capital structure target and investment requirements \u2013 can be distributed to shareholders through an extra dividend or a buyback programme.\n\nProposed distribution of earnings\nThe funds at the disposal of the parent company are SEK 16,009 m. The board of directors is proposing to the annual general meeting 2023 that a dividend of SEK 6.50 per share is paid, totalling SEK 10,593 m, and that the remaining earnings of H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB of SEK 5,416 m are carried forward. The dividend will be paid in cash, split into two instalments. The first payment of SEK 3.25 will be made in May and the second payment of SEK 3.25 will be made in November. The board\u2019s proposed record dates are 8 May 2023 and 10 November 2023. If the resolution is approved at the annual general meeting, the dividend is expected to be paid out on 11 May 2023 and 15 November 2023.\n\nThe board of directors will also ask the 2023 annual general meeting for authorisation allowing it to repurchase the company\u2019s own B shares in the period up to the 2024 annual general meeting for a maximum of SEK 3 billion. The board of directors will wait to see how the company develops during the year and the authorisation will only be used provided that, just as to date, the expansion and investments are able to take place with continued freedom of action and taking into consideration the financial position and capital structure targets of the group and the parent company, as well as the requirements that the nature and extent of the business and its risks and development plans impose on the equity and liquidity of the group and the parent company.\n\nThe board\u2019s assessment is that the proposed distribution of earnings is justifiable taking into consideration the good cash flow, continued strong financial position and ability to make future investments (capex). The proposal takes into consideration the financial position and continued freedom of action of the group and the parent company, the capital structure target and the requirements that the nature and extent of the business and its risks, expansion and development plans impose on the equity and liquidity of the group and the parent company.\nThe board is proposing to the 2023 AGM that a cash dividend of SEK 6.50 per share is paid.\n\n| Description                                                                 | Amount          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| The following funds are at the disposal of the annual general meeting      | SEK 16,009,039,715 |\n| The board proposes a dividend to the shareholders of SEK 6.50 per share    | SEK 10,592,964,441 |\n| To be carried forward as retained earnings                                | SEK 5,416,075,274 |\n| **Total**                                                                 | **SEK 16,009,039,715** |\nStatutory Sustainability Report\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThis report is prepared in accordance with Chapter 6 \u00a7\u00a7 10-14 of the Annual Accounts Act and covers the financial year from 1 December 2021 to 30 November 2022.\n\nH&M Group reports against existing and evolving legislation, including policies developed by the European Union, Germany, Norway and the UK; read more at hmgroup.com/sustainability and in our Sustainability Disclosure. We also report against external frameworks including the Global Reporting Initiative, UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework, and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nThe Statutory Sustainability Report contains information on H&M Group\u2019s sustainability performance, position and results, and the sustainability impact by and on the company\u2019s operations. It includes disclosures on issues relevant to the company\u2019s value chain, including climate and the environment, working conditions, inclusion and diversity, respect for human rights and anti-corruption measures.\n\nMore detail on individual topics can be found in our latest Sustainability Disclosure at hmgroup.com/sustainability, or in other locations linked from relevant places in the text below.\n\nIndicators marked * have been reviewed or partially reviewed by the company\u2019s auditors through a limited assurance process \u2014 the scope is confirmed with footnotes in relevant data tables.\n\nOUR STRATEGY\nWe aim to grow our business in a way that decouples our financial growth and profitability from the use of finite natural resources, so that business and communities can thrive within the planetary boundaries. In early 2022, we strengthened this ambition by introducing a goal to double our sales (from a 2021 baseline) while halving our greenhouse gas emissions (from a 2019 baseline) by 2030. This goal is supported by our existing targets, including our science-based emissions reduction targets, and by short- and medium-term milestones that guide our actions.\n\nOur ambition is to lead the change towards a circular fashion industry with net-zero climate impact, while being a fair and equal company. We will continue to listen to our customers and meet them where they are, while inspiring them to develop a new relationship with fashion.\n\nWe report separately on environmental and social risks but recognise the deep interconnection between people and the planet, as existing inequities and threats to human rights are exacerbated by resource depletion and climate change. Through our strategy, we support progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals and Agenda 2030, alongside other global commitments such as the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the UN Declaration of Human Rights. Learn more about our policies, strategies and performance in our Sustainability Disclosure, Global Reporting Initiative and UN Guiding Principles indexes, Modern Slavery Statement, and other supporting web content at hmgroup.com/sustainability.\n\nInvestments in sustainability provide H&M Group with long-term business opportunities, for example by offering customers new ways to experience fashion with less negative environmental or social impacts than traditional linear (make-use-dispose) business models. In a changing world facing significant social and environmental challenges and resource constraints, our work to improve our materials sourcing, processes and products also helps us to build resilience as a business and throughout our supply chain. See page 16 for details about our business model and page 31 for the business opportunities connected to the shift towards a circular, net-zero fashion industry.\n\nOur strategy is underpinned by our commitment to respect human rights. It guides how we play our part in tackling climate change, supporting biodiversity, avoiding natural resource depletion and reducing social inequality. These and other risks to our business, the planet and people connected to our value chain are all interlinked. We engage with our stakeholders \u2014 who also represent or are themselves \u201crights holders\u201d \u2014 as part of our process to determine material issues and key risks to human rights, and to mitigate these.\n\nFind details of our operational risks on pages 76-78, our climate-related risks in our reporting against Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures recommendations on page 103-107, and our risks to people in our Salient Human Rights Issues analysis at https://hmgroup.com/sustainability/fair-and-equal/human-rights/.\nTRANSPARENCY\n\nTransparency is central to our strategy. While not a direct indicator of sustainability performance, increased disclosure creates accountability and comparability.\n\nThis year the fashion industry has faced increased scrutiny over sustainability claims. While brands have responded to increasing customer demands for product sustainability information, the lack of robust data systems, harmonised legislation and a standardised approach to sustainability claims have hindered true accountability and comparability. Together with peers and stakeholders, H&M Group is working to improve this, by testing and piloting new ways of tracing materials and collecting and sharing data.\n\nWe welcome the positive shift towards clearer guidance and increased transparency, which can only be achieved through improved data collection and traceability. Our intention is to continue providing impact data to customers and other stakeholders, to incentivise and drive positive change in the industry. H&M Group remains committed to increasing our level of transparency. We work to continually improve the comparability and quality of the data, systems and calculations we use.\n\nRead about H&M Group\u2019s commitment to transparency on page 22 and in our Sustainability Disclosure at hmgroup.com/sustainability.\n\nOUR VALUE CHAIN\n\nOur value chain includes the full range of activities required to plan, design, source, process and manufacture, transport, market, sell, use, rent, reuse and recycle our products.\n\nWe continually evolve our value chain to become more customer centric and aligned with our sustainability vision \u2014 moving from a linear system toward an ecosystem where resources recirculate between different people and partners. We are developing reverse supply chains to recover resources from our production processes or collect used garments and feed these back into making new products. We are also investing in new ways to bring products to our customers, such as reselling pre-owned products. These efforts help us to build more resilient supply chains and business models, and strengthen our customer experience. We work with several supply chains, including:\n\n\u2014 Production supply chain: Suppliers that contribute to making the apparel, footwear, homeware and beauty products we sell through our brands.\n\n\u2014 Services supply chain: Suppliers that provide services such as landlords, cleaning, construction, warehouse operations and transportation.\n\n\u2014 Other supply chains & business partners: Such as administration, business services, procurement, and communications and marketing services.\n\nThe size and scale of our business connects us to people, communities, natural systems, peers and other businesses and organisations globally. We work with approximately 500 commercial product suppliers for the H&M brand and portfolio brands. These suppliers operate approximately 1,200 manufacturing units and final product processing units (collectively called supplier factories) for apparel, footwear, accessories, home interior products, furniture and beauty products. H&M Group has 15 production offices across major sourcing markets. We have 4,465 stores in 78 markets and 58 online markets.\n\nAcross our entire value chain, we aim to maximise positive impacts and minimise negative ones \u2014 guided by our values, policies and long-term business and sustainability goals. In line with our strategy, we work to secure human rights, have a positive social impact on people in our operations and supply chain, promote inclusion and diversity, and reduce resource use and negative impacts on climate, water, land and biodiversity.\n\nSUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE\n\nStructures & accountability\n\nOur head of sustainability together with the executive management team are responsible for implementing the company\u2019s sustainability vision. The head of sustainability and of each function and brand reports directly to the CEO or CFO, including information on sustainability key performance indicators (KPIs). For further details on our corporate governance, see page 55.\n\nAccountability for implementation and performance against our strategies, policies and goals is integrated into key roles and responsibilities in our respective business functions and brands, and forms part of their performance review with our CEO. Our business functions and brands are supported by 37 experts and 11 managers in our global Sustainability Department.\nOur Sustainability Department gives quarterly progress reports against sustainability KPIs, key challenges, learnings and activities \u2014 facilitating visibility of impacts, achievements and challenges across functions, brands and markets. In addition, the head of sustainability reports a performance overview to the board of directors biannually.\n\nA total of 346 people across the group have sustainability as their core task, and we continue to integrate sustainability into wider roles across H&M Group. We connect management remuneration to sustainability performance.\n\nWe engage with external and internal stakeholders to ensure material issues and human rights risks are identified, prioritised and incorporated into the company\u2019s strategies and procedures. Engagement with stakeholders also informs our risk management process, which we have strengthened this year to ensure greater integration with our corporate governance processes.\n\n**Due diligence & risk management**\n\nOur commitments to respect and advance human rights and to reduce environmental impact are central to our due diligence. We have integrated our human rights due diligence process further into our corporate governance and risk management processes, to ensure our business decisions consider the potential for impacts to the rights holders affected by our business. We recognise the interconnectedness between environmental issues such as climate change, resource use, biodiversity and water scarcity, and human rights and livelihoods.\n\nWe are continuing to evolve our risk-based human rights due diligence process, which applies to our operations, value chain and the communities where we operate. This process is based on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles. We pay special attention to groups vulnerable to infringement of rights, such as migrant workers and children. We do not accept forced labour or child labour.\n\nWe identify and manage human rights risks in our value chain through the following steps:\n\n\u2014 **Policy development.** We develop, update and apply relevant human rights policies and standards to our daily business operations, including internal social policies and the Sustainability Commitment for suppliers and business partners.\n\n\u2014 **Due diligence.** We engage in ongoing due diligence to identify and assess human rights risks and impacts, and to prevent, mitigate and remedy issues in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).\n\u2014 **Grievance mechanisms and incident management.** We strive to support grievances to be handled and addressed as close to the issue as possible \u2014 and for grievance and remediation processes to be transparent, trusted and accessible for the intended user. Our Internal Grievance Policy outlines one of our internal processes, and we expect business partners to have similar operational-level grievance mechanisms in place. Since 2022, anyone can raise and escalate concerns using our Speak Up channel \u2014 our corporate complaints channel \u2014 for reporting suspected misconduct across our value chain. The channel supports anonymous reporting and we do not tolerate retaliation toward the person reporting.\n\n\u2014 **Stakeholder engagement.** We engage with stakeholders (rights holders), including workers, employees, customers, employers, unions, human rights experts and civil society. Read more about our stakeholder engagement activities at hmgroup.com/sustainability.\n\n\u2014 **Training.** We provide human rights training, tailored to our different functions and roles. This includes a basic introduction to human rights, an outline of the company\u2019s responsibilities in line with the UNGP, and an explanation of due diligence and management processes. It also includes topic-specific training for parts of the organisation, such as awareness raising on specific topics such as forced labour and fair recruitment of migrant workers, health and safety, inclusion and diversity, data privacy and child rights.\n\nRead more about our operational risks \u2014 including risks related to sustainability, cybersecurity and data protection, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, and reputational risks \u2014 on pages 76-78. Read our Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting on pages 103-107 for more information on climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\n**Supply chain management**\n\nWe have historically focused largely on driving environmental and social progress in our production supply chain as this is where we have the biggest impact. We are increasingly working more closely with our other supply chains, taking the same systematic approach to identifying the most significant risks to the environment and human rights and addressing them through policies, partnerships and continuous improvement.\n\nAll business partners need to comply with our Code of Ethics, and requirements relating to environment and human rights standards. For our major supply chains these requirements are spelled out in our Sustainability Commitment. The Code of Ethics also outlines a zero-tolerance policy on corruption and requires business partners and employees to comply with relevant legislation as well as our own business principles.

Through SIPP, we assess supplier factories against tools developed by the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC) together with the industry, academia, NGOs and others. These tools are the Higg Facility Environmental Module (FEM) and Higg Facility Social and Labor Module (FSLM). See below for supplier SIPP, FEM, FSLM coverage, third-party verification coverage, and FEM scores. We continue to engage with the SAC and peers to advocate for and develop an impact-focused FSLM industry scoring tool.\n\nThrough our Sustainability Index and other business KPIs we identify and reward high-performing suppliers with better business prospects. It includes consideration of suppliers\u2019 FEM/FSLM assessment results and performance data.\n\nRead about how we work with suppliers \u2014 including our production supply chain and other supply chains \u2014 and our supply chain performance in our Sustainability Disclosure at hmgroup.com/sustainability.\n\n### CIRCULARITY, CLIMATE & NATURE\n\n**Risks & opportunities**\n\nEnvironmental risks to our business, value chain, communities and the planet include depletion of natural resources, climate change, biodiversity loss, land use change, water impacts, and changing consumption patterns. Many environmental risks are closely connected to human rights risks \u2014 for example land rights and livelihoods, the right to access clean water and the impact of climate change on communities that already have inequitable access to resources or finance. Find further details on our operational risks on pages 76-78. Read our Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting on pages 103-107 for more information on climate-related risks and opportunities \u2014 including physical risks from climate change and risks and opportunities associated with the transition to a lower-carbon economy.\n\nAs customer preferences continue to evolve, we see an increased relevance and opportunity to engage with this key group of stakeholders on environmental topics. Our focus is on further accelerating investment in products, supply chains and customer journeys that support a circular, net-zero fashion sector. There is increased potential to create positive impact and longer-lasting relationships with customers by offering services throughout products\u2019 lifecycles that increase product value and use.\n\nIdentifying, investing in, testing and scaling innovative materials and processes, planning accuracy, and new ways to access fashion will further improve the\nresilience of our business and supply chain by reducing dependence on limited natural resources. It will also support our commitment to respect and advance human rights and contribute to more favourable environmental conditions for communities and people.\n\nFind further explanation of the company\u2019s focus on circularity, climate and nature in our Sustainability Disclosure at hmgroup.com. See page 31 in this report for more details on how the company connects sustainability to our customer offering.\n\n**Strategy & policies**\n\nWe identify and capture opportunities and manage risks through our Circularity, Climate and Nature strategy, which focuses on:\n\n\u2014 **Climate and nature.** We are working to achieve our science-based target of net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our value chain by 2040, reach a 30 percent reduction in absolute total freshwater use by 2030, ensure wastewater quality, and contribute to the global goal to have a positive impact on nature in line with the ARRTT (Avoid, Reduce, Restore, Regenerate, Transform) framework.\n\n\u2014 **Resource use and circularity.** We are committed to move from a linear to a circular ecosystem, where resources are kept in use for as long as possible, to support the decoupling of our business growth from resource use. We seek to use circular design and use recycled, regenerative or other sustainably sourced materials, alongside investing to scale the repair, reuse, remake and recycling of products, packaging and non-commercial goods. Read more about how we define these terms in our Sustainability Disclosure at hmgroup.com/sustainability.\n\nThese two focus areas are closely connected. Our work to improve material sourcing and shift to more circular business models supports our climate, water, biodiversity and chemicals goals.\n\nLearn more about our Circularity, Climate and Nature strategy in our Sustainability Disclosure at hmgroup.com/sustainability. For more details on related policies and standards, visit hmgroup.com.\n\nNet-zero, as defined by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), focuses on reducing emissions as far as possible before removing emissions that cannot be avoided. By aiming for net-zero we focus on reducing our absolute climate impact, supported by our public affairs work and collaboration to effect wider climate progress.\n\n**Performance**\n\nThe Circularity, Climate & Nature KPI table (see page 92) features indicators selected to offer an overview of our performance. Here, we share additional details:\n\nWe continued to work towards net-zero emissions across our value chain:\n\n\u2014 Our scope 1 and 2 emissions decreased by 8 percent, compared to our 2019 baseline (an increase of 18 percent compared to last year) and our scope 3 emissions decreased by 7 percent, compared to our 2019 baseline (a decrease of 4 percent compared to last year). The increase in scope 1 and 2 emissions compared to last year was largely a result of the reduction in the share of renewable electricity purchased in 2022. This is primarily due to us not purchasing renewable electricity certificates in Russia, and to some degree sourcing challenges in a few other markets. A historic undercalculation due to use of an incorrect conversion factor for natural gas calculations also caused part of this increase in emissions. Read more about changes to our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions reporting at hmgroup.com/sustainability/sustainability-reporting/how-we-report/.\n\n\u2014 Use of renewable electricity in our own operations was 92 percent (compared to 95 percent in 2021). The reduction in renewable electricity purchasing in 2022 is due to us not purchasing renewable energy certificates in Russia this year, and to some degree sourcing challenges in a few other markets.\n\n\u2014 We no longer onboard any new suppliers or supplier factories if they have on-site coal boilers in their facilities \u2014 as part of a longer-term aim to phase out coal from our supply chain. Supplier factories reporting use of on-site coal boilers dropped to 70% (91 in 2021) due to factors including our phase-out of on-site coal, changes in our supplier base, local policy, and H&M Group pushing for increased electrification of steam. We are working closely with supplier partners and local stakeholders in our production countries to accelerate total substitution.\n\nBased on Q3 data.\nof coal, as well as financially supporting suppliers to transition to solar PV, solar thermal, and thermal energy from agricultural residues. This will make a significant contribution to reaching our absolute GHG emissions reduction goal.\n\nOur total 2022 spend on decarbonisation \u2014 including, for example, energy efficiency investments in our stores, supporting our suppliers to phase out coal and increasing the share of more sustainably sourced materials \u2014 was approximately SEK 2.6 billion.\n\nIn 2021, we issued a EUR 500 million sustainability-linked bond with the aim of financing \u2014 among other things \u2014 an accelerated transition to recycled materials and reduction of GHG emissions (scope 1, 2 and 3) in our supply chain. The bond was 7.6\ntimes oversubscribed and the interest rate is tied to how well we succeed at achieving the recycled materials and GHG emissions reduction targets. Read more about our sustainability-linked bond at hmgroup.com.\n\n\u2014 We joined the LEAF (Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance) Coalition, which brings together the private sector and governments to reduce emissions by protecting tropical and subtropical forests. We also entered into our first contract for permanent carbon dioxide removal (CDR), via a multi-year agreement with Climeworks using direct air capture and storage.\n\n\u2014 We partnered on a range of projects to introduce regenerative practices in agriculture, which encourage plant and diversity, restore soil health and biodiversity, and support the livelihoods of local communities. For example, through our three-year partnership with BKB and Textile Exchange in South Africa, we aim to introduce regenerative practices across more than 500,000 hectares, support land conservation and restoration, monitor outcomes on 500 hectares of land and deliver training to 1,000 BKB farmers.\n\n\u2014 We worked with the Textile Exchange\u2019s Leather Impact Accelerator (LIA) to devise a framework for best practices in leather supply chains and prevent deforestation practices in supplier farms.\n\n\u2014 We have achieved a 21% water recycling rate and 21% improvement in water efficiency in our supply chain, compared to a 2017 baseline. This equates to a combined overall 38% relative water consumption reduction \u2014 close to our 40% goal, despite the challenges of regaining momentum in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, 49% of our facilities now harvest rainwater, against our goal of 50%.\n\n\u2014 We had challenges in meeting our goal for 100% functional effluent treatment plants (ETPs) with \u201cgreen\u201d grading and compliance with wastewater quality. Our investigations identified key remediation actions relating to operation control, which we will execute in the coming years. These include engaging a third-party wastewater engineering company for ETP assessments in India, Bangladesh and T\u00fcrkiye, raising our minimum requirement bar to \u201cgreen\u201d graded ETPs only from 1st of Jan 2023, and raising our wastewater quality requirements.\n\n\u2014 We launched our new Water Strategy 2030 as the next step following our 2018-22 Water Roadmap. The new strategy marks a shift away from relative water efficiency to focus on absolute water use reduction, which will measure how well we decouple growth from resource consumption. We have set contextual water targets guided by local basin and operational issues in each of our facilities, and such targets include quality, governance, access to water and sanitation (WASH) and flooding risk. We will report on progress against these targets starting from next year.\n\n\u2014 We sourced 84 percent recycled or other more sustainably sourced materials in our commercial goods compared to 80 percent in 2021. This further progress towards our 100 percent goal is largely due to an increase in the use of recycled materials such as cotton and polyester.\n\n\u2014 We set a long-term materials vision to move towards a resilient and circular material sector that stays within planetary boundaries, supports human rights and livelihoods, and thrives on innovation\u2014with the pillars of recycled, regenerative and responsible sourcing.\n\n\u2014 Our use of plastic packaging has decreased by 44 percent compared to our 2018 baseline (compared to 28 percent in 2021), as a result of ongoing focus on addressing problematic packaging such as hangers and plastic bags. We are not reporting our overall percentage change in packaging this year, since we are in the process of revising this goal and our packaging strategy \u2014 including calculating a new baseline figure for the overall amount of packaging used.\n\n\u2014 Overall, 85 percent of our packaging used recycled or other more sustainably sourced materials, compared to 68 percent in 2021.\n\n\u2014 In support of our aim to design all our products for circularity by 2025, we are testing and developing tools and methods including our circular product\n\n13) Permanent carbon dioxide removals for use under the net-zero standard are currently being defined by the SBTi, but will likely mean those that have a durability of >1000 years.\n\n14) In accordance with our Circulator tool.\ndevelopment tool and guide, Circulator. Integrating new ways of working to design for circularity requires a mindset shift, which is a long process. There are challenges with securing early-stage data that enables Circulator\u2019s predictive assessment, and we are exploring how to update our way of working to obtain this. We will focus on further developing and expanding Circulator to other product types, while building knowledge and increasing the circular potential of our products.\n\n\u2014 We continued to expand access to the resell platform Sellpy. In 2022, more than eight million second-hand items were traded on the site across 24 markets.\n\n\u2014 We collected 14,768 tonnes of material via the existing H&M Group garment collecting initiative in 2022 (15,944 tonnes in 2021; 18,800 tonnes in 2020).\u00b9\n\n\u00b9) Our garment collecting initiative was disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic for part of the year in 2020 and for the full year in 2021. Since March 2022, our garment collecting has been paused in Ukraine, Russia & Belarus.\n\nFor details on these KPIs as well as performance against other areas of the company\u2019s environmental strategy, see our Sustainability Disclosure at hmgroup.com/sustainability.\n\nREPORTING IN LINE WITH ARTICLE 8 OF THE EU TAXONOMY REGULATION\n\nDuring 2022, H&M Group performed an inventory of its activities according to article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. The EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act currently covers sectors in which H&M Group does not operate. Economic activities for our industry sector are therefore not classified as taxonomy-eligible with regard to the first two environmental objectives \u2014 climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. H&M Group has, however, identified several crosscutting (non-business related) activities that we consider to be eligible for CapEx and OpEx reporting according to the regulation.\n\nH&M Group applied the precautionary principle to our assessment, and activities that are not material for H&M Group have been left out.\n\nPROPORTION OF TURNOVER FROM PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH TAXONOMY-ALIGNED ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES - DISCLOSURE COVERING YEAR 2022\n\n| Economic Activities | Codes (2) | Absolute Turnover (3) | Proportion of Turnover (4) | Substantial Contribution Criteria |\n|---------------------|-----------|-----------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                     |           | Currency %            | %                         | Climate Change Mitigation (5) %  |\n|                     |           |                       |                           | Climate Change Adaptation (6) %  |\n|                     |           |                       |                           | Water and marine Resources (7) %|\n|                     |           |                       |                           | Circular Economy (8) %           |\n|                     |           |                       |                           | Pollution (9) %                  |\n|                     |           |                       |                           | Biodiversity and Ecosystems (10) %|\n| A.

These are the company\u2019s LED fitting project, under activity 7.3, and all new and renegotiated right of use assets, under activity 7.7. For activity 7.3, the change to energy efficient light fittings was determined eligible according to the relevant technical criteria. For activity 7.7, right of use assets fall under eligible activity classification relating to leased usage of potentially aligned premises. All other eligible activities have been deemed immaterial.\n\nFor further information about CapEx, please see the H&M Group balance report on page 110.\n\n**OpEx**\n\nH&M Group owns very few buildings and seldom controls more than 30% of the premises in a building. Based on this, very little of the relevant taxonomy OpEx is eligible and deemed material. No OpEx has therefore been allocated to any eligible activity. In H&M Group\u2019s reporting, the total OpEx includes repair and maintenance, as well as R&D expenses.\n\nFor further information about OpEx, please see the H&M Group income statement on page 108.\n\n**Assessment of compliance**\n\nH&M Group has applied EU Taxonomy accounting rules for Turnover, CapEx and OpEx and has identified several cross-cutting (non-economic) activities that fall within the scope for the Apparel and Footwear sector.\n### PROPORTION OF CAPEX FROM PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH TAXONOMY-ALIGNED ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES - DISCLOSURE COVERING YEAR 2022\n\n| Economic Activities | Code (1) | Absolute CapEx (2) | Proportion of CapEx (3) |\n|---------------------|----------|--------------------|------------------------|\n| **A.

Any eligible activities have therefore been deemed immaterial.\n\n7.3 Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficient equipment.\nH&M Group is undertaking various energy efficiency projects, many of which are immaterial or of financial support rather than investment nature. H&M Group has, however, carried out an LED project that entails changing all lights to energy efficient LED fittings in all H&M Group stores. This project falls under the EU Taxonomy activity 7.3 description, and is therefore included in our taxonomy reporting.\n\n7.6 Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies.\nH&M Group is undertaking various renewable energy projects, most of which are immaterial or of financial support rather than investment nature and are not included in CapEx. Any other eligible activities have been deemed immaterial.\n\n7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings.\nH&M Group owns very few buildings and no new buildings have been acquired or constructed during 2022. Any eligible activities have therefore been deemed immaterial. H&M Group does, however, have an extensive amount of right of use assets, as all H&M Group\u2019s store locations are leased. All of H&M Group\u2019s new or renegotiated right of use assets are reported.\n\nActivities falling under CapEx related to products and services purchased from third parties, including right of use assets, cannot currently be verified as aligned with the criteria for significant contribution and do no significant harm, and are therefore reported as eligible.\n\nFor more information on H&M Group\u2019s requirements on minimum social safeguards, please see the Statutory Sustainability Report on page 86.\n\nSOCIAL IMPACT\nRisks & opportunities\nSocial risks to people and human rights across our value chain are primarily linked to working conditions, inclusion, diversity, impacts on communities connected to environmental degradation, and vulnerable groups at greater risk of human rights violations.\n\nOur commitment to respect internationally recognised human rights is the foundation of everything we do. We base our approach on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and communicate our commitment via our Human Rights Policy, available at hmgroup.com. Our actions are primarily focused on the human rights at risk of the most severe negative impact linked to our business, our salient issues. For more details on our Salient Human Rights Issues analysis see https://hmgroup.com/sustainability/fair-and-equal/human-rights/. See also pages 76-78 for further details on our operational risks.\n\nThe people involved in our value chain are essential to our success as a business. By upholding their rights, working to ensure fair and decent jobs, and promoting inclusion and diversity, we attract and retain talent, and help individuals to reach their potential. A diverse, inclusive workforce helps the company to create a relevant and relatable customer offering.\n\nThere is much room for improvement on social impact and human rights in the garment and textile sector. At the same time, the fashion industry provides millions of entry-level jobs, especially for women, and contributes to economic development in emerging and evolving communities. We recognise the importance of responsible business conduct by our industry and our company, to both respect and advance human rights where we operate.\n\nStrategy & policies\nWe have a responsibility to respect the rights of everyone involved in and affected by our value chain, driven by our commitment to be a fair and equal company. We work to accelerate positive impacts and inclusion and equality for all those impacted by our business and value chain, with a focus on labour rights, the unequal treatment of people, and human rights negatively impacted by resource use or environmental degradation.\n\nAs part of our due diligence process, we regularly review who the rights holders are across our value chain and how they could be impacted by our business, updating our salient issues accordingly. Our supply chain management programme enables us to assess, address and remedy human rights issues at the supplier level. We focus our strategies on tackling the issues with greatest risk of negative impacts on people:\nFAIR & EQUAL KPIS\n\n| KPI | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | GOAL |\n|-----|------|------|------|------|\n| **Own operations:** % of employees agreeing with the statement \u201cI am treated with respect and dignity\u201d | 80 | 83 | 84 | Annual increase |\n| **Own operations:** % of female employees, in management positions and on the board of directors | Employees: 74 | Employees: 74 | Employees: 75 | Monitor |\n| | Management: 71 | Management: 71 | Management: 75 | |\n| | Board: 67 | Board: 55 | Board: 55 | |\n| **Own operations:** % of employees that have received our Layers inclusion and diversity training | - | - | - | Monitor |\n| **Supply chain:** % of tier 1 supplier factories that have trade union representation | 32 | 37 | 42 | Monitor |\n| **Supply chain:** % of tier 1 supplier factories that have collective bargaining agreements in place | 18 | 27 | 34 | Monitor |\n| **Supply chain:** % of tier 1 supplier factories with Health and Safety Committees in place | - | - | 98 | Monitor |\n| **Supply chain:** % of female workers, supervisors, and worker representatives in our tier 1 supplier factories | Workers: 63 | Workers: 63 | Workers: 62 | See footnote 6 |\n| | Supervisors: 24 | Supervisors: 28 | Supervisors: 27 | |\n| | Representatives: 59 | Representatives: 62 | Representatives: 63 | |\n| **Community investment initiatives:** total number of beneficiaries and total value of contributions | - | Beneficiaries: 368,000 | Beneficiaries: 745,517 | Monitor |\n| | Contributions: SEK 180.4 million | Contributions: SEK 114.2 million | |\n\n1) We continue to update the selection of KPIs reported in this statutory report to provide a more meaningful overview of our key human rights and social focus areas. Additional KPIs and data are disclosed in our Sustainability Disclosure at hmgroup.com/sustainability.\n\n2) At H&M Group we recognise that gender is not binary and that gender identities exist between and outside of male and female. We are investigating how we can adapt our systems to be more inclusive of all genders, while also complying with local laws and regulations. Meanwhile we will continue to report on the data we have available today.\n\n3) We updated this KPI in 2022 to report the % of employees across brands and functions participating in our Layers training. We removed the separate figure for markets, since there is such a high degree of overlap with the data from brands.\n\n4) Applicable legal standards include: the ILO core conventions; C87 Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention, 1948; C98 Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949. Where these standards have not yet been ratified, following Social & Labor Convergence Program verification guidelines, we referred to the national applicable legislation in force.\n\n5) New KPI introduced in 2022.\n\n6) Increasing the share of female supervisors and worker representatives is an ambition in the group\u2019s Women\u2019s Empowerment Strategy for the production supply chain. The baseline was established in 2020 and the aim is for yearly increases.\n\n7) Includes in-kind giving SEK 50.3 million, cash contributions SEK 52.7 million, management overheads SEK 9.0 million, employee volunteering SEK 2.1 million.\n\n---\n\n**Social impact in our own operations and supply chains.** We focus on supporting the people working in our operations and supply chains \u2014 with a focus on our production supply chain \u2014 so that they can experience decent, meaningful jobs with fair compensation and benefits in safe, secure workplaces free from discrimination, where everyone has the right to freedom of association. Our work is aligned with the International Labour Organization (ILO)\u2019s Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and informed by its definition of decent work, alongside other external guidance.\n\n**Inclusion and diversity.** We are committed to creating inclusive, diverse and equitable workplaces in our operations and supply chains. Together with our brands, we promote diversity and equality through products and communication, and advance inclusion in our communities.\n\n**Community engagement.** We partner with others to improve social and environmental impacts in local communities where we operate, and to advance the rights of wider communities of people.\n\n**Working towards a circular, net-zero fashion industry.** The state of the natural environment fundamentally impacts people\u2019s wellbeing and equitable access to essential resources. By exploring the social implications and opportunities of a future fashion sector, we can enable a just transition to a circular, net-zero industry, alongside supporting communities, supply chains and our business to be more resilient against the effects of climate change.\nWe report in line with regulatory frameworks such as the UK and Australia Modern Slavery Acts and the Norwegian Transparency Act; learn more about the company\u2019s statement at hmgroup.com/sustainability.

For details on related policies and standards, visit hmgroup.com.\n\nPerformance\nThe Fair & Equal KPI table (see page 99) features indicators selected to offer an overview of our performance. Here, we share additional details:\n\n\u2014 We made our Sustainability Commitment for Business Partners more pertinent to different operational contexts and experiences by tailoring it to different functions and groups \u2014 such as manufacturing, construction and facility services, landlords, warehouse operations and transport. These updated versions are being rolled out across the Group.\n\n\u2014 To go beyond local labour laws and harmonise our approach across the group, we reviewed and updated our Social Policies for our own operations \u2014 guided by international standards, such as the ILO core conventions.\n\n\u2014 Despite unionisation rates decreasing worldwide, particularly in our sector, rates in our factories have remained stable. 42 percent of our tier 1 supplier factories have trade union representation and 34 percent have collective bargaining agreements in place (CBAs).\n\n\u2014 We made more than 99% of our payments to suppliers on time. On average suppliers get paid in around 15 days after invoicing and delivery of goods. This is partly a result of a favourable factoring arrangement negotiated by H&M Group on behalf of our suppliers. We continued to itemise labour costs for our orders by dividing production costs into different costing blocks such as material, labour and product treatments, like printing or washing. This costing calculation improves the visibility of labour costs and allows improved wages to be reflected in the prices we pay to our suppliers.\n\nMore than 99% of our apparel orders are processed in this manner.1\n\n\u2014 This year, 89 percent of tier 1 production suppliers surveyed said they regard H&M Group as a fair business partner.\n\n\u2014 We are shifting our activities from measuring the presence of workplace dialogue programmes and wage management systems (which does not in itself ensure positive impact) towards more holistic strategies focused on positive outcomes and impacts. Workers are aware of the processes in place for grievance handling in 98% of in-scope tier 1 supplier factories, and 95% of factories have grievance mechanisms created through social dialogue between unions or worker representative structures and management.2\n\n\u2014 In response to last year\u2019s ACT (Action, Collaboration, Transformation)-facilitated self-assessment on purchasing practices, we implemented the first of five purchasing practices trainings for buying and planning functions across our brands. 498 colleagues in relevant roles,3 completed training module 1, which covers H&M Group\u2019s role and commitments as a member of ACT as well as our responsibilities in improving working conditions across our supply chain.\n\n\u2014 We launched a new global inclusion and diversity (I&D) dashboard to track key indicators to help us identify relevant actions and set local targets to track our progress. Local initiatives may include training completion, gender pay assessments, talent acquisition processes, and increasing equitable representation within the workforce across gender, age and nationality. At the end of 2022, our total workforce was 75:25 female:male and our leadership was 75:25 female:male.4 Our workforce spans across several generations: Generation Z (1997-2015) accounts for 25.7 percent, Millennials (1981-1996) 61.2 percent, Generation\n\n1) To enable differentiation of costing blocks, we rely on information by our suppliers. Previously, we have reported on the percentage of orders placed using a fact-based costing tool which has helped us to verify costs and separate labour costs. While this is one way of measuring, we have learnt that we need to explore additional methods to get the full picture. We will continue to work to further improve tracking of labour-cost ringfencing working together with relevant stakeholders.\n\n2) Figures are based on FSLM data provided by factory management and are not verified by worker surveys.\n\n3) Business-, brand- and product-developers, controllers, buyers, merchandising teams, capacity teams, business governance teams and our sustainability team.\n\n4) At H&M Group we recognize that gender is not binary and that gender identities exist between and outside of male and female. We are investigating how we can adapt our systems to be more inclusive of all genders, while also complying with local laws and regulations. Meanwhile we will continue to report on the data we have available today.\nX (1965-1980) 11.4 percent, and Baby Boomers (1946-1964) 1.7 percent. Our colleagues represent 174 nationalities, with leaders who manage people representing 96 nationalities.5\n\n\u2014 We worked with suppliers to promote their ownership of gender equality objectives and strategies to help them define and implement their own approaches for greater female representation. We now score suppliers on three dimensions: ratio of women workers employed, ratio of women supervisors and gender pay gap.\n\n\u2014 We reached more than 414,000 supply chain workers with activities and training on gender-based violence and sexual harassment (GBVH).\n\n\u2014 We contributed SEK 114.2 million6 to community investment initiatives, reaching 745,517 beneficiaries.\n\nFor more details about these KPIs as well as performance against other areas of the company\u2019s social strategy, see our Sustainability Disclosure at hmgroup.com/sustainability.\n\nANTI-CORRUPTION & ANTI-BRIBERY\nRisks & opportunities\nThe H&M Group company values guide us to act with respect, integrity, transparency and honesty. This is both the right thing to do and essential to our ongoing business success.\n\nCorruption risks exist in many of the markets in which the company and its suppliers operate. We map corruption risk across our operations through annual risk assessments and audits, and identify the greatest risks based on location or type of operation. Through our risk assessment process, we first identify and document the risk before assessing it and deciding our response. We then put appropriate follow-up actions in place and set a timeframe for reviewing the risk. Violations of our Code of Ethics and concerns submitted via the H&M Group Speak Up channel are additional sources of risk identification. We supplement this analysis by using insights from additional metrics such as Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index and from global risk consultancies.\n\nTackling the risk of corruption benefits us by strengthening our business ethics and corporate culture, and enhancing our reputation with stakeholders. Find further details on our operational risks on pages 76-78.\n\nStrategy & policies\nOur Ethics & Compliance and Anti-Corruption programme is our main tool for mitigating risks. The programme includes:\n\n\u2014 Code of Ethics Policy. Our Code of Ethics details the company\u2019s expectations of employees and business partners when conducting business for and on behalf of the group. The code includes details of our zero-tolerance policy on bribery and corruption, which applies to all business dealings in all countries in which the company and its partners operate. It is mandatory that all our business partners, and all employees in contact with them, comply with the Code of Ethics.\n\n\u2014 Training and awareness. We provide training to employees and business partners on our Code of Ethics. Employees can access the company\u2019s Code of Ethics training, Speak Up channel and policies through our Ethics Portal.\n\n\u2014 Reporting concerns.

All company risks are reviewed by the board at least once per year. The board monitors implementation of strategies within the sustainability area and initiates changes and updates where needed. These procedures and governance mechanisms enable the board to maintain close oversight of the company\u2019s sustainability and climate-related performance, and to ensure sufficient management focus and resource allocation. Implementation of all company sustainability strategies, including our climate strategy, is the responsibility of the head of sustainability together with the executive management team. The head of sustainability reports directly to the CEO and provides biannual updates on our sustainability key performance indicators (KPIs) to the board of directors and quarterly KPI updates to the CEO and CFO. See also the Corporate Governance Report and read more about our risk management processes on pages 67 and 76-77.\n\nStrategy\nIn 2019 we performed a risk analysis following the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosure (TCFD) recommendations. This analysis has then been updated during 2021 and 2022. We focused predominantly on two scenarios:\n\n- The rapid transition scenario (RCP 2.6, mostly short- and medium-term). In this scenario the world manages to drastically reduce GHG emissions through several far-reaching measures, such as legislation, global carbon taxes, and major shifts in consumption patterns and lifestyles. This would limit the average temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\n- The accelerating temperature increase scenario (RCP 8.5, mostly long-term). In this scenario the world fails to curb rising GHG emissions. In the long term (to 2100), this results in a global average temperature increase of at least 3-4\u00b0C. Legislation and carbon taxes are expected to play a less significant role in this scenario. Impacts from extreme weather events are assumed to grow in magnitude.\n\nIn our scenarios, we analysed possible impacts in the short term (1-3 years), medium term (in around 10 years) and long term (in around 30 years).\n\nThe risk analysis was performed by mapping our value chain, before conducting several workshops to evaluate and rank risks in all parts of the value chain. The main areas analysed were raw material sourcing, production, logistics, sales, and customers (including more general transition risks such as taxes and legislation). Business opportunities related to climate change were also discussed and evaluated in the workshops. The results of the risk analysis are summarised in the following tables:\n\nThe rapid transition scenario\nRCP2.6, mostly short- and medium-term risks\n\n| RISK RANKING | RISK DESCRIPTION | MITIGATION MEASURES |\n|--------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| Changes in customer attitudes and purchasing patterns | Growing awareness of climate change is expected to impact customer preferences, with an increased preference for products and services with low climate impact from trusted companies that are seen as leaders in sustainability. This could also include reputational risks related to brand perception. | \u2014 Our climate goals are to reduce our absolute GHG emissions by 56% by 2030 (2019 as baseline) and 90% by 2040, when the goal also is to achieve net-zero. These emissions reduction targets have been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). H&M group also aims to become a more circular business which, for example, means sourcing raw materials that are recycled or more sustainably sourced and scaling up customer-facing circular business models. |\n\n\u2014 Our strategies within the sustainability area will allow us to build trust in our brands and provide an offering that has a lower environmental impact than our competitors\u2019 offerings.\n### Transition to lower carbon footprint production and/or low emission technologies\n\n**RISK RANKING:** HIGH  \n**RISK DESCRIPTION:** Fossil fuels remain a significant source of energy in many H&M Group production countries. Climate-related legislation is expected to increase significantly. In response, H&M Group would gradually strengthen requirements for suppliers, as part of the company\u2019s ambition to reduce climate impact. The group provides financial support that assists suppliers in phasing out coal and other fossil fuels. The expected overall result is increased production costs. Investments would also be needed to develop more sustainable materials for use in our garments.\n\n**MITIGATION MEASURES:**  \n- Transparency and clear customer communication about sustainability will help to build trust and increase customer loyalty.  \n- Together with its suppliers, H&M Group is making significant efforts to phase out coal and other fossil fuels in our supply chain. The total spend in 2022 on decarbonization, including e.g. energy efficiency investments in our stores, supporting our suppliers to phase out coal and increasing the share of more sustainable materials, was approximately SEK 2.6 billion.\n\n### Introduction of global or regional carbon taxes\n\n**RISK RANKING:** MEDIUM  \n**RISK DESCRIPTION:** Taxes on GHG emissions or import tolls on garments produced in one region (e.g. Asia) but exported to another (e.g. the European Union) may influence total production costs. This could be both a risk and an opportunity, depending on the ability of H&M Group to phase out fossil fuels in our supply chain.\n\n**MITIGATION MEASURES:**  \n- We have developed an internal tool \u2013 the Climate Roadmap tool \u2013 to help us better understand the most cost-effective paths towards reducing our climate impact.  \n- We will collaborate with peers to amplify support for suppliers to phase out fossil fuels.  \n- We have set targets to reduce GHG emissions throughout our value chain, reducing our vulnerability to possible carbon taxes.  \n- Our sourcing strategy is flexible and we are constantly evaluating the direct and indirect costs of each region to allocate our production in the most efficient way.\n\n### Increased energy and water cost\n\n**RISK RANKING:** MEDIUM  \n**RISK DESCRIPTION:** As the world is moving away from coal to lower carbon energy sources, both renewable and fossil based, the demand for these energy sources will increase. Due to the different grid developments and availability of renewable energy sources in regions in which we have production, there is a risk of regional or local gaps between demand for energy and supply that could lead to increased prices. Similarly, a supply and demand gap or increased taxation on water might also increase prices in the regions where our suppliers are located. Both increases may impact production and operating costs and thus the prices of our products.\n\n**MITIGATION MEASURES:**  \n- We have set targets and have programs in place to increase energy efficiency throughout our value chain, in order to reduce the impact from increasing energy prices. For critical regions and suppliers we are also developing energy transition roadmaps.  \n- We have adopted a new water strategy including targets to reduce water consumption at our suppliers, see page 14.  \n- We are setting up power purchase agreements (PPAs) and other long-term price hedges, as well as direct and indirect investments into renewable energy sources to bolster supply where needed.\n\n### The accelerating temperature increase scenario\n\n**RISK RANKING:** MEDIUM  \n**RISK DESCRIPTION:** H&M Group is heavily dependent on cotton as a raw material. Higher temperatures and water shortages will affect cotton production in many regions. In the long term, the company believes that this will affect the availability and price of cotton. Price increases for other raw materials are also expected.\n\n**MITIGATION MEASURES:**  \n- H&M Group has a strong focus on innovation related to new materials and recycling technologies, with a goal of using at least 30 percent recycled materials by 2025. By increasing the share of recycled materials, our dependence on virgin raw materials is reduced.  \n- Our global sourcing team enables the company to easily change raw material suppliers when necessary to handle short-term price fluctuations.\n### RISK RANKING\n\n| RISK RANKING | RISK DESCRIPTION | MITIGATION MEASURES |\n|--------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| Water scarcity or extreme weather events that influence production and logistics | Climate change will increasingly impact access to freshwater in certain regions, with consequences for where and how garments can be produced. Extreme weather events may also cause disruptions to production and distribution in some countries. | \u2014 We have adopted a new water strategy including targets to reduce water consumption at our suppliers, see page 14.  \n\u2014 For suppliers located in high-risk regions, contingency plans have been developed. These plans prepare the company to temporarily or permanently move production to alternative suppliers located in low-risk regions, if needed. |\n\n### Overview of business opportunities\n\n| OPPORTUNITY | DESCRIPTION | MEASURES TO REALISE THE OPPORTUNITY |\n|-------------|-------------|------------------------------------|\n| Building a more sustainable business and attracting more customers | Increasing awareness of the climate crisis may impact customer preferences for products or services with a low climate impact, from companies that customers trust and that share their values. There is an opportunity for H&M Group to attract more customers by providing a more sustainable and transparent offering. | \u2014 Delivering on H&M Group\u2019s strategy and meeting climate-related customer expectations could lead to a bigger market share.  \n\u2014 Transparency and clear communication about sustainability could increase customer loyalty. |\n| Developing new customer-facing circular business models | Increasing awareness of the climate crisis may change customer behaviour as people are incentivised to switch to new ways of enjoying fashion without the climate impact associated with garment production. This shift will reduce H&M Group\u2019s climate impact and offer the company new revenue streams that complement the traditional business model. | \u2014 H&M Group is continually testing and scaling new business models and new revenue streams, such as resell, garment care and repair services. |\n| Decarbonisation of garment production to reduce the impact of carbon taxes and higher energy prices | Our targets to reduce GHG emissions throughout the value chain could create a competitive advantage versus our competitors, mainly because of reduced impact from future climate legislation and taxes on emissions. | \u2014 Together with its suppliers, H&M Group is making significant efforts to phase out coal and other fossil fuels in our supply chain.  \n\u2014 Our climate strategy, long-term as well as short-term targets, and a willingness to invest in carbon reduction initiatives will enable the decarbonisation of our supply chain.  \n\u2014 We are engaging with policymakers in our production markets, aiming to create the right conditions for the transformation (e.g. by removing subsidies for fossil fuels). |\n| Creation of new business-to-business revenue streams | Increasing awareness of the climate crisis may put pressure on our competitors\u2019 sustainability strategies. This, combined with the decarbonisation of H&M Group\u2019s production, will increase opportunities to expand our current business-to-business service offering. By further investing in reverse supply chain initiatives, H&M Group can introduce potential new revenue streams that complement the traditional business model. | \u2014 H&M Group continually develops new business models and revenue streams, such as collecting, sorting and recycling garments. This includes constantly exploring and investing in external innovations and ideas. |\nImpact on business strategy & financial planning\nClimate-related risks have a major impact on H&M Group\u2019s business strategy. We have set science-based targets approved by the SBTi, aiming to reduce absolute scope 1, 2 & 3 GHG emissions 56% by 2030 and 90% by 2040 (from a 2019 baseline), and also achieve net-zero by 2040 (read more on p. 42).\n\nWe need to reduce our climate impact in line with what science demands. This is something that our customers expect from us, and we expect our strategy could attract more customers and positively impact our sales in the long term.\n\nThis is also a sound business decision, as we expect to see higher energy prices, strengthened climate legislation and increased introduction of climate-related taxes or tolls. Decarbonising our supply chain could therefore offer a competitive advantage to H&M Group. The following are examples of how our business is impacted:\n\n\u2014 Scaling circular business models, such as resell, remake, care and repair solutions enabling customers to extend the use of products (read more on p. 31) can decouple our financial growth from resource use and climate impact.\n\n\u2014 During 2021 H&M Group issued a sustainability-linked bond (with a value of EUR 500 M) enabling financing of sustainability-related initiatives throughout the value chain.\n\n\u2014 Together with its suppliers, H&M Group is making significant efforts to phase out coal and other fossil fuels in our supply chain. The total spend 2022 on decarbonisation, including e.g. energy efficiency investments in our stores, supporting our suppliers to phase out coal and increasing the share of more sustainable materials, was approximately SEK 2.6 billion.\n\n\u2014 Regular review of performance towards targets set by the board of directors and the executive management team, ensuring sufficient resource allocation and progress.\n\n\u2014 Incentive programmes for key executives connected to business goals (including risk) and sustainability performance (including climate).\n\nThe resilience of our strategy\nWe are confident that our climate strategy alongside the measures described above offer a resilient business strategy. We have analysed the possible consequences in the following two scenarios:\n\n\u2014 **The rapid transition scenario (RCP 2.6)**\nH&M Group aims to halve its supply chain GHG emissions by 2030 (in absolute terms, from a 2019 baseline, independent of business growth). This means we will be well prepared for developments such as strengthened climate-related legislation and/or the introduction of carbon taxes. The most significant risk to the company, as well as business opportunity, is lost or increased customer trust that impacts their willingness to enjoy products from H&M Group.\n\n\u2014 **The accelerating temperature increase scenario (RCP 8.5)**\nThe most significant consequence for our business in this scenario is the possible impact on raw material availability and price, especially for cotton. We are limiting the possible business impact of this by reducing our dependency on cotton and other virgin raw materials. In this scenario, our work to create business contingency plans for all parts of our supply chain will help us prevent negative business impacts resulting from extreme weather events. As H&M Group has a limited amount of company-owned assets (production is at external suppliers, warehouses and stores are normally leased), the expected financial impact on company-owned assets related to this scenario is minimal.\n## TCFD disclosures index\n\n| Governance | The organisation\u2019s governance around climate-related risks and opportunities | Page 103

year characterised by negative external factors such as geopolitical challenges and substantial cost inflation, net sales for the full 2021/2022 financial year increased by 12 percent to SEK 223,553 m (198,967). In local currencies, sales increased by 6 percent. The decision to wind down the business in Russia, which was an important and profitable market, had a significant negative impact on the results. A one-time cost of around SEK 1.8 billion has been charged to earnings for the financial year in respect of the wind-down. The hikes in raw materials and freight costs combined with a historically strong US dollar resulted in extensive cost increases for purchases of goods. Gross profit increased to SEK 113,277 m (105,006). This corresponds to a gross margin of 50.7 percent (52.8).\n\nThe gross profit and gross margin are a result of many different factors, internal as well as external, and are mostly affected by the decisions that the H&M group takes in line with its strategy to always have the best customer offering in each individual market \u2013 based on the combination of fashion, quality, price and sustainability.\n\nA cost and efficiency programme was initiated to further streamline the business. From the second half of 2023 onwards this is expected to result in annual savings of around SEK 2 billion. The results were however impacted by a one-time cost of SEK 836 m.\n\nSelling and administrative expenses increased by 18 percent to SEK 106,108 m (89,751). In local currencies, expenses increased by 12 percent.\n\nOperating profit was SEK 7,169 m (15,255), corresponding to an operating margin of 3.2 percent (7.7). Adjusted for the one-time costs of winding down the Russian operations and the cost and efficiency programme, operating profit for the full year was SEK 9,760 m and the operating margin was 4.4 percent.\n\nTAX\n\nThe H&M group\u2019s tax rate for the 2021/2022 financial year was 42.6 percent (23.0). Among other things the final tax rate depends on the results of the group\u2019s various companies, the corporate tax rates in each country, non-deductible costs and tax expense relating to previous years. The relatively high tax rate for the year is due mainly to significantly lower profit after financial items compared with the previous year \u2013 a decrease that is partly attributable to Russia \u2013 in relation to non-deductible costs and tax expense relating to previous years.\n## Group balance sheet\n\n|                        | SEK M 30 NOVEMBER | 2022 | 2021 |\n|------------------------|-------------------|------|------|\n| **ASSETS**             |                   |      |      |\n| **NON-CURRENT ASSETS**|                   |      |      |\n| Intangible non-current assets |               |      |      |\n| Leasehold and similar rights, note 12 | 161 | 224 |\n| Capitalised development expenditure, note 12 | 8,931 | 9,268 |\n| Goodwill, note 12 | 64 | 64 |\n| **Total** | 9,156 | 9,556 |\n| Property, plant and equipment |               |      |      |\n| Buildings and land, note 13 | 697 | 724 |\n| Equipment, tools, fixture and fittings, note 13 | 23,734 | 25,852 |\n| Right-of-use assets, note 15 | 58,305 | 53,086 |\n| **Total** | 82,736 | 79,662 |\n| Non-current financial assets |               |      |      |\n| Interests in associates, note 14 | 503 | 686 |\n| Other shares and interests, note 21 | 2,654 | 4,405 |\n| **Total** | 3,157 | 5,091 |\n| Other non-current assets |               |      |      |\n| Long-term receivables | 939 | 860 |\n| Deferred tax assets, note 11 | 6,537 | 5,626 |\n| **Total** | 7,476 | 6,486 |\n| **TOTAL NON-CURRENT ASSETS** | 102,525 | 100,795 |\n| **CURRENT ASSETS**     |                   |      |      |\n| Stock-in-trade, note 16 | 42,495 | 37,306 |\n| Current receivables |               |      |      |\n| Accounts receivable, note 21 | 3,014 | 3,059 |\n| Tax assets, note 11 | 3,212 | 2,834 |\n| Other receivables | 4,601 | 3,509 |\n| Prepaid expenses, note 17 | 4,494 | 4,807 |\n| **Total** | 15,321 | 14,209 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents, note 18 | 21,707 | 27,471 |\n| **TOTAL CURRENT ASSETS** | 79,523 | 78,986 |\n| **TOTAL ASSETS**       | 182,048 | 179,781 |\n\n|                        | SEK M 30 NOVEMBER | 2022 | 2021 |\n|------------------------|-------------------|------|------|\n| **EQUITY AND LIABILITIES** |                   |      |      |\n| **EQUITY**             |                   |      |      |\n| Share capital, note 19 | 207 | 207 |\n| Reserves | 5,856 | 2,345 |\n| Retained earnings | 44,694 | 57,466 |\n| **Total** | 50,757 | 60,018 |\n| **LIABILITIES**        |                   |      |      |\n| Long-term liabilities |               |      |      |\n| Provisions for pensions, note 20 | 333 | 428 |\n| Other provisions, note 22 | 242 | \u2013 |\n| Deferred tax liabilities, note 11 | 3,273 | 3,601 |\n| Liabilities to credit institutions, note 24 | 9,643 | 9,178 |\n| Other long-term liabilities | 183 | 180 |\n| Other interest-bearing liabilities, note 15, 24 | 49,282 | 45,379 |\n| **Total** | 62,956 | 58,766 |\n| Current liabilities |               |      |      |\n| Accounts payable | 21,090 | 20,382 |\n| Tax liabilities, note 11 | 1,843 | 1,441 |\n| Liabilities to credit institutions, note 24 | 1,135 | 436 |\n| Other provisions, note 22 | 594 | \u2013 |\n| Other long-term liabilities, note 15, 24 | 12,575 | 11,698 |\n| Other liabilities | 6,048 | 5,149 |\n| Accrued expenses and deferred income, note 4, 22 | 25,050 | 21,891 |\n| **Total** | 68,335 | 60,997 |\n| **TOTAL LIABILITIES** | 131,291 | 119,763 |\n| **TOTAL EQUITY AND LIABILITIES** | 182,048 | 179,781 |\nCOMMENTS ON THE GROUP BALANCE SHEET\nThe H&M group is in a strong financial position. The group\u2019s equity/assets ratio was 27.9 percent (33.4). The share of risk-bearing capital was 29.7 percent (35.4). Equity apportioned on the outstanding 1,629,687 (1,655,072) thousand shares as of 30 November 2022 was SEK 31.15 (36.26).\n\nStock-in-trade\nCurrency adjusted the stock-in-trade decreased by 3 percent compared with last year. Converted into SEK the stock-in-trade amounted to SEK 42,495 m (37,306). The book value of stock-in-trade in SEK represented 19.0 percent (18.7) of sales.\n\nFinancing\nAs of 30 November 2022 the group had interest-bearing liabilities, excluding lease liabilities and provisions for pensions, of SEK 10,778 m (9,614) in the form of commercial paper, bonds and loans from credit institutions. In addition, the group has undrawn credit facilities of SEK 17,469 m (15,178). The average maturity of interest-bearing liabilities and undrawn credit facilities was 4.3 (5.6) years. A maturity analysis of outstanding interest-bearing liabilities and undrawn credit facilities is given in the table in note 2.\n\nThe H&M group\u2019s liquidity is very good. As of 30 November 2022, cash and cash equivalents amounted to SEK 21,707 m (27,471). Together, cash and cash equivalents and undrawn credit facilities totalled SEK 39,176 m (42,649).\n\nFinancial net cash amounted to SEK 10,929 m (17,857). Net debt including provisions for pensions and excluding IFRS 16 amounted to SEK -10,596 m (-17,428).\n\nWorking capital from operating activities amounted to SEK 24,419 m (19,983).\n\nThe group aims to secure financial flexibility and freedom of action on the best possible terms.\n\nTo improve the maturity structure of the group\u2019s undrawn revolving credit facilities the following financing activities took place:\n\n\u2014 The EUR 700 m credit facility opened in 2017 that expires in 2023 was closed.\n\n\u2014 Two credit facilities of in total SEK 8,000 m that were opened in 2020 with expiration in 2023 were closed.\n\n\u2014 A five-year sustainability-linked EUR 1,300 m credit facility was opened, with two options to extend for a year at a time.\n\n\u2014 A three-year sustainability-linked EUR 300 m credit facility was opened, with two options to extend for a year at a time.\n\nThe H&M group advocates a conservative leverage ratio, aiming for a strong capital structure with good liquidity and financial flexibility. It is essential that, as in the past, expansion and investments can proceed with continued freedom of action. The capital structure is defined as net debt in relation to EBITDA. It should not exceed 1.0 x EBITDA over time. Net debt/EBITDA excluding IFRS 16 effects was -0.6 (-0.7) as of 30 November 2022.\nGroup changes in equity\n\nAll shareholders\u2019 equity is attributable to the shareholders of the parent company H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB.\n\n| SEK M | SHARE CAPITAL | TRANSLATION DIFFERENCES | HEDGING RESERVES | RETAINED EARNINGS | TOTAL EQUITY |\n|-------|---------------|--------------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------|\n| SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY | | | | | |\n| 1 DECEMBER 2021 | 207 | 2,155 | 190 | 57,466 | 60,018 |\n| Profit for the year | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 3,566 | 3,566 |\n| Other comprehensive income | | | | | |\n| Translation differences | \u2013 | 3,902 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 3,902 |\n| Change in hedging reserves | \u2013 | \u2013 | -478 | \u2013 | -478 |\n| Tax related to hedging reserves | \u2013 | \u2013 | 87 | \u2013 | 87 |\n| Remeasurement of defined benefit pension plans | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 55 | 55 |\n| Tax related to the above remeasurement | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | -9 | -9 |\n| Remeasurement of financial assets | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | -2,697 | -2,697 |\n| Other comprehensive income | \u2013 | 3,902 | -391 | -2,651 | 860 |\n| Comprehensive income | \u2013 | 3,902 | -391 | 915 | 4,426 |\n| Dividend | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | -10,687 | -10,687 |\n| Repurchase of shares | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | -3,000 | -3,000 |\n| SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY | | | | | |\n| 30 NOVEMBER 2022 | 207 | 6,057 | -201 | 44,694 | 50,757 |\n\n| SEK M | SHARE CAPITAL | TRANSLATION DIFFERENCES | HEDGING RESERVES | RETAINED EARNINGS | TOTAL EQUITY |\n|-------|---------------|--------------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------|\n| SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY | | | | | |\n| 1 DECEMBER 2020 | 207 | 725 | 265 | 53,426 | 54,623 |\n| Profit for the year | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 11,010 | 11,010 |\n| Other comprehensive income | | | | | |\n| Translation differences | \u2013 | 1,430 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 1,430 |\n| Change in hedging reserves | \u2013 | \u2013 | -101 | \u2013 | -101 |\n| Tax related to hedging reserves | \u2013 | \u2013 | 26 | \u2013 | 26 |\n| Remeasurement of defined benefit pension plans | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 187 | 187 |\n| Tax related to the above remeasurement | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | -43 | -43 |\n| Remeasurement of financial assets | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 3,644 | 3,644 |\n| Other comprehensive income | \u2013 | 1,430 | -75 | 3,788 | 5,143 |\n| Comprehensive income | \u2013 | 1,430 | -75 | 14,798 | 16,153 |\n| Dividend | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | -10,758 | -10,758 |\n| SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY | | | | | |\n| 30 NOVEMBER 2021 | 207 | 2,155 | 190 | 57,466 | 60,018 |\n## Group cash flow statement\n\n| SEK M | 1 DECEMBER\u201330 NOVEMBER | 2022 | 2021 |\n|-------|------------------------|------|------|\n| **Operating activities** | | | |\n| Profit after financial items | | 6,216 | 14,300 |\n| **Adjustment for non-cash items** | | | |\n| - Provisions for pensions, note 20 | | -68 | -13 |\n| - Other provisions, note 22 | | 836 | - |\n| - Depreciation and amortisation / write-downs, note 9 | | 22,579 | 22,320 |\n| Taxes paid, note 11 | | -3,499 | -4,974 |\n| **Cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital** | | 26,064 | 31,633 |\n| **Changes in working capital** | | | |\n| Operating receivables | | -452 | 736 |\n| Stock-in-trade, note 16 | | -3,734 | 1,263 |\n| Operating liabilities | | 2,598 | 12,459 |\n| **CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES** | | 24,476 | 44,619 |\n| **Investing activities** | | | |\n| Investments in leasehold and similar rights, note 12 | | -27 | -178 |\n| Investments in other intangible assets, note 12 | | -1,457 | -559 |\n| Investments in buildings and land, note 13 | | - | 0 |\n| Investments in equipment, note 13 | | -4,527 | -2,727 |\n| Other investments, note 21 | | -802 | -614 |\n| **CASH FLOW FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES** | | -6,813 | -4,078 |\n| **Financing activities** | | | |\n| Short-term loans | | 680 | -7,671 |\n| New long-term borrowing, note 24 | | - | 5,127 |\n| Repayment of long-term loans, note 24 | | - | -4,604 |\n| Amortisation leases, note 15 | | -12,139 | -12,279 |\n| Dividend | | -10,687 | -10,758 |\n| Repurchase of shares, note 19 | | -3,000 | - |\n| **CASH FLOW FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES, NOTE 24** | | -25,146 | -30,185 |\n| **CASH FLOW FOR THE YEAR** | | -7,483 | 10,357 |\n| **Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of financial year** | | 27,471 | 16,540 |\n| Cash flow for the year | | -7,483 | 10,356 |\n| Exchange rate effect | | 1,719 | 574 |\n| **Cash and cash equivalents at year-end, note 18** | | 21,707 | 27,471 |\n\n1) Interest paid for the group amounts to SEK 243 m (380).

Due to the link between reporting and taxation, year-end appropriations and untaxed reserves are reported in the parent company\u2019s financial statements.\n\nGroup contributions that the parent company receives from subsidiaries and provides to subsidiaries are reported under appropriations.\n\nChanges in accounting principles and disclosure requirements\n\nThe accounting principles and calculation methods applied in this report are unchanged from those used in the preparation of the annual report and consolidated financial statements for 2021 and which are described in note 1, Accounting principles.\n\nFuture accounting principles and disclosure requirements\n\nThe amendments in accounting standard IAS 12 Income Taxes regarding Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction will apply from 1 January 2023, affecting the H&M group\u2019s financial statements from 2024, and will entail that deferred tax will be calculated on right-of-use assets and liabilities attributable to leases.\n\nOther new or amended accounting standards that have been published but not yet entered into force are not expected to have any material impact on the financial statements.\n\nNo new or amended accounting standards that are not yet mandatory have been early adopted by the H&M group.\n\nClimate change\n\nThe potential impact of climate change has been considered in preparing the financial statements, particularly in the context of the risks in the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) climate risk analysis (page 103-107).\n\nThe following areas have been considered:\n\nChanges in customer attitudes and purchasing patterns\n\nClimate-related matters could have an impact on customer behavior and changes in consumption patterns, thus affecting the revenue of the group. The changes in customer attitudes and purchasing patterns could also impact the value of stock, as inventory could become obsolete as a result of a decline in selling prices or demand.\n\nIntroduction of global or regional climate legislation\n\nThe introduction of climate-related legislation, such as carbon taxes, could cause higher production costs, thus affecting the cost of goods sold for the H&M group. Especially suppliers dependent of fossil fuels could be affected by an increase in climate-related legislation.\n\nH&M Group has made efforts to help phase out fossil fuels in the supply chain. These efforts have resulted in increased cost of goods sold as a result of choosing more sustainable materials as well as long-term loans to suppliers, prepaid expenses, selling expenses, and administrative expenses for 2022.\n\nIncrease in raw material, energy, and water costs\n\nClimate-related matters could impact the availability and price of raw materials as well as increase energy and water costs and may impact the production and logistic costs of suppliers causing an increase of the group\u2019s cost of goods sold. Climate change may also cause production and distribution disruptions, also affecting the group\u2019s purchasing costs.\n\nNatural disasters\n\nThe recoverable amount and useful life of assets could be impacted by climate-related matters, such as natural disasters, and could cause costs for impairment and changes in amounts of depreciation.\n\nIn estimating future cash flows, such as for impairment testing purposes, assessments and assumptions are made that are not linked to the scenarios described in the TCFD analysis, as the data that these scenarios are built on are connected with a high degree of uncertainty.\n\nFor 2022, climate change has not been assessed to have a significant impact on the financial statements nor on the estimates and assumptions made when preparing the annual report and consolidated accounts.\n\nGovernment assistance in connection with the Covid-19 situation\n\nIn relation to IAS 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance \u2013 due to the extraordinary situation brought about by the pandemic the H&M group received government assistance in certain markets, mainly in respect of rents and staffing. The H&M group has chosen to report these grants as a reduction in the\ncost of the items to which the grants relate. The grants are reported in the income statement and balance sheet when it is reasonably certain that the grants will be received and any conditions for receiving the grants are fulfilled.\n\n**Estimates, assumptions and assessments**\n\nThe preparation of the annual report and consolidated accounts requires estimates and assumptions to be made, as well as judgments in the application of the accounting principles. These affect carrying amounts for assets, liabilities, income, expenses and supplementary information. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, other relevant factors and expectations of the future, and are reviewed regularly. The actual outcome may therefore deviate from the estimates and assumptions made.\n\nThe sources of estimation uncertainty, assessments and assumptions that have been identified by the H&M group refers to the measurement of stock-in-trade, capitalisation of development expenditures, impairment testing of non-current assets, establishing the term of the lease and an interest rate for borrowing included in the calculations of the right-of-use assets and interest-bearing liabilities attributable to leases, and the measurement of current and deferred tax; see notes 11, 12, 13, 15 and 16.\n\nThe carrying amount of property, plant and equipment including right-of-use assets is tested for impairment when there is an indication of possible impairment. If the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit, for which there is an indication of possible impairment, exceeds the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less cost of disposal and the value in use) the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount of the asset or cash-generating unit. Any impairment is recognised in profit/loss, mainly as selling expenses.\n\nThe general approach is that a grouping of stores, based on a significant degree of revenue substitution including an allocation of online sales, constitute a cash-generating unit and is assessed for impairment testing purposes. The reasons for the change in the approach to determining a cash-generating unit is the increasing omni presence and experience offering to the same customer base and resulting significant revenue substitution between the store and online sales channels as well as within certain groupings of stores. For further information on impairment, see note 13 and 15.\n\nIt is judged that, as of 30 November 2022, there are no estimates or assumptions in the financial statements that involve a significant risk of any material adjustment to the reported values of assets and liabilities in the forthcoming financial year, other than those mentioned above.\n\n**Consolidated accounts**\n\n**Basis of consolidation**\n\nThe consolidated accounts cover the parent company and its subsidiaries and have been prepared according to the acquisition method. The financial reports for the parent company and the subsidiaries included in the consolidated accounts cover the same period and have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles that apply to the group. Intra-group income, expenses, receivables and liabilities, as well as unrealised gains and losses, are eliminated entirely in the preparation of the consolidated accounts. All companies in which the group owns or controls more than 50 percent of the votes, or in which the group alone has a controlling interest through an agreement or otherwise, are consolidated as subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the date of acquisition, which is the date on which the parent company gains a controlling interest and are included in the consolidated accounts until such date as the controlling interest ends.\n\n**Associates**\n\nAll companies in which the group has a significant but not a controlling interest \u2013 generally companies where the group holds 20 to 50 percent of the votes \u2013 are regarded as associates and reported according to the equity method.\n\n**Business combinations**\n\nIn business combinations the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are identified and classified, and these are then measured at fair value on the acquisition date. If the acquisition cost of the subsidiary\u2019s shares exceeds the calculated value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company at the time of acquisition, the difference is reported as goodwill upon consolidation. If the acquisition cost is less than the finally established value of the net identifiable assets, the difference is reported directly in the income statement. Non-controlling interests are determined for each transaction either as a proportionate share of the fair value of net identifiable assets or at fair value. Transaction costs associated with acquisitions are not included in the acquisition cost; instead, these are expensed immediately.\n\n**Translation of foreign subsidiaries**\n\nThe companies making up the group present their financial statements in the currency used in the economic environment in which the company concerned mainly operates, known as the functional currency. These statements form the basis of the consolidated accounts. The consolidated accounts are presented in Swedish kronor, which is the parent company\u2019s functional currency and reporting currency. Assets and liabilities in foreign subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate on the closing date, while the income statement is translated at the average exchange rate for the financial year. The translation difference arising from this, and also as a result of the fact that the net investment is translated at a different exchange rate at the end of the financial year than at the beginning of the financial year, is posted directly to equity as a translation reserve via the statement of comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign business the accumulated translation differences in the income statement are posted together with the profit or loss on disposal.\n\n**Foreign currency**\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the closing date. Exchange rate differences arising on translation are reported in the income statement except for exchange rate differences in respect of loans, which are to be regarded as net investment in a foreign operation. Exchange rate differences of this type are posted to equity as translation differences via the statement of comprehensive income. Exchange rate differences relating to loans in foreign currency taken out to hedge net investments in foreign operations are also recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\n**Interest income**\n\nInterest income is recognised as it is earned.\n\n**Other provisions**\n\nProvisions are reported in the balance sheet when there is an obligation as a result of an event that has occurred, and it is likely that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.\n\nA restructuring provision is recognized when a formal restructuring plan has been prepared and the restructuring has either begun or been announced.\nCash flow statement\nThe cash flow statement is prepared according to the indirect method. The reported cash flow covers only transactions involving payments in or out.\n\n2. FINANCIAL RISKS\n\nThe group\u2019s financing and management of financial risk is carried out centrally within the group\u2019s finance department in accordance with a financial policy established by the board of directors. The financial policy establishes the framework, guidelines, mandate, and responsibilities for monitoring, reporting, and managing financial matters. The group treasurer shall report the group\u2019s liquidity, funding need, and financial risks to the CFO on a monthly basis. The group\u2019s accounting principles for financial instruments, including derivatives, are described in note 21.\n\nIn the course of doing business the group is exposed to risk associated with financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and loans. The group also executes transactions involving currency derivatives for the purpose of managing currency risk that arises in the course of the group\u2019s business.\n\nThe risks relating to these instruments are primarily the following:\n\n\u2014 interest rate risk associated with liabilities to credit institutions, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments;\n\u2014 currency risk associated with flows and with financial assets in foreign currencies;\n\u2014 credit risk and counterparty risk associated with financial assets and derivative positions;\n\u2014 liquidity risk and financing risk relating to liquidity and cash flow as well as financing and refinancing of the group\u2019s capital requirements.\n\nInterest rate risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that earnings or the fair value of assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. The group\u2019s exposure to risk from changes in interest rates relates to cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and liabilities to credit institutions and for finance leases. The original term of the investments is up to three months as of the closing date. The group\u2019s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of the closing date amounted to SEK 21,707 m (27,471). As of the closing date, loans and leases amounted to SEK 72,635 m (66,691). An interest rate increase of 1 percentage point on these amounts would increase interest income from cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments by SEK 222 m (176) and would increase interest expense for external borrowing and finance leases by SEK 544 m (450). A corresponding decrease in the interest rate would reduce interest income by the same amount and would decrease interest expense related to liabilities to credit institutions and for leases.\n\nThe group\u2019s exposure to the reform of interbank offered rates (IBOR) is limited. As of 30 November 2022 there are no drawn credit facilities that refer to IBOR.\n\nCurrency risk\nThere is a risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will have an adverse effect on the company\u2019s financial position, profitability and cash flow. The H&M group is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates via transaction exposure and translation exposure. Transaction exposure arises when sales and purchases are made in currencies other than the company\u2019s reporting currency. Translation exposure arises when subsidiaries\u2019 results, assets, liabilities, and equity are translated into SEK, the group\u2019s reporting currency.\n\nCurrency exposure associated with financial instruments\nThe H&M group\u2019s currency risk associated with financial instruments is mainly related to financial investments, accounts payable and derivatives. The group\u2019s accounts payable in foreign currencies are mainly handled in Sweden and are largely hedged through forward contracts. Based on this, a 10 percent change in the value of the Swedish krona in relation to other currencies would have an insignificant momentary effect on profit related to financial instrument holdings as of the closing date. A 10 percent strengthening of the Swedish krona would have a positive effect on the hedging reserve in equity of around SEK 542 m (849) before taking into account the tax effect, of which SEK 1,207 m (1,590) relates to EUR and SEK -1,892 m (-2,254) to USD. The group\u2019s exposure to outstanding derivative instruments is reported in note 21.\n\nThe group\u2019s operating result for the year was affected by net exchange rate differences relating to flows of goods in the amount of SEK 143 m (-120).\n\nTransaction exposure associated with commercial flows\nPayment flows in the form of payments in foreign currencies for accounts receivable and payable expose the group to currency risk. To manage currency risk relating to changes in exchange rates, the group hedges its currency risk within the framework of the financial policy. Currency risk exposure is managed at a central level. A large share of the group\u2019s sales are made in euros, while the group\u2019s most significant purchase currencies are the US dollar and the euro. Fluctuation in the US dollar/euro exchange rate is the single largest transaction exposure within the group. To hedge the flows of goods in foreign currencies and thereby reduce the effects of future exchange rate fluctuations, the group\u2019s purchases of goods and the bulk of related forecast inflows from the sales companies are fully hedged under forward contracts on an ongoing basis. The average term of outstanding forward contracts is around three months. All derivatives have an original maturity of less than one year.\n\nTranslation exposure on consolidation of entities outside Sweden\nIn addition to the effects of transaction exposure, profits are also affected by translation effects as a result of changes in exchange rates for the local currencies of the various foreign subsidiaries against the Swedish krona, compared to the same period the previous year. The underlying profit/loss in a market may be unchanged in the local currency, but when converted into SEK may increase if the Swedish krona has weakened or decrease if the Swedish krona has strengthened. Translation effects also affect the group\u2019s net assets on consolidation of the foreign subsidiaries\u2019 balance sheets (translation exposure in the balance sheet). Where the remeasurement of balance sheet items affects the group\u2019s income statement, such as in the case of intragroup liabilities and short-term intragroup receivables, these are to be fully hedged. Net investment in foreign currency may be hedged in full or in part through a liability in the same currency, known as an equity hedge. As of 30 November 2022 certain portions of net investments are hedged in this way. The purpose of the hedging is to protect \u2013 in the group\u2019s consolidated accounts \u2013 the majority of the value of net investments in EUR from EUR/SEK exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nCredit risk and counterparty risk\nCredit risk is the risk that the H&M group\u2019s counterparties will be unable to meet their commitments and thus cause losses for the\nCont. Note 2 Financial risks\n\nH&M group. Financial credit risk arises primarily as counterparty risk in the form of investments or cash and cash equivalents in the bank accounts, and also as receivables from banks attributable to surplus value in derivatives. The financial policy states maximum amounts and terms for investments and for cash and cash equivalents in bank accounts with different ratings. Credit exposure as of 30 November 2022 equals the book value for cash and cash equivalents of SEK 21,707 m (27,471), accounts receivable of SEK 3,014 m (3,059) and other SEK 4,777 m (7,373), totalling SEK 29,498 m (37,903). The group\u2019s own credit operations were phased out and are now managed through collaboration with an external party.\n\nThe group aims to have master netting agreements (ISDA) with all counterparties for transactions involving derivative instruments. Assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are not netted in the balance sheet.\n\n| YEAR | COMMERCIAL PAPERS | BONDS (EMTN) | LOANS FROM CREDIT INSTITUTIONS | UNDRAWN CREDIT FACILITIES |\n|------|-------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| 2022 | 350               | \u2013            | \u2013                             | \u2013                        |\n| 2023 | 600               | \u2013            | 2,369                         | \u2013                        |\n| 2024 | \u2013                 | \u2013            | \u2013                             | \u2013                        |\n| 2025 | \u2013                 | \u2013            | \u2013                             | 3,275                    |\n| 2026 | \u2013                 | \u2013            | 2,000                         | \u2013                        |\n| 2027 | \u2013                 | \u2013            | \u2013                             | 14,194                   |\n| 2028 | \u2013                 | \u2013            | \u2013                             | \u2013                        |\n| 2029 | \u2013                 | 5,459        | \u2013                             | \u2013                        |\n\nTotal SEK m 950 5,459 4,369 17,469\n\nSupplier payment process\n\nThe H&M group payment terms to commercial goods suppliers are in line with industry standard. Some suppliers choose to sell their H&M Group receivables, and if requested, the H&M group can introduce banks to purchase these receivables. This arrangement has together with the underlying trade agreements been analysed from a number of indicators of which all fulfill the requirements for these transactions to be recognised as trade payables.\n\n3. SEGMENT REPORTING\n\nThe group\u2019s business consists mainly of sales of clothing, accessories, footwear, cosmetics, home textiles and homeware to consumers. Internal follow-up is carried out on a country-by-country basis by the CEO, who is the group\u2019s chief operating decision maker. Each country is thus an operating segment. The various countries sell similar products via similar sales channels to similar customers, however. Goods purchasing is carried out collectively for the group. Some countries have similar economic characteristics, such as comparable long-term economic results as well as comparable operational and financial risks. In view of this, countries which have these similar economic characteristics are combined in segment reporting in accordance with IFRS 8. The H&M group has combined countries to form the segments Asia & Oceania, Europe & Africa, and North & South America. The parent company and subsidiaries with no external sales are reported separately under Group Functions. The same accounting principles are applied to segment reporting as in the consolidated accounts. Transactions between segments take place on normal commercial terms.\n\n| YEAR | 2022 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|\n| Asia and Oceania | | |\n| External net sales | 29,385 | 26,304 |\n| Operating profit | 689 | 427 |\n| Operating margin, % | 2.3 | 1.6 |\n| Assets excluding tax assets and internal receivables | 13,269 | 11,579 |\n| Liabilities excluding tax liabilities and internal liabilities | 3,354 | 2,789 |\n| Investments | 385 | 280 |\n| Depreciation, amortisation and write-downs | 1,393 | 1,467 |\nCont.

All effects of IFRS 16 are included under Group Functions. Impairment of non-current assets totalling SEK 218 m, as a result of impairment testing, is allocated to segments as follows: Asia and Oceania SEK 48 m, Europe and Africa SEK 92 m, and North and South America SEK 78 m. For further information see note 13.\n\nThe group\u2019s property, plant and equipment amounted to SEK 82,736 m (79,662) as of 30 November 2022. The property, plant and equipment are largely distributed between the countries in accordance with each country\u2019s level of sales. In Sweden property, plant and equipment amounted to SEK 4,101 m (3,969), in the UK to SEK 6,856 m (8,112), in the US to SEK 17,897 m (17,286) and in France to SEK 2,724 m (2,473) as of 30 November 2022.\n\n4. NET SALES\n\nThe group\u2019s income is generated mainly by the sale of clothing, accessories, footwear, cosmetics, home textiles and homeware to consumers. The customers are mainly private individuals, with the same prices applying to all customers. Any price reductions are general and not directed to any specific individual. Sales revenues are reported as net sales in the income statement, i.e. sales revenue less value-added tax, returns and discounts. Revenue from both store and online sales is reported in conjunction with sale to the customer and is based on the country in which the store is located or the online customer lives. In the case of store sales, therefore, the transaction price is due for payment immediately when the customer makes the purchase and receives the product in the store. In the case of online sales this principle means that revenue is reported when control of the goods is considered as transferred from the H&M group.\n\nThe right to return goods is, as a minimum, in accordance with the local rules in the country concerned. Based on historical data and best estimates, a returns reserve and a right of return asset are calculated which are reported gross under Other current liabilities and Stock-in-trade.\n\nThe payment terms are the same for all customers paying in cash or by card and the amount of remuneration is not variable. In certain markets (mainly online) the group collaborates with an external partner to offer payment terms that allow later payment against invoice, usually after 30 days.\n\nGift cards are offered in many countries and generally give rise to a liability in the country concerned with effect from the date of purchase. Revenue is then recognised when the card is used or expires.\n\nFranchise sales have two components: sales of goods to franchisees, which are reported on delivery of the goods, and franchise fees, which are reported when the franchisee sells goods to the consumer.\n\nThe points that members of the H&M loyalty programme can earn and in the future use in the form of discounts represent a right that they would not have without entering into this agreement. Points earned that have not been used are reported as a current liability as well as a reduction in revenue in order to correspond to the future reduction in revenue that arises when the points issued are used to obtain discounts. Revenue is recognised when the points are used or when they expire maximum 12 months after being earned. The group applies the practical expedient not to disclose information about remaining performance obligations since these are thus part of contracts with an\noriginal expected duration of one year or less. The liability is based on fair value calculated per outstanding point.\n\nThe group\u2019s income exhibits seasonal variations. The first quarter of the financial year is normally the weakest and the last quarter the strongest.\n\n| Country   | 2022 | 2021 |\n|-----------|------|------|\n| US        | 33,406 | 27,614 |\n| Germany   | 31,634 | 28,001 |\n| UK        | 16,338 | 13,901 |\n| France    | 10,285 | 9,224 |\n| Sweden    | 8,286  | 8,292 |\n| Italy     | 7,080  | 6,244 |\n| Netherlands | 6,185 | 5,676 |\n| Canada    | 6,172  | 4,932 |\n| Switzerland | 6,146 | 5,345 |\n| Poland    | 5,993  | 5,105 |\n| Other     | 92,028 | 84,633 |\n| Total     | 223,553 | 198,967 |\n\n5. REVENUE FROM GROUP COMPANIES\n\nThe parent company\u2019s internal sales consist of royalties of SEK 3,942 m (3,914) and other income of SEK 37 m (39) from group companies.\n\n6. COSTS BY TYPE\n\nCosts for the group are allocated to three functions: cost of goods sold, selling expenses and administrative expenses.

This means that the fees related to the period until the next AGM was held, i.e. the period 6 May 2021 to 4 May 2022. The amounts were paid out after the 2022 AGM.\n\nAs of the AGM on 4 May 2022 the board consists of eight ordinary members elected by the AGM. There are also three employee representatives, with three deputies for these positions. Eight members of the board are women and six are men. Six of the 14 are employed by the company.\n\nBoard member Lena Patriksson Keller is the majority shareholder in Patriksson Group AB, which had business dealings with H&M during the year. The transactions took place on market terms and remuneration for 2022 amounted to SEK 10.6 m (6.4). Outstanding balances as of 30 November 2022 totalled SEK 0.2 m (0.3). Erica Wiking H\u00e4ger is a partner at the law firm Mannheimer Swartling, which had business dealings with H&M during the year. The transactions took place on market terms and remuneration for 2022 amounted to SEK 3.9 m (1.9). Outstanding balances as of 30 November 2022 totalled SEK 0.1 m (0.1).\n\nRemuneration of senior executives\n\nRemuneration of senior executives is based on guidelines adopted annually by the AGM; see the administration report on pages 80-83.\nRemuneration of the chief executive officer\n\nRemuneration paid to the CEO during the 2022 financial year in the form of salary and benefits amounted to SEK 14.7 m (14.2). There was no variable remuneration in respect of the 2022 financial year, i.e. SEK 0.0 m (7.1). The variable remuneration in respect of the 2021 financial year of SEK 7.1 m was paid and expensed in the first quarter of 2022, as communicated in the 2021 annual report. Pension benefits for the CEO are covered by a defined contribution plan and by the ITP plan. The combined pension expenses shall amount in total to 30 percent of the CEO\u2019s fixed salary. Pension expenses amounted to SEK 4.3 m (4.3). The retirement age for the CEO is 65.\n\nThe CEO is entitled to a 12-month period of notice. In the event that the company cancels the CEO\u2019s employment contract, the CEO will also receive severance pay of a year\u2019s salary. The CEO\u2019s terms of employment are determined by the board of directors.\n\nPension for a former CEO\n\nA former CEO retired on 1 September 2009. The total pension commitments recognised as liabilities, based on the fact that for the first three years of retirement the person received a pension equivalent to 65 percent of fixed salary and thereafter receives a lifelong pension equivalent to 50 percent of the same salary, amount to SEK 97.5 m (125.6). The change in the year\u2019s pension commitments recognised as liabilities includes actuarial gains of SEK 22.0 m (3.2). Pension costs for the former CEO are included under \u201cof which pensions to board, CEO, executive management\u201d.\n\nRemuneration of the executive management team\n\nIn addition to the CEO, as of 30 November 2022 the executive management comprised 14 (14) individuals, five of whom are women. In addition to the CEO, the executive management team consists of the CFO, the person with responsibility for the H&M brand, the person with responsibility for Portfolio Brands, the person with responsibility for Business Ventures, the person with responsibility for Business Tech, the CTO and the heads of the following group functions: Growth, Strategy & Transformation, People & Organisational Development, Sustainability, Supply Chain, Communications, The Laboratory and the Group Strategy Counsel.\n\nRemuneration paid to members of the executive management team, other than the CEO, during the 2022 financial year in the form of salary and benefits amounted to SEK 58.2 m (53.7). There was no variable remuneration in respect of the 2022 financial year, i.e. SEK 0.0 m (14.9). The variable remuneration in respect of the 2021 financial year of SEK 14.9 m was paid and expensed in the first quarter of 2022, as communicated in the 2021 annual report. Pension expenses relating to the executive management team during the year amounted to SEK 23.9 m (17.5). There are rules in place for members of the executive management team with respect to supplements to retirement pension beyond the ITP plan. The retirement age varies between 62 and 65. The cost of this commitment is partially covered by separate insurance policies.\n\nH&M Incentive Program (HIP)\n\nAn extraordinary general meeting held on 20 October 2010 resolved to introduce an incentive programme for all employees of the H&M group.\n\nThe programme was initiated by Stefan Persson and family through the donation of 4,040,404 H&M shares worth around SEK 1 billion to a Swedish foundation, Stiftelsen H&M Incentive Program.\n\nAll employees of the H&M group, regardless of their position and salary level, are included in the programme according to the same basic principle \u2013 based on length of employment, either full-time or part-time. The number of years that the employee has worked for the company previously is taken into account in the qualification period, which is five years unless local rules require otherwise. As a general rule, funds will begin to be paid out no earlier than the age of 62. However, it will also be possible for payments to be made after ten years of employment but no earlier than 2021.\n\nThe 2013 annual general meeting resolved to change the basis of future contributions to HIP. The contribution is no longer linked to the increase in dividend; instead, contributions to HIP are based on 10 percent of the increase in the company\u2019s profit after tax between two consecutive financial years. The increase in profit is calculated on profit after tax before any contribution to HIP. Thus when calculating the contribution to HIP for year 2, the year\u2019s profit after tax is compared with year 1\u2019s profit after tax before any contribution to HIP. This ensures that the two years are compared on a like-for-like basis; in other words, profit after tax before any contribution to HIP. The first contribution to HIP based on an increase in profit was made for the financial year which ended on 30 November 2013.\n\nThe contribution to HIP for a financial year is expensed in the year to which it relates. For example, if profit after tax in year 1 is 100 and profit after tax in year 2 is 130, then the contribution is 3 and will be expensed in year 2.\n\nThere is a ceiling that limits the size of the contribution when the increase in profit between two years may be deemed disproportionately large. The ceiling has been set at 2 percent of profit for the year after tax before any contribution to HIP.\n\nThe contributions to the foundation are to be invested in H&M Group shares. The H&M group has no other commitments beyond this.\n\nIn the consolidated accounts the costs of the incentive programme are recognised in accordance with the rules on short-term profit-sharing and bonus schemes set out in IAS 19. The expense is recognised when the increase in profit between two years may be deemed disproportionately large. The ceiling has been set at 2 percent of profit for the year after tax before any contribution to HIP.\n\nFor 2022 a contribution of SEK 0 m (224) was made to the incentive programme, based on the principle for contributions to HIP adopted at the 2013 AGM and described above.\n\n8.

DEPRECIATION, AMORTISATION AND WRITE-DOWNS\n\nDepreciation and amortisation have been calculated at 12.5 percent of cost for equipment and leasehold rights, and 20 percent for computer equipment and vehicles. Capitalised development expenditure is amortised at 10-20 percent of cost.\n\nBuildings are depreciated at 3 percent of cost. No depreciation is applied to land values. Depreciation and amortisation for the year are reported in the income statement in accordance with the table below.\n\n| GROUP | PARENT COMPANY | 2022 | 2021 | 2022 | 2021 |\n|-------|----------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Cost of goods sold | 1,709 | 1,617 | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| Selling expenses | 19,928 | 19,831 | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| Administrative expenses | 942 | 872 | 20 | 23 |\n| Total | 22,579 | 22,320 | 20 | 23 |\n\n1) Of which write-downs and losses at disposals for the group of 1,494 (925) and 0 (0) for the parent company.\n\nDepreciation relating to right-of-use assets is included above in the amount of SEK 12,105 m (11,988) for the group, which breaks down as follows: cost of goods sold SEK 810 m (881), selling expenses SEK 10,950 m (10,730) and administrative expenses SEK 345 m (377).\n\n### 10.

TAX\n\nIncome taxes in the income statement represent current and deferred tax payable by Swedish and foreign subsidiaries. Current tax is tax that will be paid or received in respect of the current year as well as adjustments to current tax attributable to previous periods. The income tax rate in force in each country is applied.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated according to the balance sheet method based on temporary differences arising between reported and fiscal values of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is calculated using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the receivables or liabilities are settled, based on the tax rates (and the tax legislation) in force on the closing date. A deferred tax liability is recognised for all temporary differences unless it relates to goodwill or to an asset or a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of acquisition, affects neither the reported nor taxable profit or loss for the period. Also, temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and associates are taken into account only to the extent it is likely that the temporary difference will be reversed in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets for temporary differences and loss carryforwards are recognised only to the extent it is likely that these will be able to be utilised.\n\nThe carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are tested as of each closing date and reduced where it is no longer deemed likely that they will be able to be utilised.\n\nGlobal companies such as the H&M group are sometimes involved in tax proceedings of varying extent and at different stages. The H&M group continually evaluates tax proceedings in progress. Where it is likely that additional tax will have to be paid and the outcome can be reasonably estimated, the necessary reserve is made. As of the closing date, tax proceedings relating to internal pricing are in progress in some countries. The H&M group has made an assessment of the likely outcome and reserved the tax expense concerned. As of the closing date, this reserve totalled SEK 183 m (513). This assessment took account of aspects such as whether agreements on double taxation exist and whether there are differences between the tax rates in different countries.\n\n| GROUP | PARENT COMPANY |\n|-------|----------------|\n| 2022  | 2021 | 2022  | 2021 |\n| Other temporary differences | 300 | 43 | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| Effect of changed tax rates | -120 | 106 | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| Subtotal | 708 | 86 | -10 | 6 |\n| Total | -2,650 | -3,290 | -149 | -825 |\n\nDeferred tax recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of:\n\n- Hedging reserves: 87 (26)\n- Defined benefit pension plans: -9 (-4)\n\nTotal: 78 (-17) -4 -1\n\nReconciliation between current tax rate and effective tax rate:\n\n- Expected tax expense according to the Swedish tax rate of 20.6% (21.4%): -1,280 -3,060 -2,003 -2,590\n- Difference in foreign tax rates: -76 19 \u2013 \u2013\n- Non-deductible/non-taxable: -228 -193 -7 -27\n- Other: -22 -81 \u2013 \u2013\n- Tax for previous years: -924 -81 \u2013 0\n- Tax-free dividend subsidiaries: \u2013 \u2013 1,861 1,792\n- Effect of changed tax rates: -120 106 \u2013 \u2013\n\nTotal: -2,650 -3,290 -149 -825\n\nRecognised deferred tax assets relate to:\n\n- Stock-in-trade: 386 363 \u2013 \u2013\n- Loss carryforwards in subsidiaries: 98 73 \u2013 \u2013\n- Pension provisions: 88 112 71 86\n- Intangible non-current assets: 173 182 \u2013 \u2013\n- Property, plant and equipment: 1,450 1,185 \u2013 \u2013\n- Rent-related provisions: 1,866 1,906 \u2013 \u2013\n- Hedging reserves: 121 144 \u2013 \u2013\n- Other temporary differences: 2,355 1,661 \u2013 \u2013\n\nTotal: 6,537 5,626 71 86\n\nRecognised deferred tax liabilities relate to:\n\n- Stock-in-trade: 331 172\n- Pension provisions: 38 \u2013\n- Intangible non-current assets: 982 1,178\n- Property, plant and equipment: 1,355 1,853\n- Rent-related provisions: 26 112\n- Hedging reserves: 168 119\n- Other temporary differences: 373 167\n\nTotal: 3,273 3,601\nAs of the closing date, the group has no loss carryforwards that are not represented by recognised deferred tax assets. The portion of loss carryforwards with a limited utilisation period is not material.\n\n12. INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nIntangible assets with a finite useful life are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment. Amortisation is distributed on a straight-line basis over the assets\u2019 expected useful life.\n\nDevelopment expenditure is capitalised to the extent that it is judged that the company will derive future financial benefits and if the cost can be reliably calculated. The carrying amount includes direct costs for acquired services, costs for payroll and materials as well as indirect costs attributable to the asset. Other development costs, as well as maintenance and training initiatives, are recognised as expenses in the income statement as they arise.\n\nGoodwill is the amount by which the cost of the subsidiary\u2019s shares exceeds the estimated value of the subsidiary\u2019s net identifiable assets upon acquisition. Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is reported as an intangible asset. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are tested for impairment annually or more often if there is an indication of a decline in value. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the recoverable amount (the higher of the net realisable value and the value in use), an impairment loss is applied for the necessary amount. Any impairment is recognised in profit/loss.\n\n### Leasehold and similar rights\n\n|                      | GROUP | 2022 | 2021 |\n|----------------------|-------|------|------|\n| Opening cost         | 1,162 | 1,097|\n| Acquisitions during the year | 10    | 173  |\n| Sales/disposals      | -196  | -128 |\n| Translation effects  | 64    | 20   |\n| Closing cost         | 1,040 | 1,162|\n| Opening amortisation and write-downs | -794  | -789 |\n| Sales/disposals      | 194   | 124  |\n| Amortisation and write-downs for the year | -110  | -117 |\n| Translation effects  | -43   | -12  |\n| Closing accumulated amortisation and write-downs | -753  | -794 |\n| **Closing book value** | **287** | **368** |\n\n### Goodwill\n\n|                      | GROUP | 2022 | 2021 |\n|----------------------|-------|------|------|\n| Opening book value   | 64    | 64   |\n| Change for the year  | \u2013     | \u2013    |\n| **Closing book value** | **64** | **64** |\n\n2) Goodwill arose through the acquisition in 2008 of the company FaBric Scandinavien AB, which is a cash-generating unit. H&M acquired the remaining 40 percent of the shares in FaBric Scandinavien AB at the end of November 2010.\n\nA goodwill impairment test was carried out at the end of 2022. Significant assumptions used when testing goodwill for impairment are sales development and gross margin. The impairment test is based on a calculation of value in use. The value in use has been calculated based on discounted cash flows according to forecasts for the next five years and with an annual growth rate of 2 percent (2) in subsequent years. A discount rate of 11.5 percent (11.5) before tax was used. The cash flows are based on the H&M group\u2019s business plan. The growth rate of 2 percent (2) is based on the H&M group\u2019s assessment of the opportunities and risks associated with the business. The discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital that is estimated to be on a par with the external requirements that the market imposes for similar companies. No impairment was identified and, in the H&M group\u2019s judgment, reasonably possible changes in the variables above would not have such a significant impact that the recoverable amount would be reduced to a lower amount than the carrying amount.\n13. BUILDINGS, LAND AND EQUIPMENT\n\nExpenditure relating to property, plant and equipment are reported in the balance sheet if it is likely that the company will derive future financial benefits associated with the asset and if the asset\u2019s cost can be reliably calculated. Other expenditure as well as expenditure relating to ongoing maintenance and repair are reported as an expense in the period in which they arise. Property, plant and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment. Depreciation is distributed on a straight-line basis over the assets\u2019 expected useful life. No depreciation is applied to land. The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is tested when there is an indication of possible impairment. Impairment of non-current assets as a result of impairment testing due to earnings performance amounted to SEK 86 m for equipment, tools, fixture and fittings and SEK 132 m for right of use assets for 2022, excluding stores where a decision to close was taken prior to year-end, and is recognised mainly as selling expenses.\n\nThe majority of impairment losses recognised in previous years amounting to SEK 115 m was reversed in the period, mainly as selling expenses, as a result of improved earnings performance.\n\nIn addition, a sensitivity analysis has been performed on the result of the impairment indicator test considering a 20 percent reduction in earnings performance.

The majority of the contracts that the H&M group classifies as leases in accordance with IFRS 16 are leases for store premises where the group runs its own operations. Contracts for offices and warehouses used by the group are also classified as leases. In accordance with IFRS 16 a lease liability and a right-of-use asset are calculated for the contracts included. The lease liability is measured initially at the present value of the future lease payments discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, and in subsequent periods by increasing the liability to reflect the effect of interest and reducing it to reflect the effect of lease payments made. The right-of-use asset is measured initially at the value of the lease liability and in subsequent periods at cost less depreciation and impairment. Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the estimated lease term. In accordance with the standard, the lease liability is calculated based on fixed lease payments. Variable lease payments, such as sales-based rent, are not included in the lease liability. Property tax is a variable expense and is therefore also excluded from the lease liability. The group has decided to apply the option to exclude leases of low value and leases with a term of less than 12 months. These will therefore not be included in the lease liability but instead will continue to be reported as rental costs, expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The company has no sale and leaseback transactions. Some leases contain clauses concerning restoration of the premises; the effect of this is not material for the group.\n\nThe H&M group has around 4,500 stores as well as multiple offices and warehouses all around the world. Applying the standard has required estimates and assumptions, such as establishing the term of the lease and an interest rate for borrowing. The assumption that has the greatest effect on the size of the lease liability is the assessment of the lease term. Break and extension options are exercised on the expiry of the lease term, the lease may be terminated entirely, renegotiated or extended depending on the provisions in the contract. In certain circumstances, a right to terminate the contract during the lease term may reduce the lease term used for the calculation. The option to extend is considered if it is reasonably certain that the lessee will exercise this option. It is rare for a lease to be terminated before the lease term has expired. To facilitate assessment of the lease term used to calculate the lease obligation according to IFRS 16, the assumptions are based on the type of contract. The assumptions used to establish the lease term for each type of contract are based on the best possible assessment and on historical data, as well as the current market situation. Leasing period for stores is based on the store class and location. Flagship stores in strategical locations have a leasing period set to the contract\u2019s end date regardless of break rights. For all other stores classes H&M Group uses the first break right regardless contract length. Other stores that are not flagship, have an average leasing period of ca 3.5 years. Leasing period for warehouses and offices is calculated based on the contract length. The group\u2019s assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis considering changes in the industry. The discount rate used for the calculation corresponds to the H&M group\u2019s incremental borrowing rate, considering aspects such as currency and length of the respective leases. The rate is updated annually and monitored continuously to update during the financial year if needed. Marginal discount rate reflects H&M Group\u2019s credit risk.\n\nThe group is reporting a cash outflow for leases of SEK 12,139 m (12,279) for the 2022 financial year.\n\nFor further information on impairment, see note 1 and 13.\n\nCovid-19\n\nThe H&M group has chosen not to apply the amendment to IFRS 16 that allows relief for rent concessions attributable to Covid-19.\n\nThe amounts attributable to leasing activities that were recognised in the income statement during the year are presented below:\n\n| GROUP | 2022 | 2021 |\n|-------|------|------|\n| Depreciation of right-of-use assets | 11,838 | 12,044 |\n| Write-down of right-of-use assets | 307 | \u2013 |\n| Interest expense for lease liabilities | 872 | 779 |\n| Expense for variable lease payments | 6,938 | 5,605 |\n| Other miscellaneous lease related charges | 3,273 | 2,078 |\n| **Total expense attributable to leasing activities** | **23,228** | **20,507** |\n\nRight-of-use assets and lease liability under IFRS 16\n\nThe group divides its leases into three classes of right-of-use asset: Stores, Warehouses and Offices.

STOCK-IN-TRADE\n\nThe stock-in-trade, which consists of merchandise, is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost refers to the company\u2019s expenses for acquiring the goods including customs duties and shipping. The net realisable value is the estimated market value less calculated selling expenses. From the moment the goods are transferred from the supplier to the transport service provider appointed by the H&M group, the goods are owned according to civil law by the H&M group and become part of H&M Group\u2019s reported stock-in-trade. Goods that have not yet arrived at a store are valued at their actual purchase cost including the estimated cost of customs duties and shipping.\n\nFor the majority of the group\u2019s goods, cost is calculated as weighted average prices; for other stock accounting, the carrying amount is calculated as the selling price less the estimated gross margin (the retail method). The group is continuing to gradually move across to calculating cost as weighted average prices, but this change has no material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nStock-in-trade amounted to SEK 42,495 m (37,306), a 13.9 percent increase in SEK compared with the same point in time last year. In local currencies there was a 3 percent decrease.\n\nSignificant write-downs are rare. There were no material write-downs in the current financial year or the previous financial year. Only an insignificant part of the stock-in-trade is valued at net realisable value. The group\u2019s asset for rights of return does not increase stock-in-trade by a material amount. There is deemed to be no material obsolescence in the stock-in-trade.\n\nThe stock-in-trade amounted to 23.3 percent (20.8) of total assets and 19.0 percent (18.7) of net sales.\n\n17. PREPAID EXPENSES\n\n| GROUP | PARENT COMPANY |\n|-------|----------------|\n| 2022 | 2021 | 2022 | 2021 |\n| Prepaid rent | 2,890 | 2,884 | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| Other items | 1,604 | 1,923 | 186 | 90 |\n| Total | 4,494 | 4,807 | 186 | 90 |\n\n18. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and bank balances as well as short-term investments with a maximum term of three months from the date of acquisition. These investments carry no significant risk of changes in value. The loss allowance for expected credit losses as of the closing day does not amount to a significant amount and has therefore not been recognised.\n\nInvestments are made on market terms and the interest rates are between 0 and 18.75 percent. The difference in interest rate depends mainly on the currency in which the funds are invested.\n\n19. SHARE CAPITAL\n\nThe share capital is divided between 194,400,000 class A shares (10 votes per share) and 1,460,672,000 class B shares (one vote per share). There are no other differences between the rights associated with the shares. The total number of shares is 1,655,072,000.\n\nA share buyback programme was initiated on 29 June 2022. During the period 29 June \u2013 28 November 2022 a total of 25,385,163 own B shares were repurchased for SEK 3 billion. As at 30 November the total number of outstanding shares, excluding own shares, was 1,629,686,837. In the 2022 financial year a dividend of SEK 10,688 m was distributed.\n\nThe group\u2019s managed capital consists of shareholders\u2019 equity. The group\u2019s goal with respect to managing the capital is to enable good growth to continue and to be prepared to exploit business opportunities. The board of directors\u2019 intention is to continue to provide shareholders with a good direct return while ensuring that, as in the past, expansion and investments in the business can proceed with a continued strong financial position and freedom of action. Based on this, the board of directors has proposed a dividend policy stating that the ordinary dividend over time is to exceed 50 percent of profit after tax and additionally that identified surplus liquidity \u2013 taking into consideration the capital structure target and investment requirements \u2013 can be distributed to shareholders through an extra dividend or a buyback programme.\n20. PROVISIONS FOR PENSIONS\n\nThe H&M group has several different plans for benefits after employment has ended. The plans are either defined benefit or defined contribution plans. Defined contribution plans are reported as an expense in the period when the employee performs the service to which the benefit relates. Defined benefit plans are assessed separately for each plan based on the benefits earned during the previous and current periods. The defined benefit obligations less the fair value of any managed assets are reported under the heading Provisions for pensions. In the case of the Swedish entities, the actuarial calculations also cover future payments of special payroll tax. Defined benefit plans are found in Germany, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Pension obligations are assessed annually with the help of independent actuaries according to the Projected Unit Credit Method. The assessment is made using actuarial assumptions. These assumptions include such things as the discount rate, mortality and anticipated salary and pension increases. Changes in the actuarial assumptions and outcomes that deviate from the assumptions give rise to actuarial gains or losses. The actuarial gains and losses arising are mainly due to the financial assumptions, such as changes in the discount rate. Such gains or losses are recognised in other comprehensive income in the year they arise.\n\nFor salaried employees in Sweden, the H&M group applies the ITP plan through insurance policies with Alecta and Collectum, i.e. ITP 2 and ITP 1. According to statement UFR 10 from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board, the ITP 2 plan is a defined benefit plan that covers a number of employers. The plan will be reported as a defined contribution plan until the company gains access to information that allows this plan to be reported according to the rules for defined benefit plans. The expected contributions to ITP 2 for the next annual reporting period is estimated at SEK 202 m. The ITP 1 plan is a defined contribution plan. See also note 7 for information on pension to a former CEO.\n\nAlecta\u2019s surplus cannot be allocated to the insured employer and/or the insured employees. As of 30 September 2022, Alecta\u2019s consolidation ratio was 189 percent (169). The consolidation ratio is calculated as the fair value of managed assets as a percentage of the obligations calculated in accordance with Alecta\u2019s actuarial assumptions. This calculation is not in line with IAS 19.\n\n| GROUP | PARENT COMPANY |\n|-------|----------------|\n| 2022  | 2021          | 2022  | 2021 |\n| Present value of defined benefit obligations | 1,736 | 1,794 | 119  | 154 |\n| Fair value of managed assets | -1,403 | -1,366 | -3   | -10 |\n| Provisions for pension obligations recognised in the balance sheet | 333  | 428  | 116  | 144 |\n| Opening balance 1 December | 1,794 | 1,819 | 154  | 180 |\n| Recognised pension expenses, net | 4    | 33   | -19  | -6  |\n| Pensions paid out | -18  | 26   | -10  | 20  |\n| Contributions by plan participants | 31   | 32   | \u2013    | \u2013   |\n| Disbursements from assets | -75  | -64  | -6   | \u2013   |\n| Carrying amount of defined benefit obligations, 30 November | 1,736 | 1,794 | 119  | 154 |\n| Opening balance 1 December | -1,366 | -1,207 | -10  | -11 |\n| Recognised pension income, net | -37  | -145 | 1    | 1   |\n| Premiums paid by employer | -44  | -46  | \u2013    | \u2013   |\n| Contributions by plan participants | -31  | -32  | \u2013    | \u2013   |\n| Disbursements | 75   | 64   | 6    | \u2013   |\n| Carrying amount of fair value of plan assets, 30 November | -1,403 | -1,366 | -3   | -10 |\n\nOf the total recognised obligation, SEK 131 m (168) relates to defined benefit pensions plans in Sweden and SEK 163 m (202) to plans in Switzerland. The weighted average maturity of these pension plans is 7.7 years for the Swedish plans and 12.9 years for the Swiss plans.\nCont.

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BY CATEGORY\n\nThe group applies IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.\n\nFinancial instruments recognised in the balance sheet include on the assets side cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term investments, non-current receivables, and derivatives. On the liabilities side are accounts payable, liabilities to credit institutions and derivatives. Financial instruments are reported in the balance sheet when the group becomes party to the contractual terms of the instrument. Financial assets are removed from the balance sheet when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset cease. Financial liabilities are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation is met, cancelled, or ends. For lease liabilities see note 15.\n\nFinancial instruments are measured based on inputs classified in accordance with IFRS 13:\n\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, such as shares or bonds listed on a stock exchange.\n\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (such as quoted prices) or indirectly (obtained from quoted prices), such as currency forwards or interest rate swaps.\n\nLevel 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not entirely based on observable market data.\n\nClassification and subsequent recognition\n\nAt the date of acquisition the financial instruments are classified in the categories below.\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nIn view of the strategic nature of the interests, assets in this category consists of non-controlling interests that are revalued in other comprehensive income as well as in financial assets in the balance sheet. The valuation of the holding in Renewcell AB is based on the share price on the closing day (level 1), and the fair value of the investment amounts to SEK 242 m (782) as of 30 November 2022.\n\nThe valuation of the other non-controlling interests is based primarily on the latest financing round or transaction. When this is not available, the companies are valued by applying an appropriate valuation technique for each specific holding. In these cases, the following valuation techniques may be taken into consideration: applying relevant multiples from similar companies to the holding\u2019s key ratios, historical transactions in the industry, and the discounted cash flow method. The fair value of the remaining shares and interests is based on the latest financing round or transaction. The price from the latest financing round or transaction is assessed to represent fair value of investments as transactions have been made between independent parties and no significant events affecting the fair value has occurred between the date of the prior transaction and the closing day. If the price in the latest financing round or transaction had been 1 percent higher, the value of the holding would have increased to the same extent. The fair value of the remaining shares and interests amounts to SEK 2,412 m (3,623) as of 30 November 2022, the largest investments being Instabee SEK 709 m (377), Sheertex SEK 526 m (31), and Klarna SEK 456 m (2,939). The fair value of the majority of the investments is based on financing rounds or transactions made during the current financial year.\n\nReconciliation of investments based on level 3 input\n\n| 2022 | 2021 |\n|------|------|\n| Opening balance | 3,623 | 427 |\n| Additions | 816 | 578 |\n| Disposals | -25 | -19 |\n| Reclassification\u00b9 | 28 | -337 |\n| Gain or loss recognised in Other comprehensive income\u00b2 | -2,030 | 2,974 |\n| **Closing balance** | **2,412** | **3,623** |\n\n\u00b9 Reclassification refers to investments in CALA and Thread Inc being reclassified as investments in associates for 2021 and investment in Worn Again being reclassified to non-controlling interest in 2022.\n\n\u00b2 The effect on Other comprehensive income for 2022 consists primarily of the loss recognised on the Klarna investment of SEK -2,482 m. The valuation is based on an indicative subscription price from a transaction in July 2022.\n\nFinancial assets measured at amortised cost\n\nAssets in this category are measured at amortised cost, with the effective interest rate being used to calculate the value. These assets are held under the business model for collection of contractual cash...\nflows that represent solely payments of principal and interest. The carrying amount of assets measured at amortised cost is adjusted by any expected credit loss allowance recognised. This category primarily covers cash and bank balances as well as accounts receivable. The group\u2019s own credit operations were phased out and are now managed through collaboration with an external party. As of the closing date, all of the group\u2019s short-term investments fell into this category.\n\nRecognition of expected credit losses\nThe group will recognise a loss allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortised cost. As of the closing day, an adjustment of the loss allowance will be recognised in profit or loss.\n\nThe group will measure the loss allowance at an amount equal to 12 months expected credit losses. If the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since the initial recognition, the loss allowance will be measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. Cash and cash equivalents are assessed to have a low credit risk. For accounts receivables, the group will apply the simplified approach which means that the loss allowance will be measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. The loss allowance for expected credit losses as of the closing day does not amount to a significant amount and has therefore not been recognised.\n\nFinancial liabilities measured at amortised cost\nThis category includes financial liabilities that are not held for trading. These are initially recognised at fair value, net after transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, which means that the estimated change in value (the effective interest) is recognised as interest income or interest expense in the income statement. Accounts payable fall into this category. These have a short expected term and are recognised at the nominal amount with no discounting. Liabilities to credit institutions are measured at amortised cost. All of the liabilities stated below under financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost. A calculation at fair value would reduce the group\u2019s liabilities to credit institutions by approximately SEK 1,300 m. The reduction is due to general increase in interest rates since liabilities were issued.\n\nDerivatives with hedge accounting\nCurrency derivatives are measured at fair value based on Level 2 inputs in the IFRS 13 hierarchy. As of 30 November 2022, forward contracts with a positive market value amount to SEK 681 m (1,422), which is reported under other current receivables. Forward contracts with a negative market value amount to SEK 1,365 m (1,015), which is reported under other current liabilities. Other financial assets and liabilities have short terms. The fair values of these financial instruments are assessed to be approximately equal to their book values.\n\nReporting of derivatives used for hedging purposes\nAll derivatives are reported initially and subsequently at fair value in the balance sheet.\n\nThe group\u2019s policy is for derivatives to be held for hedging purposes only. Derivatives comprise forward currency contracts used to hedge the risk of exchange rate fluctuations for internal and external flows of goods.\n\nTo meet the requirements of hedge accounting there must be a clear link to the hedged item. In addition, the hedge must effectively protect the hedged item, hedge documentation must have been prepared and the effectiveness must be measurable.\n\nIn hedge accounting, derivatives are classified as cash flow hedging or as fair value hedging. In the past financial year all were categorised as cash flow hedging or hedging of net investments in foreign operations.\n\nHedging of forecast currency flows \u2013 cash flow hedging\nDerivatives that hedge the forecast flow are reported in the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in value are reported in equity as a hedging reserve, through other comprehensive income, until such time as the hedged flow is recognised in operating profit, at which time the hedging instrument\u2019s accumulated changes in value are transferred to the income statement where they then correspond to the profit/loss effects of the hedged transaction. The effectiveness of cash flow hedges for hedging currency flows is measured monthly by comparing the hedged item with the hedging instrument.\n\nMeasurement of the category hedging derivatives at fair value is based on observable data; in other words, in accordance with Level 2 in the measurement hierarchy established in IFRS 13. The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by discounting the difference between the agreed forward rate and the forward rate that can be obtained on the closing date for the remaining contract term. Contracts are discounted to a risk-free rate based on government bonds.\n\nHedging of net investments in foreign operations\nDerivatives intended for hedging net investments in foreign operations are recognised in equity through other comprehensive income. The effectiveness of hedging of net investments in foreign operations is measured quarterly by comparing the hedged item with the hedging instrument.\n\nThe fair value of all financial assets and liabilities essentially corresponds to the book value. Assets and liabilities that are recognised at amortised cost have short remaining terms, making the difference between book value and fair value negligible.\n\nThe following table shows the outstanding forward contracts for cash flow hedging reported in the hedging reserve as of the closing date.\nCont.

The administration report for the group and the parent company provides a true and fair view of the development of the group\u2019s and the parent company\u2019s business, position and earnings, and describes the significant risks and uncertainties faced by the parent company and the companies making up the group.\n\nStockholm, 23 March 2023\n\nKarl-Johan Persson\nChair of the Board\n\nStina Bergfors\nBoard member\n\nAnders Dahlvig\nBoard member\n\nLena Patriksson Keller\nBoard member\n\nChristian Sievert\nBoard member\n\nErica Wiking H\u00e4ger\nBoard member\n\nNiklas Zennstr\u00f6m\nBoard member\n\nDanica Kragic Jensfelt\nBoard member\n\nIngrid Godin\nBoard member\n\nLouise Wikholm\nBoard member\n\nTim Gahnstr\u00f6m\nBoard member\n\nHelena Helmersson\nChief Executive Officer\n\nOur audit report was submitted on 23 March 2023\n\nDeloitte AB\n\nDidrik Roos Authorised Public Accountant\nAuditor\u2019s report\n\nTo the general meeting of the shareholders of H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB [publ] [publ]\ncorporate identity number 556042-7220\n\nReport on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts\n\nOpinions\nWe have audited the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB [publ] for the financial year 2021-12-01 - 2022-11-30, except for the sustainability report on pages 86-107. The annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included on pages 73-141 in this document.\n\nIn our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the parent company as of 30 November 2022 and its financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group as of 30 November 2022 and their financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act. Our opinions do not cover the statutory sustainability report on pages 86-107. The statutory administration report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts.\n\nWe therefore recommend that the general meeting of shareholders adopts the income statement and balance sheet for the parent company and the group.\n\nOur opinions in this report on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts are consistent with the content of the additional report that has been submitted to the parent company\u2019s audit committee in accordance with the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 11.\n\nBasis for Opinions\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor\u2019s Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. This includes that, based on the best of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited services referred to in the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 5.1 have been provided to the audited company or, where applicable, its parent company or its controlled companies within the EU.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.\n\nKey Audit Matters\nKey audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of, and in forming our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nImpairment of store assets\nAs of November 30, 2022, the Group held SEK 82 736 million of property, plant and equipment consisting mainly of equipment, tools, fixture and fittings (SEK 23 734 million) and right of use assets (SEK 58 305 million). In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, management is required to complete an annual assessment of indicators of impairment of its store portfolio. Impairment charges of equipment, tools, fixture and fittings and right of use assets have been recognized amounting to SEK 86 million and SEK 132 million, excluding stores where a decision to close was taken prior to year-end.\n\nThe Group considers that generally a grouping of stores based on a significant degree of revenue substitution including allocation of online sales constitute a cash generating unit and is assessed for impairment separately. The determination of the cash generating unit requires management judgement and a high degree of estimation.\n\nWhen an impairment test has been conducted, management has estimated the recoverable amount of store assets based on their value in use derived from a discounted cash flow model. This requires management\u2019s judgement and a number of key assumptions, such as future revenue growth, changes in gross margin, long-term growth rates and applied discount rates.\n\nA change in management\u2019s judgements and estimates may have a material effect on the financial statements and consequently impairment of store assets is considered a key audit matter.\n\nAccounting principles and disclosures related to accounting for impairment of store assets can be found in note 1 (Accounting principles), note 13 (Buildings, land and equipment) and note 15 (Leases).\n\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited to:\n\n\u2014 Assessing the accounting principles for impairment of store assets in compliance with IFRS, with the support of accounting specialists,\n\n\u2014 Obtaining an understanding of the store impairment process as well as the forecasting process,\n\n\u2014 Evaluating and challenging management\u2019s range of impairment indicators,\n\n\u2014 Evaluating and challenging management\u2019s identification of cash generating units and the supporting documentation,\n\n\u2014 Evaluating and challenging key assumptions such as future revenue growth, changes in gross margin, long-term growth rates and applied discount rates,\n\n\u2014 Reviewing the accuracy of past forecasts of growth rates and future cash flows to assess the level of accuracy of the forecasting process,\n\n\u2014 Assessing the appropriateness of the discount rates applied with the involvement of our internal valuations specialists,\n\n\u2014 Assessing the mechanical accuracy of the impairment models and the methodology applied by management for consistency with the requirements of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, and\n\n\u2014 Evaluating the appropriateness of disclosures made in the financial statements.\n\nAccounting for leases\nThe Group has a large number of lease contracts including approximately 4,500 stores as well as multiple offices and warehouses globally. The right of use asset amounts to SEK 58 305 million as of November 30, 2022 and constitutes 32% of the Group\u2019s total assets.\nIFRS 16 Leases is complex and requires a high level of management\u2019s judgements and estimates, such as determining the term of the lease contracts and the interest rate of borrowing. Management is working actively with the store portfolio meaning contracts are changed, terminated, and renewed continuously. Accounting for leases requires a well-functioning process and a clear policy. Changes in judgements and assumptions made by management may have a material effect on the financial statements and consequently accounting for leases is considered a key audit matter.\n\nAccounting principles and disclosures related to accounting for leases can be found in note 1 (Accounting principles) and note 15 (Leases).\n\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited to:\n\n\u2014 Assessing the group\u2019s accounting principles for leases in compliance with IFRS with the support of accounting specialists,\n\n\u2014 Obtaining an understanding of the internal control environment regarding leases and test identified key controls for design and implementation including related IT systems,\n\n\u2014 Evaluating management\u2019s assessment of lease terms including renewals and extensions,\n\n\u2014 Evaluating the methodology related to determining the incremental borrowing rate and on a sample basis testing the rate applied,\n\n\u2014 Assessing the right of use asset for impairment,\n\n\u2014 Testing the accuracy of the underlying lease data by agreeing a representative sample of leases to original contract or other supporting information,\n\n\u2014 Testing the mechanical accuracy of the lease calculations, and\n\n\u2014 Evaluating the appropriateness of disclosures made in the financial statements.\n\nValuation of stock-in-trade\nThe Group carries a material level of stock-in-trade held by central warehouses and stores, spread over a large number of countries globally. As of November 30, 2022, stock-in-trade amounts to SEK 42,495 million corresponding to 23% of the Group\u2019s total assets. Stock-in-trade is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Valuation of stock-in-trade requires clear policies and is subject to management\u2019s judgements and estimates, such as calculating the cost of custom duties and freight and estimating a provision for obsolescence and sales returns. The current macroeconomic environment has increased the uncertainty and customer behaviour is rapidly changing within the retail industry, impacting the need to continuously revisit and evaluate the method in use. Changes in judgements and assumptions made by management may have a material effect on the financial statements and consequently valuation of stock-in-trade is considered a key audit matter.\n\nAccounting principles and disclosures related to stock-in-trade can be found in note 1 (Accounting principles) and note 16 (Stock-in-trade).\n\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited to:\n\n\u2014 Assessing the group\u2019s accounting principles for inventory in compliance with IFRS with the support of accounting specialists,\n\n\u2014 Obtaining an understanding of the internal control environment regarding valuation of inventory and test identified key controls for design and implementation including related IT systems,\n\n\u2014 Observing a sample of physical inventory counts in stores and warehouses,\n\n\u2014 On a sample basis testing valuation of inventory,\n\n\u2014 Evaluating management\u2019s estimates related to provisions for obsolescence and sales return, and\n\n\u2014 Evaluating the appropriateness of disclosures made in the financial statements.\n\nOther information than the annual accounts and consolidated accounts\nThe other information consists of the remuneration report and the pages 2-54, 86-107 and 147-152. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the other information.\n\nOur opinion on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts does not cover this other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion regarding this other information.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, our responsibility is to read the information identified above and consider whether the information is materially inconsistent with the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. In this procedure we also take into account our knowledge otherwise obtained in the audit and assess whether the information otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf we, based on the work performed concerning this information, conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\nResponsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and, concerning the consolidated accounts, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of annual accounts and consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the assessment of the company\u2019s and the group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. They disclose, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is however not applied if the Board of Directors and the Managing Director intends to liquidate the company, to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit Committee shall, without prejudice to the Board of Director\u2019s responsibilities and tasks in general, among other things oversee the company\u2019s financial reporting process.\n\nAuditor\u2019s responsibility\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an\nWe have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding\nWe must also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that\nWe must inform the Board of Directors of, among other matters,\nWe also:\n\u2014 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the annual\naccounts and consolidated accounts, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those\nrisks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to\nprovide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material\nmisstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional\nomissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\u2014 Obtain an understanding of the company\u2019s internal control relevant\nto our audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an\nopinion on the effectiveness of the company\u2019s internal control.\n\u2014 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the\nreasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures\nmade by the Board of Directors and the Managing Director.\n\u2014 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors\u2019 and the\nManaging Director\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting\nin preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. We\nalso draw a conclusion, based on the audit evidence obtained, as\nto whether any material uncertainty exists related to events or\nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the company\u2019s and the\ngroup\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that\na material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in\nour auditor\u2019s report to the related disclosures in the annual accounts\nand consolidated accounts or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to\nmodify our opinion about the annual accounts and consolidated\naccounts. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence\nobtained up to the date of our auditor\u2019s report. However, future\nevents or conditions may cause a company and a group to cease to\ncontinue as a going concern.\n\u2014 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of\nthe annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including the\ndisclosures, and whether the annual accounts and consolidated\naccounts represent the underlying transactions and events in a\nmanner that achieves fair presentation.\n\u2014 Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the\nfinancial information of the entities or business activities within the\ngroup to express an opinion on the consolidated accounts. We are\nresponsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the\ngroup audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions.\n\nWe must inform the Board of Directors of, among other matters,\nthe planned scope and timing of the audit. We must also inform of\nsignificant audit findings during our audit, including any significant\ndeficiencies in internal control that we identified.\n\nWe must also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that\nwe have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding\nindependence, and to communicate with them all relationships\nand other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our\nindependence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate\nthreats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we\ndetermine those matters that were of most significance in the audit\nof the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including the most\nimportant assessed risks for material misstatement, and are therefore\nthe key audit matters. We describe these matters in the auditor\u2019s\nreport unless law or regulation precludes disclosure about the matter.\n\nReport on other legal and regulatory requirements\nOpinions\nIn addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated\naccounts, we have also audited the administration of the Board of\nDirectors and the Managing Director of H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB\n(publ) for the financial year 2021-12-01 - 2022-11-30 and the proposed\nappropriations of the company\u2019s profit or loss.\n\nWe recommend to the general meeting of shareholders that the profit\nto be appropriated in accordance with the proposal in the statutory\nadministration report and that the members of the Board of Directors\nand the Managing Director be discharged from liability for the financial\nyear.\n\nBasis for Opinions\nWe conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted\nauditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those\nstandards are further described in the Auditor\u2019s Responsibilities\nsection. We are independent of the parent company and the group in\naccordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and\nhave otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with\nthese requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and\nappropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.\n\nResponsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for\nappropriations of the company\u2019s profit or loss. At the proposal of\na dividend, this includes an assessment of whether the dividend is\njustifiable considering the requirements which the company\u2019s and\nthe group\u2019s type of operations, size and risks place on the size of the\nparent company\u2019s and the group\u2019s equity, consolidation requirements,\nliquidity and position in general.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the company\u2019s organization\nand the administration of the company\u2019s affairs. This includes\namong other things continuous assessment of the company\u2019s and\nthe group\u2019s financial situation and ensuring that the company\u2019s\norganization is designed so that the accounting, management of\nassets and the company\u2019s financial affairs otherwise are controlled\nin a reassuring manner. The Managing Director shall manage the\nongoing administration according to the Board of Directors\u2019 guidelines\nand instructions and among other matters take measures that are\nnecessary to fulfill the company\u2019s accounting in accordance with law\nand handle the management of assets in a reassuring manner.\n\nAuditor\u2019s responsibility\nOur objective concerning the audit of the administration, and thereby\nour opinion about discharge from liability, is to obtain audit evidence\nto assess with a reasonable degree of assurance whether any member\nof the Board of Directors or the Managing Director in any material\nrespect:\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nOur objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropriations of the company\u2019s profit or loss, and thereby our opinion about this, is to assess with reasonable degree of assurance whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect actions or omissions that can give rise to liability to the company, or that the proposed appropriations of the company\u2019s profit or loss are not in accordance with the Companies Act.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. The examination of the administration and the proposed appropriations of the company\u2019s profit or loss is based primarily on the audit of the accounts. Additional audit procedures performed are based on our professional judgment with starting point in risk and materiality. This means that we focus the examination on such actions, areas and relationships that are material for the operations and where deviations and violations would have particular importance for the company\u2019s situation. We examine and test decisions undertaken, support for decisions, actions taken and other circumstances that are relevant to our opinion concerning discharge from liability. As a basis for our opinion on the Board of Directors\u2019 proposed appropriations of the company\u2019s profit or loss we examined the Board of Directors\u2019 reasoned statement and a selection of supporting evidence in order to be able to assess whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.\n\nThe auditor\u2019s examination of the Esef report\n\nOpinion\n\nIn addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, we have also examined that the Board of Directors and the Managing Director have prepared the annual accounts and consolidated accounts in a format that enables uniform electronic reporting (the Esef report) pursuant to Chapter 16, Section 4 a of the Swedish Securities Market Act (2007:528) for H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) for the financial year 2021-12-01 \u2013 2022-11-30.\n\nOur examination and our opinion relate only to the statutory requirements.\n\nIn our opinion, the Esef report has been prepared in a format that, in all material respects, enables uniform electronic reporting.\n\nBasis for opinion\n\nWe have performed the examination in accordance with FAR\u2019s recommendation RevR 18 Examination of the Esef report. Our responsibility under this recommendation is described in more detail in the Auditors\u2019 responsibility section. We are independent of H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nResponsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of the Esef report in accordance with the Chapter 16, Section 4 a of the Swedish Securities Market Act (2007:528), and for such internal control that the Board of Directors and the Managing Director determine is necessary to prepare the Esef report without material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nAuditor\u2019s responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance whether the Esef report is in all material respects prepared in a format that meets the requirements of Chapter 16, Section 4(a) of the Swedish Securities Market Act (2007:528), based on the procedures performed.\n\nRevR 18 requires us to plan and execute procedures to achieve reasonable assurance that the Esef report is prepared in a format that meets these requirements.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it is not a guarantee that an engagement carried out according to RevR 18 and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the Esef report.\n\nThe audit firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe examination involves obtaining evidence, through various procedures, that the Esef report has been prepared in a format that enables uniform electronic reporting of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. The procedures selected depend on the auditor\u2019s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement in the report, whether due to fraud or error. In carrying out this risk assessment, and in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, the auditor considers those elements of internal control that are relevant to the preparation of the Esef report by the Board of Directors and the Managing Director, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of those internal controls. The examination also includes an evaluation of the appropriateness and reasonableness of assumptions made by the Board of Directors and the Managing Director.\n\nThe procedures mainly include a validation that the Esef report has been prepared in a valid XHTML format and a reconciliation of the Esef report with the audited annual accounts and consolidated accounts.\n\nFurthermore, the procedures also include an assessment of whether the consolidated statement of financial performance, financial position, changes in equity and cash flow in the Esef report have been marked with iXBRL in accordance with what follows from the Esef regulation.\n\nThe auditor\u2019s opinion regarding the statutory sustainability report\n\nThe board of directors is responsible for the statutory sustainability report on pages 86-107, and that it is prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act.\n\nOur examination has been conducted in accordance with FAR\u2019s auditing standard RevR 12. The auditor\u2019s opinion regarding the statutory sustainability report. This means that our examination of the statutory sustainability report is different and substantially less\nin scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. We believe that the examination has provided us with sufficient basis for our opinion.\n\nA statutory sustainability report has been prepared.\n\nDeloitte AB, was appointed auditor of H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) by the general meeting of the shareholders on the 2022-05-04 and has been the company\u2019s auditor since 2021-05-06.\n\nStockholm, March 23, 2023\n\nDeloitte AB\n\nDidrik Roos\nAuthorized Public Accountant\nKey financial performance measures\n\nThis report contains key financial performance measures in accordance with the framework for financial reporting applied by the H&M group, which is based on IFRS.
