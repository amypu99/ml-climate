I am proud of everything we accomplished in such a short time. In agreement with the Board of Directors, we repositioned ENGIE and refocused our activities around our four core businesses: renewables, of course; energy solutions; networks; and thermal generation with energy supply. We reaffirmed the Group\u2019s industrial approach and the priority we place on operational excellence. We accelerated our growth investments in Renewables and Energy Solutions. As we were engaged in an extremely ambitious transformation, our teams demonstrated exemplary mobilization in the challenging context of the pandemic. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to them. However, I regret our poor results in health and safety. We are fully mobilized and currently strengthening our actions everywhere we operate, both with our teams and with our contractors.\n\nIn concrete terms, what do you consider the highlights of 2021?\n\nJean-Pierre Clamadieu: This year was marked by a historic rise in energy prices that impacted consumers and manufacturers. This price surge adds further meaning to our commitments in terms of social and societal responsibility, in line with our goal to lead a just transition wherever we operate. Guided by our purpose, our strategy \u2013 which places our performance within a comprehensive CSR approach \u2013 contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. Therefore, we are fully reaffirming our historic adherence to the 10 Principles of the United Nations Global Pact.\n\nCatherine MacGregor: There were so many highlights during my first year at ENGIE! We commissioned an additional 3 GW of renewable assets and won major contracts in energy solutions, such as the contract with Georgetown University in the United States or the contract with the City of Paris, which entrusted its cooling network to us for twenty years. We entered into\nseveral strategic partnerships in the renewable gas segment, such as with CMA-CGM to decarbonize maritime transport, or with Masdar in the United Arab Emirates to develop green hydrogen. All while we continued to assist our individual customers in moving toward a decarbonized economy. We also completed the disposal of EQUANS under good terms and conditions. This will offer amazing development opportunities to the teams.\n\n2021 was marked by renewed mobilization on climate change. How is ENGIE positioning itself in this context?\n\nJean-Pierre Clamadieu: 2021 indeed marked a turning point in this area: in the United States, President Biden took the initiative to rejoin the Paris Agreement soon after his inauguration. At COP26, for the first time, governments paved the way for a gradual phase-out of fossil fuels. The framework set up in Paris in 2015 is now complete and functional. For their part, the mobilization of economic players around voluntary coalitions was a remarkable accelerator.\n\nMobilization is also on track in Europe: it has increased its 2030 emissions reduction goal to 55% compared to 1990, and established a \u201cFit for 55\u201d road map. A major transformation of our economy is underway and ENGIE is determined to be a major player.\n\nCatherine MacGregor: In the first half of the year, the Group presented a stronger climate goal to be \u201cNet Zero Carbon\u201d on its three scopes by 2045 by following a \u201cwell below 2\u00b0C\u201d trajectory, currently being certified by SBTi*. All our teams are enthusiastically mobilized around this goal. This is a major commitment in which we have already made progress. I salute their determination to meet the exciting challenges of the energy transition and to build tomorrow\u2019s low-carbon energy system today.\n\nAt a time when the world is experiencing a historic crisis in Ukraine, how is the Group being impacted?\n\nJean-Pierre Clamadieu: ENGIE has strongly condemned the invasion of Ukraine and we have of course committed to comply in every respect with the applicable sanctions. We have expressed our solidarity with the affected populations and our employees affected by these events. Our teams are mobilized and on the ground with the support of the ENGIE Foundation. The Group is solid and we can approach this new crisis with confidence and in a spirit of solidarity.\n\nCatherine MacGregor: As a world player, we assume our responsibilities. ENGIE immediately mobilized all its resources to ensure the safety of its employees affected by the conflict. Our priority is also to ensure the security of supply of our customers. We are currently working to this end by accelerating the filling of our storage facilities and diversifying our gas purchases. In the longer term, this conflict reinforces our ambition to be carbon neutral: to accelerate the decarbonization of our activities, particularly in renewable gases.\n\n*Science Based Targets initiative\nSimplified and refocused, ENGIE is fully committed to implement its sustainable growth strategy and achieve its Net Zero Carbon goal by 2045.\nENGIE, GLOBAL LEADER IN ENERGY TRANSITION\n\nENGIE is a global industry leader in low-carbon energy supply and related services.

The project, which is under construction on the site of a former coal-fired power plant, also symbolizes the transition of ENGIE\u2019s thermal portfolio toward clean, flexible solutions.\nA BUSINESS MODEL THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS\n\nENGIE makes a key contribution to six Sustainable Development Goals and a significant contribution to seven others. The Group\u2019s commitment to tackling the issues highlighted by its stakeholders (see the materiality matrix on p.15), to its CSR commitments and, more generally, to its sustainable growth strategy contribute to strengthening this impact.\n\nClean, affordable energy \u2022 Goal 7.1 \u201cAccess to energy\u201d\n\nIn the current context of rising prices, ENGIE has taken action to maintain affordable access to energy. Thus, in France where ENGIE supplies 8.5 million individual contracts at market prices, more than two-thirds at fixed prices are not affected by the recent increases. Customers with regulated rates benefit from the government price shield. The Group proposes offers to consume less and better, with the possibility in France, for example, of controlling one\u2019s gas heating or delaying one\u2019s consumption of electric heating and thus getting off the electricity grid during peaks in consumption. Finally, for all our customers with financial difficulties, customer representatives are working on payment installments.\n### 6 SDGs for which ENGIE\u2019s contribution is key\n\n| SDG | Description | ENGIE\u2019s Contribution |\n|-----|-------------|----------------------|\n| 5.1 | Fight against discrimination | ENGIE has stepped up its actions to promote gender equality through its commitments to the full participation of women in decision-making and by strengthening access without discrimination to executive and managerial positions.

This situation has led to disruptions in supply chains and a sharp rise in raw materials prices. Indeed, gas prices in Europe and Asia soared dramatically in 2021, partly as a result of the strong economic recovery, but also due to growing geopolitical tensions related to the Ukrainian crisis.\n\nThe price of CO\u2082 on the European carbon market also rose sharply in 2021, from approximately \u20ac33 at the beginning of January to over \u20ac80 at the end of December. While this is a positive development in that it will help accelerate the transition to cleaner energies, in the short term the price increase represents a significant additional cost for consumers, on the back of a sharp rise in gas prices and, as a result, electricity prices. For this reason, public authorities in many countries, particularly in Europe, were compelled to take exceptional and swift measures, ranging from suspending VAT to freezing tariffs and distributing \u201cenergy vouchers\u201d to the most vulnerable households in order to mitigate the impact of this increase.\n\nThe economic recovery was accompanied by a rebound in CO\u2082 emissions, estimated at +5% in 2021, a level slightly below the 2019 level, due in particular to the persistent effects of the crisis, especially in the transportation sector.\n\nThe European Union, and to a lesser extent the United States, made commitments to support the energy transition\n\nIn July 2021, the European Commission overhauled the energy and climate legislation to bring it in line with its new target of cutting GHG emissions by 55% by 2030 (compared to 40% previously) and achieving climate neutrality by 2050. The main changes envisaged involve the strengthening and expansion of the carbon market, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and the development of carbon sinks. It also includes an upward revision of renewable-energy and energy-efficiency objectives.\n\nIn the United States, the major infrastructure investment plan provides for an $86 billion \u201cclimate\u201d package to fund measures to reduce emissions and mitigate the impact of climate change, as well as grant subsidies for green mobility. In addition, the plan earmarks $65 billion to build new power lines and invest in new technologies such as CO\u2082 capture and green hydrogen.\n\nOn the path to carbon neutrality, we need to accelerate progress now in available electricity and gas technologies in order to prepare the resilient and affordable energy mix of tomorrow\n\nIn May 2021, the IEA (International Energy Agency) published a road map for the global energy sector to become carbon neutral by 2050 and limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. The scenario draws on all the different levers required to decarbonize the energy system. The coming decade will be marked by a strong increase in the development of renewable energy sources and efforts in energy efficiency, and accelerated steps in these technologies are relevant now, whatever the technological uncertainties in the longer term.\n\nDecarbonized gases will also be needed in order to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while maintaining a resilient and affordable energy system. Thus, biomethane will play a major role in the energy transition, particularly at the European level. Green hydrogen is set to become the key energy vector in this transition, with numerous recovery plans providing specific funding (\u20ac7 billion in France, \u20ac9 billion in Germany) for the development of its value chain. Hydrogen is enabling the decarbonization of many sectors, in particular in industry and the heavy mobility sector, and, as a result, a strong entrepreneurial ecosystem is developing around it, bringing together research organizations, start-ups, SMEs and major groups. In addition, e-fuels synthesized from hydrogen will be an essential element in the decarbonization of the transportation sector.\n\nCCUS (Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage) is also gaining momentum, with the launch of 76 projects in 16 European countries, 13 of which involve the production of low-carbon hydrogen.\n\nFinally, the appropriation of renewable projects by all stakeholders and citizens in particular is key to their acceleration.\n\nClaire Waysand\nExecutive Vice President in charge of the General Secretariat, Strategy, Research & Innovation, Communication\n\nThe fight against climate change is one of the greatest collective challenges and requires the participation of populations. The question of the cost and safety of the energy transition and of the co-construction practices with the regions will be key for its appropriation. As industrialists, we are convinced that energy efficiency will be indispensable and that an energy mix based on a range of energies will ensure a more secure transition and best protect the purchasing power of households and business competitiveness. This is why we are accelerating our development in renewable energies and in renewable gases, biomethane and green hydrogen, which will be key for sectors that are difficult to decarbonize otherwise, such as heavy mobility and certain industrial uses.\n\n1 By 2030, solar and wind renewable capacities are expected to increase by 630 GW and 390 GW annually, and global biogas production is expected to reach more than 1500 TWh (NZE (Net Zero Emissions) scenario, IEA)\n2 Source: IFRI (Institut Fran\u00e7ais des Relations Internationales - French Institute of International Relations) study, September 2021\nPRIORITIES SHARED WITH STAKEHOLDERS\n\nENGIE continuously integrates the views of its internal and external stakeholders into its value creation process through active dialogue. The Group reviewed its materiality matrix in 2020, which has enabled it to identify the 20 priority issues in line with its vision and ecosystem.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe materiality analysis was conducted in three stages:\n\n- **Identification of the issues** related to ENGIE\u2019s activity and the interests of its stakeholders.\n- **Evaluation of the issues by Top Management and stakeholders**: consultation of Top Management and a number of internal and external stakeholders (customers, employees, employee representatives, suppliers, civil society including experts and NGOs, public authorities and the financial community) through some 30 interviews, two panels and 50 questionnaires.\n- **Prioritization of issues**: aggregation and weighting of Group and stakeholder ratings; final positioning of each issue based on four categories: material, major, decisive and fundamental.\n\nMain findings\n\n- **Four fundamental issues**: occupational health and safety, safety and resilience of facilities, ethics and compliance, and diversity and inclusion in the workplace, were identified as permanent and overarching elements of the Group\u2019s activities.\n- **Achieving its low-carbon transformation** while ensuring the sustainable growth of its results seems to be the most important factor for the Group and its stakeholders.\n- **The commitment of employees**, responsible leadership and governance, as well as the increased use of sustainable finance tools, appear to be essential levers for successfully achieving this transformation and ensuring that ENGIE\u2019s actions are consistent with its purpose.\n\nThe results of the materiality matrix confirm the coherence between the expectations of stakeholders and the strategic orientations of ENGIE.\n\nTo learn more: [https://www.engie.com/en/group/social-responsibility](https://www.engie.com/en/group/social-responsibility)\nANTICIPATING AND MANAGING RISKS\n\nThe business environment in which the Group operates may result in financial and non-financial risks, but it may also provide a host of opportunities. ENGIE constantly analyzes the evolution of these risks and opportunities in order to adapt to changes in its environment in an agile manner.\n\nSignificant and priority risks\n\nThe significant and specific risks to which the Group believes it is exposed are presented in the Universal Registration Document. They have been assessed and prioritized on the basis of \u201cnet risk\u201d after the control resources put in place are taken into account.\n\nFour risks with high criticality were identified in 2021. They are:\n\n\u2022 the risk of changes in the regulatory framework and in the amount of provisions set aside for the decommissioning of Belgian nuclear power plants and the management of spent fuel;\n\u2022 the risk of a downward trend in compensation on gas distribution, transmission, storage and regasification assets in France;\n\u2022 the market risk associated with raw materials;\n\u2022 the currency risk.\n\nThe management of these risks is based on regular, detailed dialog with the competent institutional authorities.\n\nFor raw materials market risk and currency risk, the Group has specific governance and control policies in place.\n\nEach year, the Board of Directors identifies a number of priority risks, each of which is overseen by a member of the Executive Committee and monitored by one of the Board\u2019s standing committees. The majority of these risks are reviewed by the Audit Committee.\n\nClimate change risk, which the Group has long taken into account, is a multifaceted risk that highlights the multiple vulnerabilities of companies, particularly those in the energy sector. This risk is identified as a priority by the Group, which is reviewed annually by the EESDC. The EESDC\u2019s analysis led ENGIE to strengthen its ambition to combat climate change, in particular by setting a Net Zero Carbon target for 2045.\n\nClimate change also represents a source of strategic opportunities. These opportunities translate into the possibility for the Group to accelerate its development in renewables and to increase the supply of renewable energy to local authority or business customers by providing them with certificates of guarantee of origin. The Group will also be able to rely on its expertise to advise its customers and support them in their energy transition by helping them to reduce their energy consumption and make their energy mix green. The transition to a low-carbon economy also presupposes the development of numerous renewable gas production units throughout the region, in the gas infrastructures, through injection into the networks, they will find an available, competitive, safe and accessible transmission and storage offer. Existing networks will also be able to benefit from the industrial development of hydrogen production.\n\nAnticipating risks across the entire supply chain\n\nClimate impacts on the supply chain are factored into supplier default risk and may lead to business continuity plans being put in place. Climate impact and carbon emissions reduction measures have also been added to the supplier selection criteria. In 2021, the strong increase in global demand led to major price hikes in commodities and transportation costs. These strong tensions affected delivery times and constituted a new risk for ENGIE. In response, the Procurement Department established a specific trend chart to anticipate price trends and implemented an action plan. This plan includes the introduction of new price revision clauses in contracts (to avoid overestimating the change in supplier prices), a monthly discussion with the main suppliers to secure prices and availability, and increased vigilance regarding dependence on a single or small number of suppliers.\n\nFor more information: Universal Registration Document Chapter 2 \u201cRisk factors and control\u201d\n\n1 - Chapter 2 Risk factors and control\n2 - Section 4.1.2.4 \u201cStanding Committees\u201d of Chapter 2.\nENGIE\u2019s strategy has been developed taking into account the changes in its environment as well as the expectations of its stakeholders. It aims to strengthen the company\u2019s position as a leader when it comes to achieving an economically viable, resilient and sustainable transition. It is based on four main pillars.\n\n1. **Simplifying and refocusing**\n   - the Group on its core activities to seize opportunities in a buoyant energy market\n\n2. **Adapting**\n   - our organization with a consolidated industrial approach\n\n3. **Accelerating**\n   - our growth in Renewables and Local Energy Networks\n\n4. **Strengthening**\n   - our commitment to the energy transition with an ambitious \u201cNet Zero Carbon\u201d target by 2045 in all scopes\n\n**Simplifying the Group and adapting its organization**\n\nIn 2021, ENGIE refocused on its core activities and on a smaller geographical footprint. A new organization, in place since July 1, 2021, in four Global Business Units (Renewables, Energy Solutions, Networks, Thermal Generation and Energy Supply) and four regional hubs (Europe, North America, South America, Asia-Middle East-Africa) will allow the Group to strengthen its industrial approach.\n\nAs part of its refocus, in the second half of the year, the Group entered into exclusive negotiations with Bouygues for the disposal of EQUANS for \u20ac7.1 billion. It also completed the disposal of ENDEL, its subsidiary specialized in industrial maintenance and energy services, and sold a stake of 11.5% in GRTgaz. The partial sale of GTT and the sale of ENGIE EPS were finalized in 2021.\n\nENGIE is also focused on narrowing its geographic footprint by drawing on its strong relationships with local stakeholders. As a result, the Group will be present in fewer than 30 countries by 2023, compared to 70 in 2018.\n\nThe organization into four Global Business Units responsible for their results and the worldwide implementation of the strategy in their business segments will strengthen the Group\u2019s industrial integration and the competitiveness of its businesses.\n\nThis reorganization was guided in particular by an internal performance target, a key component of the new strategic road map. ENGIE has committed to a performance plan for the 2021-2023 period for an amount of \u20ac600 million. This plan will be based on a variety of levers: reorganization of support functions, purchases, shared service centers, real estate and digital. In 2021, this plan contributed \u20ac85 million to the 2021 EBIT.\nAccelerating and strengthening our commitment\n\nRENEWABLES\n\nOur strategy: Developing green energy production resources in an integrated system.\n\nAs a key player in the sector, ENGIE is stepping up investments in renewable energies, with a target to increase its capacities by 4 GW per year on average by 2025, and by 6 GW per year by 2026. Investments will be made in onshore wind power and ground-mounted solar power. Offshore wind power is also a key priority, with a target of 5 to 7 GW commissioned or in the pipeline by 2025.\n\nWhere we stand:\nThe acceleration in renewable energy was marked in 2021 with the acquisition, in partnership with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, of Eolia, one of the largest renewable energy producers in Spain. Over the period of 2019-2021, the Group commissioned 9 GW of renewable capacity. It plans to again accelerate the development of its annual additional renewable energy capacities, which will then be 4 GW on average per year by 2025 and reach 50 GW at the end of 2025. To do so, it has identified a set of projects for a capacity of approximately 66 GW.\n\nInterview with Paulo Almirante, Executive Vice President in charge of Renewables, Energy Management and Nuclear Activities\n\nWhere does ENGIE stand in terms of its objective to step up its renewable energy production to reach 50 GW by 2025 and 80 GW by 2030?\n\nIn line with what was announced at the beginning of 2019, ENGIE commissioned an additional 9 GW between 2019 and 2021, i.e. 3 GW per year, despite challenging circumstances related to Covid-19 in 2020 and supply chain tensions in 2021. By end-2021, the Group had a total installed renewables capacity of 34 GW. And ENGIE is ramping up the development of renewable energy in order to reach 50 GW of installed capacity by 2025. Most of this new capacity will be achieved through organic growth and will originate from wind and solar power projects. In the second half of the decade, between 2026 and 2030, an average of 6 GW of additional renewable capacities will be commissioned per year, with offshore wind power making a significant contribution. ENGIE can rely on a solid projects portfolio and highly experienced teams in achieving these ambitious but attainable goals.\n\nWhat is your road map for 2022?\n\nIn 2022, our goal is to increase the Group\u2019s installed renewables capacity by 4 GW. We will commission major wind and solar power projects, such as Moray East, a 1 GW offshore wind farm in Scotland. We will also continue to improve the operational performance of projects and assets, with workplace safety a top priority. The Group\u2019s objective is both to respond to the sustained growth in energy demand and to actively contribute to decarbonization, in line with ENGIE\u2019s commitment to achieving Net Zero Carbon by 2045.\n\nENERGY SOLUTIONS\n\nOur strategy: Offering integrated decarbonization solutions to our customers through long-term contracts.\n\nThe Group will focus on the development of decentralized energy networks (urban heating and cooling networks, on-site utility production, decentralized solar power, urban networks and low-carbon mobility), as well as on related services, with a target of 8 GW commissioned by 2025.\n\nWhere we stand:\nAfter a period of uncertainty due to the pandemic, the year 2021 was marked by the resumption of the commercial development of Energy Solutions\u2019 activities. Several major contracts were won, including the contract with the City of Paris in December 2021. ENGIE and its partner Groupe RATP were selected to manage the cooling network. They obtained the renewal of a 20-year concession that covers the production, storage, transmission and distribution of cooling for the city. ENGIE will also be responsible for extending the network by 158 km by 2042, in order to serve all the districts of Paris and to open it up to new customers (hospitals, day-care centers, schools and retirement homes).\n**NETWORKS**\n\nOur strategy: invest in high-performance networks, designed to achieve a balanced, carbon-neutral energy mix.\n\nThe strategy has four main objectives: to maximize the value of existing assets; to rebalance the portfolio to include international markets and electrical grids; to promote the production of biomethane in France and a number of other target countries internationally; and to convert assets to hydrogen.\n\n**Where we stand:**\n\nThe Networks activity continued its international development with the start of commercial operations of Gralha Azul and the first power tests on Novo Estado, two electricity transmission lines built by the Group in Brazil. The gas networks in France have maintained high reliability and recorded solid performance, both in operational efficiency and in the development of renewable gases, where 147 new biomethane production sites were connected to the ENGIE network. This brings the total number of connected sites to 351, a possible contribution to annual production that may reach 6.1 TWh.\n\n---\n\n**THERMAL GENERATION AND ENERGY SUPPLY**\n\nOur strategy: Developing and operating low-carbon activities and supporting the transition of current electricity systems.\n\nIn addition to investments in renewables, the Group is focusing on the development of its thermal capacity, in line with its carbon emissions reduction pathway. Depending on the specific needs of each country, ENGIE meets the flexibility needs of the electricity system and supports the decarbonization of its customers. The phase-out of coal capacities is underway, and the first initiatives to convert to green gas plants have been launched, primarily using biomethane and hydrogen.\n\n**Where we stand:**\n\nThese activities offer significant flexibility in a context of intermittent renewable energies and contribute to the security of future supply. In 2021, they again demonstrated their reliability by recording an unplanned internal unavailability rate of less than 5%. On October 31, 2021, the combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) projects at Vilvorde (Belgium) and at the Awirs site, each with a capacity of 875 MW, were selected for a 15-year contract in the first auctions of the Capacity Remuneration Mechanism in Belgium. These plants will be able to use green gases and will move over the long-term to carbon neutrality. The Group entered into a strategic alliance with MASDAR in the United Arab Emirates to develop green hydrogen throughout the Gulf countries. The plan to exit from coal continued with the disposal of Jorge Lacerda in Brazil and the end of operations at Tejo (Portugal), its last coal-fired power plant in Europe.\n\n---\n\n**Interview with S\u00e9bastien Arbola,**\n\nExecutive Vice President in charge of Thermal Generation and Energy Supply activities\n\n**What is your road map for 2022?**\n\nENGIE is committed to being net zero by 2045. The challenge for the Thermal Generation & Energy Supply GBU is to continue to provide the flexibility that ENGIE and the electricity system require while reducing its CO\u2082 emissions. This means growing our business selectively, greening our asset portfolio and helping our industrial and individual customers to achieve carbon neutrality.\n\nWe will also continue to strengthen our industrial expertise and our digital know-how with regard to managing operations. This means making our power plants more flexible and responsive, while guaranteeing the highest level of occupational health and safety for our teams and cybersecurity for our sites.\n\n**What challenges are associated with hydrogen as regards ENGIE\u2019s strategy?**\n\nRenewable hydrogen is the link between the Group\u2019s strategic pillars, namely renewables, networks and customer decarbonization. ENGIE has therefore set ambitious goals and is developing projects that position the Group among the world leaders in this field.\n\nAs of today, ENGIE\u2019s portfolio includes more than 70 projects worldwide, aimed in particular at developing hydrogen ecosystems for industry and mobility, export chains and hydrogen transport and storage demonstration facilities. The next step is to move to industrial scale through key partnerships, industry collaboration and strong public support.\nGLOBAL VALUE CREATION\n\nENGIE aims to create value in the medium and long term for the benefit of all its stakeholders. The Group\u2019s performance is guided by setting objectives in three categories: planet, people and economic prosperity.\n\n### OUR DECARBONIZATION TARGETS\n\n|                                | 2019 Results | 2020 Results | 2021 Results | 2030 Target |\n|--------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Renewable electricity production capacities (GW) (@100%, excluding turbine pumping and decentralized capacities) | 27 | 31 | 34 excluding EQUANS 34 | 80 |\n| Share of renewable power generation capacity | 28% | 31% | 34% excluding EQUANS 34 | 58% |\n| Carbon footprint of energy production (Mt CO\u2082 eq.) - Scopes 1 and 3 | 75 | 68 | 67 excluding EQUANS 65 | 43 (vs. 106 in 2017) |\n| Carbon footprint related to gas sales (Mt CO\u2082 eq.) - Scope 3 | 61 | 61 | 66 excluding EQUANS 66 | 52 (vs. 79 in 2017) |\n| Customer decarbonization: emissions avoided through ENGIE products and services (Mt CO\u2082 eq.) | N/A | 21 | 28 excluding EQUANS 26 | 45 |\n| Supplier decarbonization (excluding energy): share certified or aligned with SBT | N/A | 15% | 20% excluding EQUANS 20% | 100% |\n| Decarbonization of our work practices: GHG emissions (Mt CO\u2082 eq.) after offsetting - maximum of 200 kt CO\u2082 | 0.68 | 0.49 | 0.58 excluding EQUANS 0.30 | 0 |\n\n### OUR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES\n\n|                                | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2030 |\n|--------------------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Share of activities (projects, sites, including sites being decommissioned) with a coordinated environmental plan | 0%   | 21%  | 37% excluding EQUANS 38% | 100% |\n| Share of industrial sites having implemented ecological management * | 0%   | 0%   | 28% excluding EQUANS 28% | 100% |\n| Rate of reduction of water consumption of industrial activities compared with 2019 | 0%   | -19% | +8% excluding EQUANS +8% | -35% vs 2019 |\n\n* Incorporation in the Vigilance Plan \u25cf Incorporation in the Commitments Committee reviews (CSR matrix) \u25cf Incorporation in the compensation criteria for the CEO and top managers \u25cf Actions vis-\u00e0-vis suppliers\n\nConcerning green gases, see page 31\n\n* i.e. maintenance of green spaces that respect nature without chemical phytosanitary products\nENGIE, certified 2\u00b0C by SBT, is committed to reducing its GHG emissions, in particular those linked to the energy production of its controlled assets (scope 1) or equity-accounted assets (scope 3) and its indirect emissions, including gas sales (scope 3 item). Nevertheless, ENGIE has chosen to go beyond the current SBTi 2\u00b0C certification obtained in 2020, by following a \u201cwell below 2 degrees\u201d path, which translates into a reduction in GHG emissions from electricity and heat generation to a maximum of 43 Mt CO\u2082 eq. in 2030 (against 106 Mt CO\u2082 eq in 2017), but also by reducing the carbon intensity of this production by more than 52% over this period to reach 230 gCO\u2082 eq./kWh in 2025, then 158 gCO\u2082 eq/kWh in 2030 (compared to 348 gCO\u2082 eq/kWh in 2017).\n\n**GHG emissions from energy production (Mt CO\u2082 eq.)**\n\nThe SBT target covers the carbon intensity of the energy production, i.e. to reach 165 g CO\u2082 eq. kWh corresponding to the commitment of a 52% reduction compared to the carbon intensity of energy production in 2017 (scopes 1 and 3). In line with this SBT target, ENGIE has set a target of 43 Mt CO\u2082 eq. for energy production emissions in 2030 (scopes 1 and 3).\n\n**Scope 3 GHG emissions**\n\nScope 3 indirect emissions are down due to the exit of EQUANS, which impacts emissions related to purchases.\n\n**Change in renewables capacity (GW (@100%))**\n\nThe renewable capacity of centralized electricity products recognized at 100% rose +3 GW in 2021.\n\n**Change in coal capacity (GW (@100%))**\n\nENGIE has made a commitment to phase out coal by 2025 in Europe and by 2027 in the rest of the world. In 2021, the Group closed the Tejo power plant in Portugal and sold the Jorge Lacerda power plant in Brazil. Its coal capacity at the end of 2021 was 2.9 GW.\n### People\n\n| OUR KEY OBJECTIVES | 2019 Results | 2020 Results | 2021 Results | 2030 Target |\n|--------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Share of women managers | 23.5% | 24% | 24.6% excluding EQUANS 28.9% | 50% |\n| Gender equity index | France: 72 international: 72 | France: 87 international: 80 | France: 89, excluding EQUANS 89 international: 82, excluding EQUANS 83 | 100/100 |\n| Lost time injury frequency rate for Group employees and subcontractors on closed sites | 3.3 | 2.7 | 2.9 excluding EQUANS 2.5 | \u2264 2.3 |\n| Health and safety prevention rate | 0.42 | 0.59 | 0.58 excluding EQUANS 0.65 | 0.75 |\n| Percentage of apprentices in Europe | 3.3% | 4.3% | 4.6% excluding EQUANS 4.9% | 10% |\n| Percentage of trained staff | 69% | 70% | 82% excluding EQUANS 82% | 100% |\n| Beneficiaries with access to sustainable energy since 2018 (excluding the Rassembleurs d\u2019\u00c9nergies fund) (m) | 4 | 6 | 7 | 30 |\n| Share of activities (projects, sites, including sites being decommissioned) with a coordinated societal plan (%) | N/A | 10% | 37% excluding EQUANS 37% | 100% |\n| Responsible Purchasing Index (CSR assessment and inclusive purchasing, excluding energy purchases) | N/A | 25 | 40 excluding EQUANS 40 | 100% |\n| Training rate for employees most exposed to the risk of corruption (%) | 25% | 21% | 51% 49% excluding EQUANS | 100% |\n\n- Incorporated in the Vigilance Plan\n- Incorporated in the Commitments Committee reviews (CSR matrix)\n- Incorporated in the compensation criteria for the CEO and top managers\n- Actions vis-a-vis suppliers\n\n### Economic prosperity\n\n| INDICATOR (Published data) | 2019 Results | 2020 Results | 2021 Results | Financial outlook for 2023 | Deadlines |\n|-----------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------------|-----------|\n| Growth investments (\u20ac bn)   | 7.2          | 4.0          | 4.3          | \u20ac15-\u20ac16 bn approximately \u20ac5 bn | 2021-2023 2024 |\n| Asset rotation program (disposals) (\u20ac bn) | 2.8 | 4.2 | 2.0 | > \u20ac11 bn for an initial target of \u20ac9-10 bn | 2021-2023 |\n| Performance program (\u20ac m)   | 330          | 670          | 85           | \u20ac600 m continuation in line with 2022-2023 | 2021-2023 2024 |\n| EBIT (\u20ac bn)                 | 5.8          | 4.6          | 6.1          | \u20ac6.1-6.5 bn \u20ac6.2-6.6 bn \u20ac6.4-6.8 bn | 2022 2023 2024 |\n| Economic net debt/EBITDA ratio | 4.0x         | 4.0x         | 3.6x         | Less than or equal to 4.0x | 2022-2024 |\n| Net recurring income, Group share (NRIs) (\u20ac bn) | 2.7 | 1.7 | 2.9 | \u20ac3.1-3.3 bn \u20ac3.2-3.4 bn \u20ac3.3-3.5 bn | 2022 2023 2024 |\n| Dividend payout rate/Net recurring income, Group share | 0% | 75% | 66% | 65-75% with \u20ac0.65 floor dividend | 2022-2024 2021-2023 |\n| Credit rating               | Strong investment grade | Strong investment grade | | | 2022-2024 |\nCOMMITMENTS FOR COLLECTIVE PROGRESS\n\nENGIE draws on a set of global or specific networks and coalitions that support it in order to advance its practices and create sustainable value for all its stakeholders.\n\nSocietal commitments\n\nDiversity\n\nAnti-discrimination and harassment\n\nYouth employability\n\nTaxation\n\nConsumption\n\nEnvironmental commitments\n\nGeneral commitments\n\nClimate\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions\n\nCarbon pricing\n\nBiodiversity\n\nWater\n\nStrengthening our commitments at COP 26\n\nENGIE was present at COP 26 in Glasgow and reaffirmed its commitment to decarbonization through several initiatives, including:\n\n\u2022 As a founding member of the First Movers coalition \u2013 which seeks to accelerate the development of a competitive, carbon-neutral supply chain \u2013 ENGIE is committed to ensuring that 10% of the steel in its wind turbines is near zero-carbon by 2030.\n\n\u2022 The Group reaffirmed its commitment to renewable hydrogen by supporting, as a key industrial partner, the signing of an agreement between Chile and Belgium to produce and import green hydrogen.\n\n\u2022 ENGIE has also signed pledges \u2013 commitments made by public or private partners on key themes to advance the energy transition. For example, the Group signed the \u201c24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Compact\u201d with Google, which brings together tech and energy companies for the purpose of developing solutions that provide carbon-free energy for all, in real time 24/7.\n\nThe Group has also signed appeals for governments to promote the development of impact finance through Finance for Tomorrow or to reduce inequalities linked to the energy crisis and the future transition policy.\nENGIE pursues its purpose each and every day: accelerating the transition to a carbon-neutral economy.\n\nP.26 Reducing our impact on the climate and the environment\nP.28 Accelerating the transition to a carbon-neutral economy\nP.30 Renewable gas, an essential energy source for carbon neutrality\nP.34 A value shared with our stakeholders\nP.36 Promoting sustainable and responsible finance\nP.38 A collective commitment to the transition\nREDUCING OUR IMPACT ON THE CLIMATE AND THE ENVIRONMENT\n\nENGIE recognizes that its ability to grow depends on the quality of the environment in which it operates. It is committed at all levels to adapting its activities in order to preserve the environment and accelerate its transition to zero carbon.\n\nOur approach to carbon neutrality\n\nBased on the work of the Net Zero Initiative, ENGIE will deem Net Zero to be achieved when the Group\u2019s carbon footprint is fully offset through greenhouse gas (GHG) sequestration (negative emissions). The Group is focused on reducing its carbon footprint in order to use carbon offsets as little as possible. It is also committed to supporting its customers on their path to decarbonization, while ensuring that the emissions avoided as a result of this process do not count towards its own path to carbon neutrality.\n\nENGIE\u2019S CARBON NEUTRALITY\n(based on the work of the Net Zero Initiative)\n\nGHG EMISSIONS\nFirst, reduce the direct and indirect GHG emissions resulting from ENGIE\u2019s activities\nScopes 1, 2 and 3\n\nGHG EMISSIONS SEQUESTRATION\nThen, increase carbon sinks to offset emissions and achieve carbon neutrality\nSequestration of GHGs generated directly or indirectly by ENGIE\u2019s value chain\n\nOFF-BALANCE-SHEET\n\nCUSTOMER DECARBONIZATION\nReducing customers\u2019 GHG emissions through ENGIE\u2019s products and services\nEmissions avoided or reduced\n\nBIOGENIC EMISSIONS\nCarbon contained in agricultural or forestry biomass, emitted during its combustion or degradation.\n\n2021 will be remembered as a key year in the operational implementation of the Group\u2019s decarbonization strategy. Since 2021, ENGIE has had a carbon budget for each GBU and remuneration criteria for the Group\u2019s managers that take GHG emissions into account. There is no question that CO\u2082 has become a factor in corporate governance.\n\nPrakash Morankar\nConstruction & HSE Manager for India, Renewables GBU\n\nSolar power in India\n\nIn August 2021, ENGIE commissioned a 200 MW solar farm in the Indian state of Gujarat \u2013 the second largest in the country for the Group. The complex environment, close to the largest salt plain in India, meant that the project required specialized engineering. The innovative technical solutions that were implemented enabled the project team to win the \u201cSolar Project of the Year\u201d award.\nAdapting to the consequences of climate change\n\nENGIE\u2019s adaptation plan aims to reduce the exposure of the Group\u2019s assets and activities to the risks associated with climate change (physical risks and transition risks). It is based on 3 pillars that meet the TCFD commitments:\n\n- Assessing the impact of climate change and adapting ENGIE\u2019s facilities and operational activities (contracts, insurance, health and safety, continuity plans, etc.).\n- Assessing the impact of climate change on ENGIE\u2019s finances.\n- Assessing the impact of climate change on ENGIE\u2019s strategy, both in terms of the Group\u2019s exposure and new opportunities.\n\nPreserving nature and biodiversity\n\nIn view of the fact that the preservation of biodiversity and the fight against climate change are intrinsically linked, and that the company\u2019s activities constantly interact with natural ecosystems, ENGIE has adopted a proactive policy aimed at reducing and controlling its footprint on biodiversity. Since 2012, the Group\u2019s strategy has been based on a cross-functional approach \u2013 avoiding, reducing and offsetting \u2013 and four major areas: raising awareness of biodiversity and improving the Group\u2019s skills on the ground, strengthening its commitments to preserve biodiversity, developing innovative solutions to preserve biodiversity on sites and ensuring transparent practices for external stakeholders. This strategy can be broken down into six concrete objectives:\n\n| Avoid Reduce Offset | Group targets | Actions taken in 2021 |\n|---------------------|---------------|-----------------------|\n| Implementation of the \u201cAvoid - Reduce - Offset\u201d workflow in the Group\u2019s development projects | 100% project files greater than \u20ac30 million submitted to the Group Investment Committee in 2022 | Project files reviewed |\n\n| Nature-based solutions | Group targets | Actions taken in 2021 |\n|------------------------|---------------|-----------------------|\n| Contribution to the implementation of nature-based solutions (NbS) in the regions | 10 projects identified that comply with the IUCN standard by 2022 | Identification of solutions that comply with the IUCN standard |\n\n| Ecological site management | Group targets | Actions taken in 2021 |\n|---------------------------|---------------|-----------------------|\n| Implementation of ecological site management for all of the Group\u2019s industrial activities, with no phytosanitary products used and maintenance of green spaces in harmony with nature | 2025: 50% of sites | 28% of sites maintained without having recourse to chemical phytosanitary products |\n\n| Priority sites for biodiversity* | Group targets | Actions taken in 2021 |\n|----------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------|\n| Continued development of action plans for sites located in or near a biodiversity hotspot anywhere in the world, using the new definition of a priority site | 2025: 50% of sites with action plans established with relevant stakeholders | 41% of action plans deployed |\n\n| Supply chain | Group targets | Actions taken in 2021 |\n|--------------|---------------|-----------------------|\n| Integration of biodiversity criteria in life cycle assessments in order to perform an in-depth analysis of the impacts and dependencies related to the Group\u2019s activities throughout the value chain, with a view to identifying the issues and the appropriate solutions to tackle them | Analysis of at least 2 activities per year by 2025 | Analysis of 2 activities via life-cycle assessment |\n\n| Awareness \u2013 Sharing | Group targets | Actions taken in 2021 |\n|---------------------|---------------|-----------------------|\n| Provision of biodiversity awareness modules for all staff and creation of a platform for sharing best practices | At least 2 modules/year by 2025 2022-2023: 3,000 employees/year | Training modules created and made available online. Around 300 employees trained in 3 months. |\n\nCombining agroforestry and wind power to preserve biological diversity\n\nIn order to compensate for a loss of habitat for farmland fauna linked to the establishment of the Mont de la Gr\u00e9vi\u00e8re wind farm in France, ENGIE Green sponsored the planting of agroforestry trees on 18 hectares of agricultural plots in 2016. In 2019, we began assessing the effectiveness of this initiative by undertaking environmental monitoring of these plots in partnership with the Association Fran\u00e7aise d\u2019Agroforesterie (French Agroforestry Association) and the Regroupement des Naturalistes Ardennais (Ardennes naturalists group). The findings in this first year of monitoring were promising: water percolated 11 times faster where there were trees than elsewhere; the number of insects per hectare was nearly four times higher than in the control plots; and species diversity was more than 10 times higher. To even out the effects of weather-related fluctuations, we will monitor the progress of this measure for at least five years.\n\n* This objective is included in the 2030 CSR objective of implementing environmental plans for all sites, activities and projects in consultation with stakeholders.\nACCELERATING THE TRANSITION TO A CARBON-NEUTRAL ECONOMY\n\nENGIE has set itself objectives that extend beyond its main energy production and sales activities in order to support its main stakeholders \u2013 employees, suppliers and customers \u2013 on a decarbonization pathway.\n\nReducing the carbon footprint of our activities\n\nEmissions related to the production and sale of energy represent approximately 74% of ENGIE\u2019s carbon footprint. The Group aims to achieve its Net Zero objective by 2045 by making a large-scale transition to decarbonized energy production and limiting the residual emissions to be offset as much as possible. To strengthen its impact, ENGIE also supports its employees and suppliers in reducing their carbon footprint.\n\nA global platform of 34 GW of renewable capacity (GW@100%)\n\nInvolving our employees in the decarbonization of their work processes\n\nENGIE has set itself the goal of making its work processes \u2013 related to buildings, digital technology, travel, commuting and vehicle fleets \u2013 carbon neutral by 2030. Employees are involved in such processes so as to identify and share best practices. This approach is complemented by an ongoing training program.\n\nSupporting our suppliers in achieving carbon neutrality\n\nIn line with its objective of decarbonizing its value chain, ENGIE has undertaken to support its 250 preferred suppliers in order for them to become certified or aligned with the Science Based Targets by 2030. To this end, ENGIE organized a series of meetings aimed at establishing concrete action plans for decarbonization. In 2021, more than 40 such meetings were organized. This approach will ultimately be extended to all of the Group\u2019s Class A suppliers (80% of expenditure excluding energy), i.e. 1,500 suppliers in 2030 and nearly 7,000 companies in the longer term.\n\nStrengthening wind power generation in North America\n\nIn May 2021, ENGIE commissioned Dakota Range III in North America. Established since 2018, the site includes 32 wind turbines with a generation capacity of 151.2 MW. The Group entered into a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Northern States Power Company and now powers a Google data center in Minnesota.\nSupporting and measuring our customers\u2019 decarbonization\n\nCustomer decarbonization is effective when customers avoid1 or reduce2 their carbon emissions through the use of ENGIE products and services. Due to the lack of international and cross-sector standards, ENGIE developed specific energy guidelines with a group of peers and NGOs for the purpose of measuring the contribution of products and services to customer decarbonization. In this regard, ENGIE set itself the goal in 2021 of helping its customers achieve decarbonization of 45 Mt CO\u2082 eq. by 2030, based on a dozen of the Group\u2019s products and services, such as green energy production, decentralized energy networks and associated services, or the resale of green electricity. This decarbonization measure is implemented in new commercial projects and integrated as a criterion in the investment decision process.\n\nWhether it\u2019s manufacturers, cities, universities, etc., the Group is developing decarbonization pathways adapted to each specific case:\n\n| MANUFACTURERS | UNIVERSITIES | CITIES |\n|---------------|--------------|--------|\n| **FAURECIA decarbonization partner** | **Promoting sustainable energy at Georgetown University** | **A sustainable district cooling system in Singapore** |\n| Faurecia, a global leader in automotive technology, chose ENGIE to assist it in its commitment to achieve CO\u2082 neutrality for scopes 1 and 2 by 2025. As part of this partnership, ENGIE will provide energy solutions to be implemented at over 100 sites worldwide by mid-2022. ENGIE will support Faurecia in rolling out an energy performance program in Europe, China, Brazil and Mexico, which will result in a 15% reduction in energy consumption at sites. | ENGIE and Georgetown University (in the United States) have entered into a long-term agreement to strengthen Georgetown\u2019s energy infrastructure while improving its energy efficiency. ENGIE will handle the upgrade, operation and maintenance of the electrical, heating, cooling and water distribution systems. The partnership will enable the university to reduce its energy use by at least 35% by 2030 and ensure the sustainable energy management of one of the most prestigious academic communities. | ENGIE was selected to build and operate the underground district cooling system for Singapore\u2019s first smart business district, Punggol Digital District. Scheduled for completion in 2024, the underground plant will be in operation for a period of 30 years. The district cooling system will provide reliable, sustainable and cost-effective air conditioning for the district. The plant is expected to reduce emissions by 3,700 tons of CO\u2082 per year and achieve up to a 30% reduction in energy consumption compared to traditional commercial buildings. |\n\nInterview with C\u00e9cile Pr\u00e9vieu, Executive Vice President in charge of Energy Solutions activities\n\n**How is ENGIE supporting its customers in their decarbonization strategies?**\n\nOur support focuses on two main areas: the reduction of energy consumption and the greening of production methods. We work with our customers across the entire value chain, from the assessment of their specific situation, through engineering and construction, to the operation of the appropriate energy network. To do this, we use several levers: recognized technical expertise in our businesses coupled with a geographical footprint that guarantees a sound knowledge of local issues and close proximity to our customers; the ability to finance the solutions we implement; and commercial production through rolling out multi-site solutions based on a global geographical presence.\n\n**What are the main challenges and priorities for 2022?**\n\nAs we saw during COP 26, many customers are committing to ambitious emission reduction targets in an increasingly short time frame. That is excellent news but also poses a challenge. Our role is to offer them the best strategies and solutions to achieve this, which means we have to step up our development of low-carbon networks and services for our customers in 2022 and to continuously innovate. Our recent commitment to the City of Paris to extend its cooling network by an additional 158 km by 2042 as part of an effort to decarbonize and adapt to climate change is a perfect example.\n\n---\n\n1 Avoided emissions - difference between the situation of a benchmark customer on the market and one that has implemented an ENGIE product or service.\n2 Reduced emissions - difference between a customer\u2019s historical situation and the situation after implementing an ENGIE product or service.\nRENEWABLE GASES, AN ESSENTIAL ENERGY SOURCE FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY\n\nAs a renewable resource, biomethane is a component of the circular economy. Though it remains marginal in the global energy mix, it is an energy source of the future that is needed, alongside low-carbon hydrogen and synthetic gases, to achieve carbon neutrality.\n\nWhat are renewable gases?\n\n**Biogas**\nRenewable gas obtained from a natural process: the fermentation of organic matter. The production of biogas makes it possible to recover organic waste from agricultural (manure, residues) or urban (sludge, food waste) environments.\n\n**Biomethane**\nA gas with a very high methane concentration derived from biogas purification and injected into the networks. BioNGV or bioLNG (or liquefied biomethane) are used as clean fuels.\n\n**Renewable hydrogen**\nHydrogen is a gas that is naturally present in the universe. When produced from renewable resources, hydrogen can provide low-CO\u2082 electricity and heat, both directly or through fuel cells. As a highly versatile fuel, hydrogen can be transported and stored in liquid or gaseous form.\n\n**Synthetic methane**\nThis name covers different types of renewable gases (CH\u2084):\n- renewable gases produced from various organic waste according to different processes, such as pyrogasification (a high-temperature thermochemical process that uses waste to produce a gas that can be injected into existing networks) and hydrothermal gasification (a high-pressure, high-temperature thermochemical process for converting liquid biomass into a synthetic gas).\n- gases from methanation processes based on low-carbon hydrogen and carbon.\n\n**Low-carbon hydrogen**\nHydrogen produced with natural gas using various CO\u2082 capture technologies, which allow it to be stored or reused.\n\nHydrogen: an accelerator of decarbonization\n\nTo achieve a carbon-neutral future, ENGIE relies on a diversified energy mix and, in particular, on an ambitious program to develop hydrogen production, transport, storage and distribution capacities. This gas can be stored in underground saline cavities over long periods. It can be injected as a mixture into the gas network, or used in pure form for a variety of purposes, in particular in industry and the mobility sector, or converted into low-carbon electricity. It contributes to solving the problem of the intermittence of renewable energies.\n\nAnother fundamental advantage of hydrogen is the fact that it can be produced from locally established renewable energies, thereby promoting the short energy circuit and local jobs. Thanks to in-depth knowledge of the regions in which it operates and its ability to intervene in the entire value chain - from the development and financing of hydrogen projects to sales to end customers - ENGIE has major assets to bolster its development.\n\nHydrogen is therefore the promise of a new technological, energy and industrial sector, both locally and globally, with new jobs at stake, essential as a contribution to the decarbonization of the energy mix. The governments have understood this: in Europe, more than 10 countries (including France) and the European Commission have published their \u201cNational Hydrogen Strategy\u201d road map, with the related promises of funding.\nGreening gas across the entire value chain\n\nENGIE has set itself the objective in France of greening gas to reach 100% renewable gas by 2050. In particular, the Group is present throughout the entire biomethane chain, from the development of industrialization projects to its distribution. In France, ENGIE BIOZ initiates, develops, finances, builds and operates units for injecting biomethane into the gas network, with a long-term commitment to the regions. In 2021, it inaugurated three methanization units in Sarthe, Ille-et-Vilaine and Haute-Marne in order to produce biomethane by collecting several types of organic matter in the surrounding area. The energy produced can supply thousands of homes and therefore reduce CO2 emissions. At the same time, the Group is working to adapt its networks to inject biomethane, for instance, through the deployment of a temporary storage solution for biomethane when demand falls or the construction of back-up stations on the distribution and transmission networks that make it possible to transport local biomethane surpluses to other regions. At the end of the chain, efficient, low-carbon solutions (such as hybrid heat pumps for heating or high-performance engines for land and sea mobility) are helping customers green their consumption.\n\nA strategic partnership for the decarbonization of maritime transport\n\nThe CMA CGM Group \u2013 a world leader in maritime transport and logistics \u2013 and ENGIE have entered into a long-term strategic and industrial cooperation on projects to produce low-carbon fuels. The goal is to ensure the development of a synthetic methane production and distribution chain that can benefit the maritime transportation sector. An initial project for the production of liquefied biomethane (bioLNG) dedicated to maritime transport has already been initiated at the Marseille Maritime Port Authority, and other industrial projects are in the pipeline. The partnership will facilitate the pooling of knowledge and R&D efforts, particularly in key technologies such as carbon capture and green hydrogen production. Today, liquefied natural gas (LNG) reduces sulfur oxide emissions by 99%, fine particle emissions by 91% and nitrogen oxide emissions by 92%.\n\nKEY FIGURES:\n\n1 million\njobs by 2050 in Europe thanks to renewable energies and low-carbon hydrogen\n\n27,000\nhydrogen charging stations needed by 2030\n\nENGIE\u2019S RENEWABLE GAS TARGETS FOR 2030\n\n4 GW\nof green hydrogen production\nWork was underway in 2021 in the United Arab Emirates.\n\n700 km\nof hydrogen dedicated networks\n(of which 170 km as from 2025)\n\n1 TWh\nof storage capacity dedicated to hydrogen\n(of which 270 GWh as from 2025)\nSee HyPSTER and HYGreen projects underway\n\n+100\nhydrogen charging stations\n(of which 50 as from 2025)\nProject underway with CERTAS\n\n4 TWh\nof biomethane produced\nby ENGIE in France\n2021 results: 0.33 TWh\n\n40 TWh\nof biomethane production\ninjected into ENGIE\u2019s networks in France\n2021 results: 6 TWh\nAdapting networks\n\nThe development of methanization units in France is accompanied by the development of injection points on the network, leading gas distribution and transport networks to adapt their services and methods of operation: taking charge of the operation and maintenance of the injection stations, creating backflows to the transport network in order to unload distribution zones that may be saturated, adapting daily balancing and storage management. Furthermore, the production of hydrogen on an industrial scale requires the development and planning of future transport and storage networks. ENGIE is committed to the European H2 Backbone initiative and is supporting the deployment of a network of nearly 40,000 km of hydrogen networks in 21 countries, two-thirds of which would be made up of existing networks that have been repurposed. This vision is already taking shape through the MosahYc pilot project developed in the Moselle region, which aims to convert two existing gas pipelines to transport pure hydrogen so as to guarantee a secure supply for mobility use (trains, buses, cars, trucks) and industrial purposes. Other R&D projects currently being deployed, such as HyPSTER and Hygreen, aim to experiment with hydrogen storage in salt cavities on sites previously used to store natural gas.\n\nIndustrializing the renewable gas solutions of the future\n\nAfter producing the first cubic meters of green gas from wood in 2020 thanks to the Gaya demonstrator, ENGIE is now aiming to scale up the pyrogasification process. With the Salamandre project, the Group\u2019s objective is to build an industrial biomethane production unit in the port area of Le Havre as early as 2026 in order to gasify nearly 70,000 metric tons of non-recyclable waste per year and produce up to 150 GWh of renewable gas, the equivalent of the consumption of 670 city buses.\n\nThe Group is also developing the M\u00e9thyCentre, a demonstrator aimed at storing electrical energy in the form of renewable gas through hydrogen. Scheduled to be operational by the end of 2022, it will produce 50 kg of green hydrogen per day from renewable electricity \u2013 the equivalent of 15 to 20 full tanks of light vehicles \u2013 as well as methane gas that will be injected into the local gas network.\n\nBased on the same model, the HyPSTER demonstrator will be commissioned in 2023 in a region close to the Zero Emission Valley in the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region and will be used to test hydrogen production and marketing (for mobility and industry) as well as the storage of hydrogen in saline cavities.\n\nENGIE is also developing several initiatives aimed at using hydrogen to decarbonize industry and to develop new industrial sectors:\n\n- The Yuri project in Australia involves converting a fertilizer production plant into a green hydrogen production unit. It is scheduled to be commissioned in 2024.\n- The HyNetherlands project will enable the deployment of an electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen for industry and heavy mobility in the Netherlands from 2025.\n- The Masshylia project aims to develop, build and operate one of the largest renewable hydrogen production sites in France in the South-Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur region.\n- The HyEx project in Chile aims to power an ammonia plant with green hydrogen by 2025.\n\nTo further scale up low-carbon and renewable hydrogen projects, in 2021 ENGIE announced a partnership with Equinor, Norway\u2019s leading energy provider, to explore the development of low-carbon hydrogen value chains in Belgium, the Netherlands and France.\n\nUsing new technologies to reduce methane leakage\n\nENGIE is involved in a European scientific project whose objective is to improve knowledge and the use of new technologies in order to quantify methane emissions in networks and thereby bolster actions to reduce these emissions. 14 European gas network managers and gas associations are involved in the project coordinated by the European Gas Research Group (GERG) and ENGIE is present via GRTgaz\u2019s Research and Innovation Centre (RICE), which has identified the most promising technologies to be tested. In addition to on-site measurements, as close as possible to the equipment, these new remote measurement technologies aim to quantify the overall emissions of a geographical area and give an overall assessment. Embedded in drones, moving vehicles on the ground or in the air, or installed on site, 12 different technologies are being tested to assess their accuracy and reliability. This collective project illustrates the efforts being made by gas operators to significantly reduce methane emissions in order to contribute to short-term climate change mitigation and reinforce the environmental value of gas and gas networks in the energy transition.\nEurope and France have set ambitious carbon-neutrality targets for 2050. Considering that an all-electric energy mix would lead to significant additional costs and would not guarantee security of supply, especially during peak periods, ENGIE is calling for a more balanced alternative in which the decarbonized or low-carbon (CCS) gas vector will continue to play an essential role. France, for example, has significant biomass potential that can now be put to good use to produce biomethane. This will green a number of uses, including industries that are difficult to electrify. In a circular economy, this local resource will not only provide secure supply at competitive costs but also positive externalities for employment and farming. In the medium term, synthetic gases and hydrogen will complete this energy mix.\n\nDrive and support the changes required for the development of renewable gas\n\nInterview with Edouard Sauvage, Executive Vice President in charge of Networks activities\n\nWhat are the main objectives of the Networks GBU in 2022?\n\nOur priority in 2022 will be to ensure the safety of our employees and any third parties working for the Group, as well as the safety of our property, at all Group entities. Our other primary objective will be to guarantee the operational and financial performance of our electricity and gas networks. In France, we are actively preparing the future of our gas networks by developing renewable gas sectors and promoting the key role of gas and gas networks in achieving the energy transition. Lastly, in Brazil, ENGIE will continue the construction of its electric transmission lines.\n\nWhat were the key achievements of the Networks GBU in 2021?\n\nWe should note, first of all, that despite the impacts of the health crisis, we maintained a high level of operational and financial performance in our gas networks, both in France and abroad. In addition, we continued to prepare the future of our gas networks in France. We took many actions to promote and scale up the biomethane sector. As such, we should applaud the fact that, at the end of December 2021, France had 351 units in production for a capacity of 6.2 TWh, two years ahead of the target set by the PPE. We also helped our customers with ambitious projects, as demonstrated by the signing of a partnership agreement with CMA-CGM to support the decarbonization of maritime transport through the development of synthetic methane and bio-LNG. We pursued our innovation efforts as well, with the inauguration of GRTgaz\u2019s R&D platform (FenHYx) and demonstration projects for the conversion of our gas networks to hydrogen (MosaHYc, HYpster, Jupiter 1000, etc.).\n\nLastly, we continued the construction and commissioning of our 2,800 km of electric transmission lines in Brazil (Gralha Azul and Novo Estado projects).\nVALUE DISTRIBUTION IN 2021\n\nThe Group is committed to building sustained dialogue with each of its stakeholders and to sharing its value creation in a fair and balanced manner. In 2021, ENGIE set up a Dialogue Committee with its stakeholders as well as an access space to support sensitive projects.\n\nCommitting to a fair transition\n\nFor ENGIE, the transition to carbon neutrality by 2045 means taking into account the social impact of the energy transition. We must therefore integrate fair transition principles into all our projects at the local level and develop them in partnership with employees, unions, communities and suppliers. In accordance with the Paris Agreement, ENGIE is committed:\n\n- **to jobs**: processes and initiatives to stimulate employment opportunities, skills development and employee retention; measures to support employees affected by decarbonization;\n- **to local development**: initiatives aimed at creating economic value for regions and benefits for communities;\n- **to stakeholder inclusion**: promoting a fair transition in a co-constructive manner, by seeking solutions based on cooperation with governments and civil society.\n\nGuiding suppliers toward a responsible economy\n\nMindful of the need to prevent the risk of forced labor throughout its value chain, ENGIE is proactively working to identify suppliers who may be involved in human rights violations. In 2021, as part of the implementation of its due diligence policy, ENGIE set up a specific in-depth vigilance action plan to identify and manage the risks of forced labor practices in the Group\u2019s supply chains located in China.\nCUSTOMERS\n\n- Individual customers\n- Small business customers\n- Industrial customers\n- Key account customers\n- Trading\n\nDialogue procedures\n\n- Marketing and satisfaction studies\n- Measurement of Net Promoter Score (NPS)\n- Consumer panels\n- Responses to calls for tenders\n- Co-construction\n- Access space\n\n- Vigilance plan\n- Submission of tenders\n\n- Staff representative bodies at the European, national and local levels\n- \u201cENGIE & ME\u201d commitment survey\n\n- Calls for innovative projects\n- Support via the New Ventures investment fund\n- Vigilance plan\n- Submission of tenders\n\n- Participation in think tanks\n- Consultations\n- Partnerships\n- Corporate patronage\n\n- Roadshows\n- Interviews\n- Responses to evaluation questionnaires\n\n- Shareholders\u2019 Club\n- Events (visits to Group sites)\n- Meetings (face-to-face and online)\n- Annual General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting\n\n\u2022 140,000 suppliers\n  of which 250 preferred\n\u2022 75% of non-energy purchases in Europe\n\u2022 45% SME suppliers in France\n\n\u2022 101,504 employees\n\u2022 15,522 recruitments\n\u2022 4.9% apprentices in Europe\n\u2022 82.0% of employees trained\n\n\u2022 \u20ac38 m allocated to the Rassasseurs d\u2019Energies social impact fund\n\u2022 \u20ac180 m invested in the ENGIE New Ventures innovation fund\n\u2022 \u20ac138 m in R&D expenditure\n\n\u2022 Income tax paid: \u20ac0.6 m\n\u2022 Other taxes and duties: \u20ac1.5 bn\n\n\u2022 Financial net debt: \u20ac25.3 bn\n\u2022 Financial net debt/EBITDA: 2.4x\n\u2022 \u20ac14 bn in Green bonds issued since 2014, representing 43% of the Group\u2019s bonds\n\nI.e. 66% of 2021 Net recurring income. Group share (Proposal submitted to the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting of April 21, 2022)\nPROMOTING SUSTAINABLE AND RESPONSIBLE FINANCE\n\nIn line with its purpose, ENGIE relies on green finance to finance its activities in a sustainable and responsible manner while maximizing value creation for its shareholders.\n\nA very strong financial performance in 2021\nENGIE\u2019s financial performance was very strong in 2021: it achieved the top end of the NRIs guidance range. EBIT of \u20ac6.1 billion was up 42% organically, leveraging the favorable price environment and the Group\u2019s operational performance.\n\nENGIE met its targets in 2021 in an unprecedented energy environment, benefiting mainly from the strength of its integrated model. High levels of asset availability enabled the Group to use its flexible production capacity in a tight market. The right mix of contractual positions and activities, along with a strong balance sheet and liquidity, also helped it actively and effectively manage all exposures to benefit the Group and its customers.\n\nOut of \u20ac8.0 billion in total investments, growth investments stood at \u20ac4.4 billion, of which more than 90% related to the strategic priorities.\n\nSharing performance with shareholders\nThe Group reiterated its policy of basing its dividend on a payout ratio of 65% to 75% of net recurring income, Group share. It also introduced a floor dividend of \u20ac0.65 per share for 2021-2023.\n\nFor 2021, the Board of Directors thus proposed a payout of 66% of net recurring income, Group share, i.e. a dividend of \u20ac0.85 per share. This proposal will be submitted to the shareholders for approval at the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting on April 21, 2022. Since 2014, the Group has rewarded shareholders for their loyalty with an increased minimum dividend of +10%.\n\nEligible activities in 2021 under the EU Taxonomy\nThe Group\u2019s eligibility rates for the European taxonomy conceal very different rates depending on the activity. While the activities of the Renewables and Energy Solutions GBUs are fully or overwhelmingly eligible, those of the Thermal Generation and Energy Supply GBU and of the Networks GBU are only marginally eligible. However, the latter two will gradually become eligible as they convert to renewable gas. The remaining activities (GEMS and Nuclear) are, in principle, not covered. Capex for 2021 (growth and maintenance) was 48% eligible but growth capex was 78% eligible in 2021, confirming the announcement made in 2020.\n\nPierre-Fran\u00e7ois Riolacci\nExecutive Vice President in charge of Finance, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Purchasing\n\nENGIE is a major economic player and must practice responsible and sustainable finance. This is reflected in the rigorous management of its financing and debt capacities, but also in the selection of growth investments that contribute to the necessary energy transition towards a decarbonized world. In 2021, ENGIE invested more than \u20ac4 billion in growth capex, of which more than 90% related to the strategic priorities and nearly 80% aligned with the EU taxonomy. These investments were financed in particular by green bonds on the market in which ENGIE remains a key player with over 14 billion issued since 2014. In addition to this financing, ENGIE is a responsible company that supports its millions of customers through its decarbonized offers and efficiency solutions. At a time when prices are rising sharply, ENGIE is helping its individual customers by implementing the government\u2019s measures to freeze regulated rates in France and welcoming the customers of defaulting suppliers thanks to responsible pricing.\nGreen finance at the service of economic performance\n\nGreen bonds are financial tools that are used to finance the development of renewable energy projects or projects related to energy efficiency. ENGIE is currently the leading corporate issuer, having issued a total of more than \u20ac14 billion since 2014. In 2021, half the bonds issued by the Group were green bonds. These tools contribute to ENGIE\u2019s transformation towards low-carbon assets and energy services. Each time a green bond is allocated, the Group publishes an impact report to calculate the CO\u2082 emissions that have been avoided or reduced. The main projects financed by the Green Bond issuance of October 2021 should contribute to avoiding the emission of at least 3.43 million tons of CO\u2082 eq per year.\n\nA pacesetting financing structure\n\nEngaged in a decarbonization pathway, Chile has committed to becoming a net zero emission country by 2050. ENGIE is helping with its transition by activating several levers. The Group and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) have therefore developed a pilot financing structure that will be used to monetize the cost of decarbonization. It consists of a loan whose costs are reduced by a carbon price determined by a tailored methodology established by the IDB. This initiative could be replicated in the future by other Group subsidiaries.\n\nThis funding approach will help accelerate the transition by activating several levers: ending coal-based electricity production by 2025 (with the shutdown of plants and the conversion of the more recent plants to gas and biomass); developing 2 GW of renewable capacities; and setting up pilot projects in favor of renewable hydrogen. The full plan will enable ENGIE to reduce CO\u2082 emissions from its energy production activities in Chile by 80% by 2026. The plan provides for an investment of \u20ac1.5 billion by 2025.\nA COLLECTIVE COMMITMENT TO THE TRANSITION\n\nENGIE is committed to creating safe and fulfilling working conditions for all of its employees so as to rally an expert and committed community round the implementation of its purpose and its zero-carbon transition strategy.\n\nStaying tough on safety\n\nOccupational health and safety is ENGIE\u2019s first priority. It takes precedence over all other considerations for all people working for the Group, whether employees, temporary workers, subcontractors or interns. ENGIE has a policy of excellence to ensure the best possible working conditions all over the world. The Group\u2019s health and safety policy aims to make each individual, whether executive, manager or employee, a committed player in health and safety.\n\nIn line with the 2016-2020 action plan, which significantly reduced the frequency rate in each of its businesses, the Group has drawn up a health and safety action plan for 2021-2025, structured along three lines \u2013 No life at risk, No mind at risk, No asset at risk \u2013 and completed by two transversal levers:\n\n| NO LIFE AT RISK | NO MIND AT RISK | NO ASSET AT RISK |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Prevention of risks directly related to the performance of operations. | Prevention of risks related to the context in which activities are carried out, development of quality of life at work and prevention of psychosocial risks | Prevention of risks related to industrial processes |\n\nPriority actions\n\n- Reinforce the commitment of managers in health and safety management\n- Continue to deploy levers to prevent serious and fatal accidents\n- Develop the ability to identify risks\n- Set up a support plan for our subcontractors\n\nPriority actions\n\n- Reinforce the managerial dimension of quality of life at work\n- Understand the impact of physical and psychological health on safety at work\n- Identify and control risks related to the adaptations and variability of organizations\n- Identify and control risks related to the \u2018variability of persons\u2019\n\nPriority actions\n\n- Reinforce shared industrial safety management standards\n- Exercise particular vigilance regarding the industrial risks generated by our new activities and by newly integrated entities\n- Develop systematic sharing of feedback and best practices\n\n2 TRANSVERSAL LEVERS\n\nDigital\n\nto standardize and speed up the implementation of priority actions\n\nCommunication\n\nto strengthen the health and safety culture and the commitment of each individual\n\nThe Group suffered a particularly tragic 2021. While the number of lost time injuries continued to fall, we were deeply saddened by 16 deaths related to our activities: 4 employees and 12 subcontractors. Management responded swiftly and decided to implement a targeted and enhanced action program, focused on improving the safety culture, managers\u2019 leadership in this critical area, and everyone\u2019s commitment to and vigilance in protecting their own lives and the lives of others. Several key actions were rolled out, including:\n\n- the convening of a one-hour \u201csafety stand down\u201d for all employees, a special time for discussing safety within the teams;\n- a comprehensive assessment by a consulting firm specializing in health and safety culture for employees and subcontractors;\n- a supplemental action plan to ensure subcontractor safety;\n- the strengthening of the Group\u2019s safety, quality assurance and quality control standards.\nHR: a lever for the Group\u2019s transformation\n\nThe Human Resources strategy helps breathe life into ENGIE\u2019s purpose: stepping up the move towards a carbon-neutral economy. In that regard, the HR department supports the organizational transformation by providing concrete answers on three strategic objectives.\n\n1. Attracting and retaining talent\n\nENGIE aims to attract and retain all its talent through:\n- a strong, unifying and meaningful corporate culture;\n- varied career paths in France and abroad; and\n- a strong, attractive and consistent employer brand and promise in line with the Group\u2019s purpose and strategy.\n\nIn a global context marked by tensions in the job market, particularly with regard to technical and female profiles, the Group is pursuing a differentiated recruitment strategy, placing candidate experience at the heart of the recruitment process, to better serve the professions and the business.\n\nInternally, ENGIE once again conducted its employee engagement survey, ENGIE&Me. In 2021, the results showed a strong overall engagement level (up 1 point from 2020 to 83%), despite the disposal of EQUANS and the Group\u2019s fundamental transformation.\n\nIn addition, our employees responded favorably when asked about their confidence in the Group\u2019s vision and strategy (+2 points) and in leadership for the future (+5 points).\n\nENGIE has one goal for 2022: to build trust among and unite its employees in order to increase their engagement.\n\n2. Encouraging employee development\n\nDeveloping employee skills and employability is a key focus for the competitiveness and performance of an industrial group like ENGIE.\n\nTo ensure the successful roll-out of its strategy, ENGIE offers numerous learning opportunities and innovative training methods:\n- The Learning Festivals, which are five-day virtual pop-up campuses that bring together the Group\u2019s managers to strengthen their distinctive skills and their knowledge. This initiative helps to reinforce a sense of belonging to the Group and to develop a common culture through sharing and networking;\n- Engaging employees and encouraging their development, at all levels, to help them understand and take ownership of ENGIE\u2019s strategy, that is the objective of the Sustainability Academy, which provides numerous opportunities to discuss corporate sustainability internally and to learn from our experts, particularly through two training programs on corporate sustainability issues and how to incorporate them into our relationships with stakeholders and partners.\n\nTo go even further, ENGIE has stepped up the roll-out of the SkillLib program: an internal skills marketplace that gives managers a flexible way to access the skills they need in-house, while encouraging employees to develop new skills and fulfill their ambitions. In 2021, SkillLib was awarded the \u201cHR Innovation Prize\u201d by Victoires des Leaders du Capital Humain.\n\n3. Creating an inclusive environment\n\nFor ENGIE, diversity, professional equality and inclusion are drivers of innovation and performance.\n\nIn 2021, ENGIE therefore ramped up its efforts to promote the equal treatment of employees with the launch of the \u201cFriends\u201d network and the publication of a new global \u201cUnderstand each other to better act together\u201d guide.\n\nAt the European level, ENGIE strengthened its actions and its commitment by renewing its support for the European \u201cEmbrace Difference\u201d pledge and reiterating its adoption of the Women\u2019s Empowerment Principles defined by the UN (as from 2019).\n\nENGIE aims to achieve gender parity in management and is rolling out its international Fifty-Fifty program, which takes a systematic approach to creating the right conditions to meet this goal.\n\nENGIE has achieved excellent results and, in 2021, was recognized as one of the top companies in France and Europe:\n- 7th out of 120 companies in the SBF in the ranking of female representation in governance bodies, compiled by the French Ministry for Gender Equality;\n- 47th out of 668 European companies evaluated in the European \u201cGender Diversity Index.\u201d\n\nAn ambitious and dynamic social dialogue\n\nENGIE believes that social dialogue and negotiation are the pillars of social cohesion, which is essential to its transformation and performance. At the beginning of 2022, the Group signed a new global agreement that provides a common set of rights to all employees worldwide, especially with regard to social protection, sustainable employment and diversity. This agreement also creates a platform for global social dialogue by convening an annual Global Forum, with trade union federation representatives and ENGIE employees, the first edition of which will be held in the second half of 2022.\n\nOn the social front, the pandemic led to the acceleration of the ENGIE Care global social protection program. In 2020, ENGIE deployed the first part of this program in all its entities, enabling all Group employees to benefit from minimum health coverage in the event of hospitalization and a minimum capital sum in the event of death. The ENGIE Care program also aims, by 2024, to provide full pay for at least 14 weeks of maternity leave and at least four weeks of paternity leave for all its employees worldwide.\n\nQuality social dialogue is essential to the success of the company, as demonstrated by the EQUANS disposal process, which concluded with the signing of a protocol between ENGIE and the European Works Council (EWC). The potential investors presented their industrial and social projects to the EWC secretariat, which was followed by a comparative analysis of the proposals.\n\nJean-S\u00e9bastien Blanc\nExecutive Vice President in charge of Human Resources\n\nThe men and women of ENGIE are driven by our purpose: to take action and meet the environmental and societal challenges that are disrupting our organizations and our businesses, but that are also creating opportunities. Now more than ever, the HR department must work to promote the Group\u2019s business performance and growth, while supporting its transformation as an industrial player.\nIn accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF code and the best governance standards, ENGIE relies on experienced governance that supports its sustainable and responsible value creation.\nA BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nDRIVING THE GROUP\u2019S STRATEGY\n\nENGIE is managed by a team of 14 Directors with varied expertise whose mission, in terms of strategy, is to define the Group\u2019s orientations and ensure their implementation. To ensure that ENGIE\u2019s actions are consistent with its purpose, the Board of Directors takes into account the expectations of its stakeholders in order to meet the challenges that are transforming the energy sector.\n\nA Board that closely monitors the Group\u2019s challenges\n\nThe Group offers all new directors personalized training and regularly organizes specific training or information sessions. In 2021, the Directors benefited from two training sessions on the decommissioning of nuclear power plants in Belgium and on Global Energy Management (GEM) activities. Each year, the members of the Board meet at a strategic planning seminar during which they discuss sector developments and the expectations of the Group\u2019s stakeholders. The 2021 seminar provided an opportunity to review progress on the implementation of the strategy and to discuss the future of gas networks, the Group\u2019s ambitions in international electricity networks and the Group\u2019s research and innovation model. ENGIE is in regular dialogue with its shareholders, main institutional investors and proxy advisors as part of governance roadshows and at other times. This dialogue enables the Chairman of the Board to explain the Group\u2019s strategic orientations and discuss their expectations.\n\nComplementary expertise\n\nThe Board\u2019s objective is to ensure that its members are aligned with ENGIE\u2019s activities, challenges and strategic orientations, thereby contributing to the quality of the decisions taken. In 2022, the Board of Directors proposed strengthening its societal and environmental responsibility and its knowledge of renewable energy by appointing Marie-Claire Daveu. When this proposed appointment is finalized at the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting of April 21, 2022, the Board of Directors* will comprise 15 members, 64% independent members, 55% women and four nationalities (Australian, British, Canadian and French). ENGIE also ensures that the individual competencies of its directors are wide-ranging and complementary. The page below presents the 3 key skills of each director out of the 12 competencies selected.\n\nMajor work carried out in 2021\n\nIn 2021, members of the Board of Directors held discussions on the following topics in particular:\n\n- The Group\u2019s strategic orientations (repositioning of ENGIE, continued geographic refocusing, roll-out of the new organization, full phase-out of nuclear power by 2025**, etc.),\n- Investments and asset sales (process of sale of EQUANS, sale of interests in ENGIE EPS SA, ENDEL and GTT, sale of 11.5% in GRTgaz, acquisition in partnership with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances of Eolia, one of the largest renewable energy producers in Spain),\n- Finance and audit,\n- Governance (takeaways from the dialogue between the Chairman and shareholders, investors and proxy advisors, assessment of the functioning of the Board, etc.),\n- CSR (CSR targets, climate strategy and net zero commitment, matching of investments with the Group\u2019s CSR criteria, professional and salary equity policy, etc.).\n\n* In accordance with legal provisions and the applicable Afep-Medef Code, the four directors representing employees or employee shareholders are not taken into account when calculating the ratio of independent directors for the Board of Directors and its Committees or when calculating the ratio of women to men on the Board of Directors.\n\n** It should be noted that due to the global context, the Belgian government decided in March 2022 to enter into negotiations with ENGIE to extend the operation of the two most recent reactors until 2035.\nJean-Pierre Clamadieu (I)  \nChairman of the Board of Directors  \n\u2022 Seniority on the Board: 3 years  \n\u2022 Number of offices held: 2  \n\u2022 Attendance rate at meetings in 2021: 100%\n\nCatherine MacGregor  \nChief Executive Officer and Director  \n\u2022 Appointed on May 20, 2021  \n\u2022 No offices held  \n\u2022 Attendance rate at meetings in 2021: 100%\n\nFabrice Br\u00e9gier (I)  \n\u2022 Seniority on the Board: 5 years  \n\u2022 Number of offices held: 1  \n\u2022 Attendance rate at meetings in 2021: 100%\n\nFran\u00e7oise Malrieu (I)  \n\u2022 Seniority on the Board: 10 years  \n\u2022 No offices held  \n\u2022 Attendance rate at meetings in 2021: 100%\n\nRoss McInnes (I)  \n\u2022 Seniority on the Board: 3 years  \n\u2022 Number of offices held: 2  \n\u2022 Attendance rate at meetings in 2021: 100%\n\nMarie-Jos\u00e9 Nadeau (I)  \n\u2022 Seniority on the Board: 6 years  \n\u2022 No offices held  \n\u2022 Attendance rate at meetings in 2021: 100%\n\nLord Peter Ricketts of Shortlands (I)  \n\u2022 Seniority on the Board: 5 years  \n\u2022 No offices held  \n\u2022 Attendance rate at meetings in 2021: 100%\n\nSt\u00e9phanie Besnier  \n\u2022 Appointed on May 19, 2021  \n\u2022 Number of offices held: 2  \n\u2022 Attendance rate at meetings in 2021: 100%\n\nPatrice Durand  \n\u2022 Seniority on the Board: 5 years  \n\u2022 No offices held  \n\u2022 Attendance rate at meetings in 2021: 100%\n\nMari-No\u00eblle J\u00e9go-Laveissi\u00e8re  \n\u2022 Seniority on the Board: 6 years  \n\u2022 Number of offices held: 1  \n\u2022 Attendance rate at meetings in 2021: 100%\n\nChristophe Agogu\u00e9 (I)  \n\u2022 Seniority on the Board: 3 years  \n\u2022 No offices held  \n\u2022 Attendance rate at meetings in 2021: 100%\n\nAlain Beullier (I)  \n\u2022 Seniority on the Board: 13 years  \n\u2022 No offices held  \n\u2022 Attendance rate at meetings in 2021: 100%\n\nPhilippe Lepage  \n\u2022 Seniority on the Board: 7 years  \n\u2022 No offices held  \n\u2022 Attendance rate at meetings in 2021: 100%\n\nJacinthe Delage  \n\u2022 Elected at the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting of April 21, 2022  \n\u2022 No offices held  \n\u2022 Attendance rate at meetings in 2021: 100%\n\n* Subject to the vote by the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting of April 21, 2022\n\n1 In years elapsed  \n2 At February 14, 2022, in listed companies outside ENGIE  \n3 Two new directors representing the employees and elected by them were appointed at the end of the General Meeting, Ms. Magali Viot and Mr. Yoan Kosnar, replacing Mr. Lepage and Mr. Beullier, the term of Mr. Agogu\u00e9 was renewed.\n\n* Subject to the vote by the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting of April 21, 2022\n\n55%*  \nWOMEN ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n13 MEETINGS IN 2021\n\n100% PARTICIPATION RATE AT BOARD OF DIRECTORS\u2019 MEETINGS\n\nA LONG-TERM VISION\nBOARD COMMITTEES\n\nThe Board of Directors is supported in its missions by four standing Committees with complementary expertise.

It focused on priority risks, such as nuclear risk, cybersecurity risk or the industrial risks associated with certain major projects. It held several joint meetings with the Strategy, Investment and Technology Committee, mainly to review the business plan, the valuation of EQUANS, and the complete exit from nuclear power in 2025.\u201d\n\nMarie-Jos\u00e9 Nadeau, Committee Chair\n\n**Most represented competencies**\n- Finance\n- Administration of large companies\n\n**Attendance rate**\n- 100%\n\n**Independence rate**\n- 75%\n\n**3 women**\n- Marie-Jos\u00e9 Nadeau\n- St\u00e9phanie Besnier\n- Fran\u00e7oise Malrieu\n\n**2 men**\n- Christophe Agogu\u00e9\n- Ross McInnes\n\n**6 meetings**\n+ 5 joint meetings with the SITC\n\n**STRATEGY, INVESTMENT AND TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE**\n\n**MISSIONS**\nGives its opinion on major strategic directions, in particular for the strategic plan.

Ensures that the Group takes into account CSR issues and long-term perspectives.\n\nMAIN WORK IN 2021\n\u201cThe EESDC prepared the Board decisions on the adoption of a carbon neutrality target by 2045 covering not only Scopes 1 and 2 emissions but also Scope 3 emissions, moving from a 2\u00b0C trajectory to a \u201cwell below 2\u00b0C\u201d trajectory.\u201d It also examined the planned consultation with shareholders on the climate transition strategy. This resulted in the submission of a specific \u201cSay on climate\u201d resolution to our 2022 General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting. Lastly, the Committee held several special meetings in response to the high number of fatal accidents among Group employees and subcontractors in order to examine each of these accidents and ensure that the necessary measures would be taken.\u201d\nRoss McInnes, Committee Chair\nA GENERAL MANAGEMENT\nSTEERING THE TRANSFORMATION\n\nThe drawing up of ENGIE\u2019s strategy and the operational follow-up of its implementation are overseen by two executive bodies: the Executive Committee and the Operational Management Committee (OP\u2019COM).\n\nTwo complementary management levels\n\n**EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE**\n\n- **MEMBERS**\n  - Chief Executive Officer\n  - Executive Vice Presidents\n\n- **COMPOSITION**\n  - 11 members\n  - 3 women (27%)\n  - 2 nationalities\n\n- **MISSIONS**\n  - Makes strategic decisions in line with the guidelines set by the Board of Directors\n  - Develops the long-term vision\n  - Ensures that short-term objectives are met\n\n**Operational Management Committee (OP\u2019COM)**\n\n- **MEMBERS**\n  - Chief Executive Officer\n  - Executive Vice Presidents\n  - Entity CEOs\n  - Directors of Global Business Units, regions and main countries\n  - Heads of main functional departments\n\n- **COMPOSITION**\n  - 54 members\n  - 14 women (25.9%)\n  - 12 nationalities\n\n- **MISSIONS**\n  - Implements ENGIE\u2019s strategic decisions\n  - Carries the Group\u2019s transformation as close as possible to the regions\nA compensation policy that promotes sustainable performance\n\nThe Group has a compensation policy that is personalized, fair and competitive for all and which reflects the performance and level of responsibility of each person. Compensation of ENGIE\u2019s senior managers is set according to strict quantitative and qualitative performance criteria, which reflect the implementation of the strategy. Each year, the compensation policy for managers and corporate officers is reviewed by the Board of Directors, based on the recommendation of the Appointments, Compensation and Governance Committee. It is subject to the approval of the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting.\n\nIn 2021, the Chairman\u2019s compensation amounted to a fixed fee of \u20ac0.45 million. The ratio of the compensation for each corporate officer to the average compensation of ENGIE\u2019s employees in France was 9.3x for the Chairman and 54x for the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nIn 2022, three changes will be made to the Chief Executive Officer\u2019s compensation: performance units will be replaced by performance shares; a fourth CSR criterion will be introduced for the annual variable component, relating to the recruitment of 35% women managers; and the occupational accident frequency rate criterion will be replaced by a set of three indicators: frequency rate, severity rate and number of fatal accidents. Senior managers\u2019 variable compensation is structured around the same model as that of the Chief Executive Officer.\nA TRANSVERSAL GOVERNANCE OF CLIMATE CHALLENGES\n\nENGIE relies on a specific governance of climate issues in order to implement its purpose: acting to accelerate the transition to a carbon-neutral economy and achieving its goal of Net Zero Carbon by 2045. It not only includes specific responsibilities for each body but also the integration of climate-related issues into the Group\u2019s investment and planning processes.\n\nClimate governance \u2013 Board responsibilities\n\n**BOARD OF DIRECTORS**\nSets the climate strategy and associated objectives\nEnsures that the climate strategy is at the heart of the overall strategy of the company, in accordance with the corporate purpose\n\n**Ethics, Environment and Sustainable Development Committee**\nReviews the Group\u2019s climate objectives, their configuration (ambition, definition, scope, deadlines and level of certification) and the monitoring of their implementation\nExamines the risks and opportunities of climate change\n\n**Audit Committee**\nIdentifies priority risks including climate risk\nReviews financial guidance assumptions, including those related to climate\nMonitors the accounting impact of exceptional weather events\nExamines the adequacy of insurance coverage of risks (including climate risk)\n\n**Strategy, Investment and Technology Committee**\nIntegrates the Group\u2019s climate issues and climate objectives in its investment decision process\n\n**Appointments, Compensation and Governance Committee**\nMakes Remuneration of the CEO and the beneficiaries of performance shares conditional on specific climate objective\nLeads the annual Board evaluation, in particular on the consideration of climate issues\n\nClimate governance \u2013 Executive responsibilities\n\n**EXCOM**\nImplements the group\u2019s climate strategy / Proposes the group\u2019s climate policy to the Board / Makes arbitrages on climate trajectory between GBUs\nSponsors each of the 2030 CSR objectives (out of which 6 climate objectives)\n\n**Executive VP**\nin charge of Corporate Secretariat, Strategy, Research & Innovation and Communication\n\n**Executive VPs**\nin charge of GBUs (Renewables, Networks, Energy Solutions, Thermal & Supply)\n\n**Executive VP**\nin charge of Finance, Corporate Social Responsibility and Procurement\n\n**Strategy Department**\nDefines carbon price trajectories\nReviews energy market outlooks and demand trends\n\n**Global business Units / entities**\nEnsure the operationalisation of the climate strategy (investments and divestments, new products, projects...)\nDeliver projects and performance in line with the climate trajectories (CO2 yearly budget allocated by the ExCom)\n\n**Finance Department**\nEnsures investment decisions are consistent with the Group\u2019s climate commitments through their compliance with CO2 budgets and analysis including carbon pricing\n\n**CSR Department**\nLeads climate reporting (including TCFD)\nCoordinates the implementation of the climate strategy and its compliance with SBT objectives and climate adaptation plan\n\n**Ethics & Compliance Department**\nLeads the group\u2019s vigilance plan including climate issues\nA GLOBAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY\n\nThe diversity of its activities and locations exposes the Group to various risks (see p.16). To limit their occurrence, minimize their impact and anticipate them, ENGIE has a global risk management policy.\n\nThis policy lays out ENGIE\u2019s ambition to \u201ccontrol its risks in order to ensure its performance\u201d and advocates taking risks that are legally reasonable, acceptable to the public and economically bearable. The Group applies its global risk management system in the activities and entities it controls, in compliance with the governance rules applicable to each entity. The annual risk assessment process is organized as follows:\n\nA robust and scalable crisis management system\n\nIn order to deal effectively with the occurrence of all types of crises, ENGIE has set up a whistle-blowing and alert system based on the reporting and analysis of major incidents and the establishment of a decision-making process to manage the crisis at the appropriate level. This system was revised following the implementation of the Group\u2019s organization into Global Business Units (GBUs) on July 1, 2021.\n\nThe Covid-19 crisis demonstrated the Group\u2019s ability to anticipate events. It came up with quick and effective responses to the problems created by the transnational nature of the crisis. Throughout the pandemic, we ensured the protection of personnel and sites, as well as the safety of the supply chain.\n\nA vigilance plan managed at the highest level\n\nThe Group has a broad range of measures in place to prevent violations of human rights, fundamental freedoms, the environment and human health and safety in connection with its activities and those of its subsidiaries. The vigilance plan is deployed by a specific interdepartmental committee which reports annually to the Ethics, Environment and Sustainable Development Committee of the Board of Directors on its implementation. In 2021, ENGIE continued its action to prevent, wherever possible, the risks identified throughout its value chain.\n\nFor more information: ENGIE vigilance plan \u2022 Summary of the vigilance plan in the Universal Registration Document \u2022 Responsible Purchasing policy\nPursuant to your request and in our capacity as Statutory Auditors of ENGIE (the \"Company\"), we performed a review in the aim of providing limited and reasonable assurance on a selection of environmental and social indicators identified by the symbols \u25a0 and \u25a1 respectively (the \"Information\") in the 2022 integrated report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nConclusion\nReasonable assurance\nIn our opinion, the Information selected by the Company and identified by the sign \u25a0 in the 2022 integrated report, has been prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the criteria used by the company (hereinafter the \"Reporting Criteria\").\n\nLimited assurance\nBased on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Information selected by the Company and identified by sign \u25a1 in the 2022 integrated report, has been prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.\n\nResponsibility of the Company\nThe Information has been prepared under the responsibility of ENGIE executive management, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria for social and environmental reporting data, available upon request at the Company\u2019s headquarters from the Group Environmental and Social Responsibility Department, the Group Health and Safety Department and the Group Human Resources Department.\n\nApplicable regulatory provisions and professional\nThe work described below was performed in accordance with the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes) relating to this engagement and with the international standard ISAE 3000 (revised).\n\nIndependence and quality control\nOur independence is defined by regulatory texts, the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) and the requirements of the French Commercial Code.
