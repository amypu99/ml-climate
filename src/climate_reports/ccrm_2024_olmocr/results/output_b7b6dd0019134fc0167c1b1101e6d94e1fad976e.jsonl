Tesco customers and colleagues are also encouraged to nominate local good causes to be supported.\n\nTesco customers in each store across the UK are given a blue token with their shopping to vote for the projects they think most deserve funding.\n\nSince the programme launched in 2016 Tesco Community Grants has awarded \u00a3101,881,339 in grant funding to 50,880 community projects, with grant awards decided by 738,402,011 votes cast by Tesco customers in stores across the UK.\u00b9\n\nAbout Groundwork\n\nTesco Community Grants is managed by Groundwork, working in partnership with greenspace scotland. Groundwork is a charity working locally and nationally to transform lives in the UK\u2019s most disadvantaged communities.\n\nWe are passionate about creating a future where every neighbourhood is vibrant and green, every community is strong and able to shape its own destiny, and no-one is held back by their background or circumstances.\n\n\u00b9All figures correct as of October 2022.\nWe\u2019re proud to say that at Tesco, we\u2019re right at the heart of communities. That\u2019s because at every one of our stores up and down the UK, we are giving every customer and every one of our 300,000 colleagues, the chance to play their part and respond to local need in their communities. And we\u2019ve been doing so in partnership with and alongside Groundwork, to provide financial grant support for 50,000 projects who are working hard to make a difference to local people\u2019s lives, since 2016.\n\nThrough the best of times we\u2019ve responded in celebration of milestone events, like our special centenary rounds which saw more than \u00a33.3m awarded to groups across the country. We\u2019ve helped outdoor spaces thrive, grown gardens, vegetables, flowers and fruit and we\u2019ve inspired all ages to sing, dance, play music together and perform.\n\nAnd more recently through some very difficult times we\u2019ve helped get what\u2019s needed most to families through funding for food, mental health support, lifesaving equipment and specialist resources. During the Covid pandemic for example, when community groups were a lifeline of support but were in crisis themselves, and now, as we face into the huge challenges of cost of living, supporting community groups who constantly worry if they will run out of money just keeping the lights on.\n\nWe\u2019ve helped raise awareness of efforts to combat knife crime in London, supported veterans through charities based in our garrison towns and kept kids happy and active through sport. We\u2019ve helped fund Pride events from Swansea to the Isle of Wight, and awarded grants to groups working to eradicate homelessness in Greater Manchester.\n\nAll of this and so much more has been possible thanks to the support of our customers who vote for the causes that matter to them and to Groundwork for helping us to understand better what\u2019s important to the local communities in which we serve.\n\nAs a result, we\u2019ve been able to respond when it matters and to understand the relevant issues at heart, providing, through our tried and tested blue token scheme, access, reassurance and solutions for thousands of people nationwide.\n\nAt Tesco, everyone is welcome. We hope our Tesco and Groundwork Impact Report highlights this, the enormous breadth, diversity and opportunities we have supported and the positive difference we\u2019re helping to make in our communities every day.\n\nJason Tarry\nChief Executive, Tesco UK\nIt seems we\u2019re living through an age of crisis. As a country we\u2019ve emerged from a global pandemic straight into a cost of living crunch while all around us the impacts of climate change are becoming more real and more severe. Our communities are being buffeted by forces beyond their control with the greatest stress being felt by those with least choice in society.\n\nAt the same time, however, we see time and time again how collective action in our local communities can make a difference to the way people think, feel and act about the challenges they face. Neighbourhood groups, schools and community hubs provided a lifeline during lockdowns, local voluntary organisations are at the forefront of tackling food and fuel poverty, and there is a groundswell of environmental activism that gives us hope we can prevent the worst impacts of climate change and help nature recover.\n\nThat\u2019s why the Tesco Community Grants scheme is so timely and so important. It puts money directly into the hands of local people working to make a difference to the quality of life in their area. Some of the projects funded are literally life-saving \u2013 supporting vital health and care facilities \u2013 others are helping local communities have more say over what goes in their area through the running of community centres or local services. Many are simply giving us the chance to meet neighbours and share in the things that bring us joy in life \u2013 improving playgrounds and sports facilities, supporting local choirs or connecting us with nature.\n\nAt Groundwork we have over 40 years\u2019 experience of helping communities to change places and change lives \u2013 putting power in the hands of local people to make a practical difference to the issues that matter to them. We remain delighted to be working with Tesco to make this happen on such a scale.\n\nGraham Duxbury\nChief Executive, Groundwork UK\nTesco Community Grants was launched in England, Wales and Scotland in October 2016 as \u2018Bags of Help\u2019, utilising funds raised through the sale of Tesco\u2019s single use carrier bags and Bags for Life. It became an integral component of Tesco\u2019s community strategy and was relaunched in 2020 as Tesco Community Grants, now including Northern Ireland.\n\nHow it works\n\nSince its inception the programme has always had an emphasis on being led by local communities, from the application and nomination process, through to the way funding decisions get made. Applicants submit their ideas online with every application assessed against a set of eligibility criteria. Having been checked by Groundwork\u2019s expert grant management team, local grant panels including Tesco colleagues help identify a shortlist of successful applications. Three projects appear in the vote every quarter in each of Tesco\u2019s 656 \u2018store regions\u2019\u00b2. Customers get the final say through the blue token voting system with projects receiving up to \u00a31,500, \u00a31,000 or \u00a3500 based on the number of votes cast.\n\nApplicant groups are also supported by a network of \u2018Community Enablers\u2019 employed by Groundwork and greenspace scotland, who work in the heart of communities helping to raise awareness of the programme, supporting local groups with the application process and offering advice on how to deliver and promote successful projects.\n\nWhat\u2019s been delivered\n\n- **50,880** projects supported across the UK\n- **738,402,011** customer votes in Tesco stores\n- **\u00a3101,881,339** in grants awarded\n\nTesco Community Grants is a demand-led programme, meaning groups can apply for the projects and activities they want to deliver and customers can determine through their votes which groups receive most support. The programme has supported a huge variety of activities driven by local need and opportunity.\n\nThe following tables illustrates the breakdown of the number of grants awarded and total funding based on the core project focus between 2016 and 2022.\n\n\u00b2 The number and concentration of Tesco \u2018store regions\u2019 vary across UK regions and countries, which will be reflected in the amounts of grants and funding awarded in those areas.\nTesco Community Grants supports local groups and good causes in every part of the UK. Highlighting different projects in each of Tesco\u2019s 656 \u2018store regions\u2019 ensures grant panels are able to make recommendations informed by local knowledge and customers are able to vote for projects they recognise in their local area.\n\nThe following graphs illustrate the breakdown of the number of grants awarded and total funding provided by geographic region between 2016 and 2022.\n\n| Project focus                                      | No of grants awarded | Funding provided  |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| Arts and culture                                  | 1611                 | \u00a32,500,409        |\n| Building better community relationships           | 3599                 | \u00a36,123,605        |\n| Community activities in an outdoor space          | 1822                 | \u00a34,180,573        |\n| Covid 19 emergency support                        | 8049                 | \u00a34,024,500        |\n| Creating a better environment                     | 5160                 | \u00a317,260,217       |\n| Education, training or skills                     | 6540                 | \u00a311,187,705       |\n| Improving health and wellbeing                    | 15091                | \u00a330,396,315       |\n| Physical improvements to an outdoor space         | 3207                 | \u00a317,145,443       |\n| Sport                                             | 4077                 | \u00a37,127,781        |\n| Tackling food insecurity                          | 1724                 | \u00a31,934,791        |\n| **Total**                                         | **50880**            | **\u00a3101,881,339**  |\nGrants Awarded by Region (2016 - 2022)\n\n- East Midlands: 3,265\n- East of England: 5,627\n- Isle of Man: 76\n- London: 3,516\n- North East: 1,499\n- North West: 4,956\n- Northern Ireland*: 506\n- Scotland: 6,815\n- South East: 7,762\n- South West: 5,909\n- Wales: 3,643\n- West Midlands: 3,670\n- Yorkshire and the Humber: 3,363\n\nFunding Awarded by Region (2016 - 2022)\n\n- East Midlands: \u00a36,730,454\n- East of England: \u00a311,593,994\n- Isle of Man: \u00a3151,166\n- London: \u00a37,121,658\n- North East: \u00a32,977,569\n- North West: \u00a310,009,383\n- Northern Ireland*: \u00a3547,733\n- Scotland: \u00a313,345,657\n- South East: \u00a315,885,460\n- South West: \u00a311,857,035\n- Wales: \u00a37,160,948\n- West Midlands: \u00a37,231,304\n- Yorkshire and the Humber: \u00a37,268,978\n\n* Tesco Community Grants funding became available in Northern Ireland in 2020.\nResponding to need\n\nTesco Community Grants is a demand-led programme \u2013 providing funds to help communities act on the issues that matter to them. Over the course of the programme, feedback from local stores, stakeholders and communities has led to concentrations of activity on specific issues.\nFor sixteen weeks, the Hackney teenagers undertake weekly nursery visits, followed by a reflective classroom session with Power2 facilitators. As part of the scheme, the young people will mentor an assigned toddler with learning and play activities. For some participants, mentoring their assigned toddler is the first time anyone has ever looked up to them \u2013 an enormous boost to their self-esteem. Mentoring helps them improve self-confidence and resilience, which is known to reduce the risk of school exclusion and involvement in violent or criminal behaviour.\n\nCharlotte Schofield, income and engagement officer at Power2, said:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so grateful to Tesco for this funding. 76% of our beneficiaries at Power2 are based in London and from an ethnic minority background.\n\n\u201cWe will use this funding to extend our programme to help set the foundations for disadvantaged young people to have brighter futures - preventing problems like exclusion and involvement in knife crime before they occur.\n\n\u201cSocio-economic disadvantage is closely linked to poor wellbeing and engagement at school. Poor mental health and school exclusion have both been found to be risk-factors for grooming by gangs and involvement in knife crime.\n\n\u201cTeens and Toddlers can help through early intervention to improve young people\u2019s wellbeing.\u201d\n\n---\n\nKnife Crime\n\nIn London we helped draw attention to the work being done by local community groups to help combat knife crime, adding value to campaigns led by the Mayor and local authorities to tackle the issue. Although official statistics show the number of incidents declining from a peak of 15,600 in 2019/20, crime involving knives remains a significant concern for communities with young Londoners particularly concerned about safety. In total \u00a344,000 was awarded to 43 groups delivering projects to provide positive alternatives for young people drifting into gangs and tailored mentoring support in schools.\n\nPower2, London\n\nHackney teens at risk of grooming by gangs and involvement in knife crime were able to benefit from a peer-mentoring programme that looks to improve their school engagement and mental wellbeing.\n\nPower2 received \u00a31,000 from Tesco Community Grants scheme to fund its Teens and Toddlers initiative which will see young men aged 13-15 improve their school engagement and mental wellbeing through the experience of mentoring a toddler in a local nursery.\n\n---\n\n3 https://www.centreforlondon.org/news/young-people-crime/\nHomelessness\n\nIn Manchester we supported the launch of the Mayor\u2019s homelessness strategy, dedicating funds to projects that help people sleeping rough by providing food and emergency shelter. Research published by Shelter found that Manchester had the third highest rate of homelessness behind Luton and Brighton with one in 81 people in the city classed as being homeless in 2021.\n\nTo help address this issue 40 groups in Greater Manchester were awarded funds of just over \u00a3100,000 that helped support the creation of overnight \u2018people pods\u2019 and the provision of advice, support, guidance and outreach services in the city.\n\nThe Booth Centre, Manchester\n\nThe Booth Centre is a Manchester charity-run caf\u00e9 and wellbeing centre open five days a week, providing a nutritious meal for those experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness. The centre received a \u00a31,500 grant from Manchester Tesco shoppers.\n\nJenni Willows, head of fundraising at The Booth Centre, said: \u201cAt the Booth Centre, we know it\u2019s important to offer people the chance to come in and eat a free healthy breakfast and lunch in a sociable environment. We know that often this is the only food an individual will eat all day.\n\n\u201cAcross Greater Manchester, over 5,500 people are homeless, either living on the streets or in temporary accommodation. We are here for anyone who needs us. With support from Tesco, we were able to supply over 900 people with a nutritious hot meal in a warm, safe and friendly space.\u201d\n\nAs well as accessing meals at the Booth Centre, people can also join community projects including growing food in the centre\u2019s garden, which is then used in the kitchen. The charity also runs training placements in the kitchen to give people a head start towards food service and preparation employment.\n\nJenni continued: \u201cWe can help people improve their health and wellbeing through enjoying a substantial meal. Then, through welcoming people and getting to know each other, we can help people with all the support they need to move forward in their lives.\n\n\u201cAs such, we can help people leave behind food insecurity, poverty and homelessness forever. With many small, often volunteer-run groups facing rising costs, Tesco Community Grants are vital at the moment to help us keep going.\u201d\n\n4https://england.shelter.org.uk/media/press_release/274000_people_in_england_are_homeless_with_thousands_more_likely_to_lose_their_homes\nArmed Forces\n\nIn communities with a large military presence some of the challenges we heard about included the difficulty veterans face in finding work and the impact this can have on their mental health, with Ministry of Defence research\\(^5\\) suggesting 12.7% of UK Armed Forces personnel were seen in military healthcare for a mental health related reason in 2019/20.\n\nIn Scarborough, Plymouth and other \u2018garrison towns\u2019 we have responded to this by providing nearly \u00a3190,000 in grants to projects ranging from supporting local people in their recovery with alcohol and substance misuse to providing much-needed support to bereaved British Forces children who have suffered the loss of a parent.\n\nWithernsea Armed Forces and Veterans Breakfast Club, Scarborough\n\nA charity providing a safe environment and social breakfast club for veterans and serving members of HM Forces has received a \u00a3500 grant from Scarborough Tesco shoppers.\n\nWithernsea Armed Forces and Veterans Breakfast Club is a charity-run social gathering\n\nKevin Thomas Watson, secretary at Withernsea Armed Forces and Veterans Breakfast Club, said:\n\n\u201cVeterans of all ages and all arms of the services can feel isolated when in civvy street, missing the banter and camaraderie experienced whilst serving.\n\n\u201cWe provide a safe and welcoming environment for them to \u2018return to the tribe\u2019, where they can relax, feel safe, and enjoy general chat among like-minded people, and give back some of the feeling of belonging which they may have lost when leaving the services. They come to enjoy the three B\u2019s - Butty, Brew, and Banter. Too often those who serve, and have served in His Majesty\u2019s Forces can feel apart from society, and miss that special bond gained in the forces.\u201d\n\n\\(^5\\) https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/993208/20210617_MH_Annual_Report_2020-21.pdf\nScotty\u2019s Little Soldiers, Plymouth\n\nScotty\u2019s Little Soldiers, the Plymouth charity for bereaved British Forces children and young people, received \u00a31,500 from the Tesco Community Grant scheme after customers in local stores voted for the charity to support the Children of the Fallen project.\n\nScotty\u2019s Little Soldiers was founded by widow Nikki Scott in 2010, following the death of her husband, Corporal Lee Scott, in Afghanistan and after seeing the devastating impact on their two young children. The charity provides support and guidance to hundreds of bereaved military children and young people throughout their childhood.\n\nServices offered to Scotty\u2019s members include access to child bereavement support, guidance to parents and carers, personal education and learning assistance (including grants), and fun activities such as holiday respite breaks and group events. These are all designed to remind the children and young people supported by Scotty\u2019s that they are not alone.\n\nFounder Nikki Scott said: \u201cWe\u2019re really grateful to Tesco for this funding. Our mission is to provide relief from the effects of bereavement to young people who have experienced the death of a parent who served with the Armed Forces.\n\n\u201cWe want every bereaved Forces child to have access to the very best health and wellbeing support, outstanding development opportunities and the chance to smile again.\n\n\u201cWithout kind public assistance like this from organisations such as Tesco, we wouldn\u2019t be able to provide this much-needed support. It means so much to the children to know they are part of a supportive community that helps keep them connected to the military and that their parents\u2019 service and sacrifice have not been forgotten.\u201d\nFood Poverty\n\nFood poverty was the focus of a dedicated round of Tesco Community Grants funding in Glasgow, recognising the fact that the city has a well-developed community food network which is seen as an integral part of the Glasgow City Food Plan for 2030. \u00a320,000 was awarded to 14 groups in the city to support projects that support pop up food banks and provide healthy breakfasts for children.\n\nFood insecurity is also a key challenge in Birmingham \u2013 with 7% of the city\u2019s residents reported as needing to use food banks during lockdown. We have been able to award \u00a368,000 to 77 projects in the city that feed vulnerable families through life-saving food parcels and work with local schools to provide children at risk of hunger with a free, nutritious breakfast each school morning.\n\nhttps://www.local.gov.uk/case-studies/birmingham-city-council-food-system-strategy-2022-2030\nSt Mark\u2019s Primary School, Irvine\n\nSt Mark\u2019s Primary School received \u00a3500 to help it run a daily breakfast club, which aims to reduce the stress of the morning routine for families and children, offering them a healthy breakfast before school starts.\n\nEach child taking part in the breakfast club receives a healthy meal to help them kickstart their day, as well as an opportunity to enjoy further social interactions with their friends. The project was put on hold during the recent pandemic; however, the grant has supported the school in buying new equipment such as plates and tea towels, helping to re-establish the breakfast club, which sees between 80 to 100 children in attendance daily.\n\nClaire McKie, Principal Teacher, said: \u201cOur Breakfast Club helps to support children and families in alleviating the stress of morning routines, especially during this challenging time. We aim to ensure that every child can receive a healthy breakfast and a good start to their school day so that they\u2019re ready to focus, concentrate and learn as soon as the bell goes at 9am.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to thank all of the team at Tesco and the kind customers who voted for our cause and help us to relaunch these vital Breakfast Club sessions following the recent pandemic.\u201d\n5UP CIC, Birmingham\n\nYoung people from all backgrounds across Birmingham are receiving nutritious meals and support, helped by a grant from Tesco.\n\n5UP CIC received the funds from Tesco\u2019s Community Grant scheme after customers in local stores voted for the charity, to support the group\u2019s Keep Me Out of Trouble & Feed Me Project.\n\nThe group works with partners such as the West Midlands Police, Sandwell Police and Birmingham agencies to tackle socio-economic factors that affect communities throughout the Birmingham area.\n\nThe Tesco funding will be used to engage people with health and wellbeing programmes, crime reduction initiatives and mentoring programs. The group specifically supports children and young people from any ethnicity who may come from a disadvantaged background and be at a higher risk of gang involvement and knife crime.\n\nNathan Bendon, one of the founders of 5UP CIC, said: \u201cThanks to Tesco we are able to provide our participants with a healthy meal after each session. Families can often struggle to put three meals on the table each day, and this funding will allow us to feed the children while teaching them about nutrition and the importance of a healthy diet.\n\n\u201cOur project works with the police and this generous grant will allow us to help steer young people away from a life of crime and instead choose healthier, happier lives.\n\n\u201cThe young people we work with are from all different cultures and religions and our initiative encourages them to work together to learn about each other\u2019s cultures, ensuring that in and out of the gym these individuals\u2019 values are guided by a sense of respect and understanding.\u201d\nCelebrating Diversity\n\nIn many parts of the country funding from Tesco Community Grants has been used by local groups to support cohesion and celebrate diversity within our communities. The scheme has supported provision for refugees and asylum seekers, helped build bridges between generations and been used by groups to show their support for the LGBTQ+ community through events and activities linked to Pride Week.\n\nGIRES, Wales\n\nThe Gender Identity Research & Education Society (GIRES) \u2013 a charity whose mission is to work with and support the trans and gender diverse communities \u2013 was voted by customers in local stores to receive the \u00a31,000 grant from Tesco as part of its Community Grant scheme to support their project and ensure that trans and gender diverse people in Wales are treated equally and respectfully when they die.\n\nGIRES works in collaboration with other charities and groups with similar aims and goals to improve the environments in which trans and gender-diverse people live.\n\nSupported by over 300 individuals, GIRES offers a variety of services to ensure that the rights of trans and gender diverse people are upheld throughout their lives and afterwards.\n\nAsh Hayhurst, Being Ready Project Manager said: \u201cWe cannot thank Tesco enough for this funding. Our mission is to work with and collaborate with all who share in our beliefs and values to uphold the rights of trans and gender diverse communities.\n\n\u201cEveryone should be able to feel safe and comfortable in their own bodies and communities without fear of being treated differently and this should also be the case in death. No one should feel as though they must hide any part of themselves in order to receive adequate care and support.\u201d\nSupporting Sustainability\n\nAcross the country local charities and communities are driving action to combat the climate and nature emergencies. 16% of funds awarded through Tesco Community Grants have gone to projects focused on creating a better environment or improving an outdoor space. Many of the projects funded to support health and wellbeing also achieve their goals by helping people connect with nature. Projects funded range from local food and gardening initiatives to campaigns to reduce waste and promote re-use. We are also providing support and information to help all groups funded consider what more they can do to deliver their project in a way which maximises environmental sustainability.\nCOVID-19\n\nTesco Bags of Help responded to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic by setting up a new short-term fund to support local communities: the Tesco Covid-19 Emergency Response Fund. The fund provided a single payment award of \u00a3500 to organisations which are supporting vulnerable groups.\n\nThe fund was designed to support organisations that experienced one of the following:\n\n- Increased demand e.g. a holiday hunger club needing more resources to support children through the summer months, or a food bank needing an immediate donation to restock.\n- Disrupted services e.g. a local charity adapting its local lunch club into a delivery service, or a charity needing to set up a telephone service to support beneficiaries.\n- Need for new services e.g. a health focused charity requiring new IT equipment to set up a new online patient service, or a mental health charity developing a new service in response to new need.\n\nThe fund was launched on 1 April 2020 and at the time of the evaluation of the Covid-19 Emergency Response Fund 7,425 applications had been received, with a total of \u00a34,025,000 being awarded to 8,050 projects.\n\n7 As of 17 July 2020\nTo apply for a Tesco Community Grant visit:\nwww.tescocommunitygrants.org.uk\n\nReport published by Groundwork UK.\nwww.groundwork.org.uk\n\nGroundwork UK is the operating name of the Federation of Groundwork Trusts, a company limited by guarantee.\nCompany Registration Number: 1900511\nCharity Registration Number: 291558", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-04-09", "created": "2025-04-09", "metadata": {"Source-File": "climate_reports/ccrm_2024/tesco_2022.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.1.59", "pdf-total-pages": 20, "total-input-tokens": 32592, "total-output-tokens": 6605, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 83, 1], [83, 1352, 2], [1352, 1352, 3], [1352, 3763, 4], [3763, 5638, 5], [5638, 7825, 6], [7825, 9557, 7], [9557, 10344, 8], [10344, 10639, 9], [10639, 13112, 10], [13112, 15524, 11], [15524, 17413, 12], [17413, 19137, 13], [19137, 20023, 14], [20023, 21280, 15], [21280, 22929, 16], [22929, 24652, 17], [24652, 25361, 18], [25361, 26521, 19], [26521, 26836, 20]]}}
