It reaffirms our dual commitment to simultaneously achieve economic success and social progress, which has now been enshrined within our by-laws through our \u201cSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Mission\u201d status. We also focus on the sustainability issues that are central to our business, showing how they are connected to our operations and broader value chain. Our intention with this report is to be transparent, not only about how we are pursuing our sustainability objectives, but also, about the challenges we are currently facing in pursuing them.\n\nMETHODOLOGY AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe 2022 Integrated Annual Report was created by Danone\u2019s Sustainability Performance team, with the support and supervision of the relevant thematic expert teams, who were instrumental in ensuring its achievement, through data collection and key testimonies.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n5 INTRODUCTION BY OUR CEO\n7 DANONE AT A GLANCE\n9 OUR CATEGORIES\n11 RENEW DANONE\n12 DANONE IMPACT JOURNEY\n45 MATERIALITY\n51 GOVERNANCE\n55 SHAREHOLDING STRUCTURE\nINTRODUCTION STATEMENT FROM OUR CEO,\nANTOINE DE SAINT-AFFRIQUE\n\nDEAR READERS,\n\n2022 was a year like no other. In the midst of unprecedented external challenges, we:\n\n- launched a new strategy, Renew Danone\n- celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Dual Project and Antoine Riboud\u2019s Marseille speech\n- re-emphasized our commitment to healthier and more sustainable lifestyles through our sponsorship of the 2024 Olympic Games, and\n- set our sustainability priorities for the coming years, focusing on health, nature, and people and communities\n\nThese achievements have one common goal: to deliver on our mission of bringing health through foods to as many people as possible \u2013 health for today\u2019s generation, future generations, and for our planet.\n\nIf you look at the financial results, 2022 was indeed a solid year. Our 2022 net sales increased by 7.8% compared to 2021, on a like-for-like basis. We significantly increased investments in brands and core capabilities, after years of decline. We strengthened our competitive position in many countries such as the U.S., Japan, and China, and we made progress in making our portfolio more resilient and better performing. Finally, we showed disciplined capital allocation.\n\nBut 2022 wasn\u2019t just about financial performance. We further strengthened our plans to reduce our impact on the climate, and increase the preservation of planetary resources. We became one of the first companies with a Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) certified 1.5\u00b0C trajectory, including specific Food, Land, and Agriculture targets. In addition, we continued to push the frontier in regenerative agriculture, with a specific focus on regenerative dairy. Capitalizing on momentum from pilots in methane reduction, we developed absolute reduction targets for fresh milk, to achieve a 30% reduction in methane emissions by 2030 (announced in early 2023). Our leadership in environmental transparency on climate change, forests, and water security was once again recognized in 2022, with Danone achieving a Triple A CDP rating for the fourth year in a row.\n\nWe could not have achieved what we did in 2022 without the passion of our employees and their continued engagement. Moving forward, we believe that we have everything it takes to continue to be pioneers in sustainable value creation. We have a robust agenda to ensure long-term growth which is competitive, profitable and sustainable. Through our Impact Journey, which builds on Renew Danone and is rooted in our Dual Project and our mission, we aim to step up our positive impact on health, nature, and people and communities while driving performance.\n\nI hope you will enjoy reading more about our main achievements from 2022 and how we\u2019re creating sustainable value through products and innovation, and through our engagement with farmers, food tech/entrepreneurs, public organizations, NGOs/civil society, and Danone Communities.\n\nA HUGE THANK YOU, AGAIN, TO ALL OUR DANONERS, AS WELL AS OUR PARTNERS WORLDWIDE.\n\nANTOINE DE SAINT-AFFRIQUE\n\n\u201c2022 WASN\u2019T JUST ABOUT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. WE FURTHER STRENGTHENED OUR PLANS TO REDUCE OUR IMPACT ON THE CLIMATE\u201d\nDanone\u2019s mission is to bring \u201chealth through food to as many people as possible.\u201d This mission is rooted in our Dual Project, as it was defined in 1972 by the Group founder and then CEO Antoine Riboud during a landmark speech in Marseille. Today we have kept this ambition as part of Renew Danone to create both economic and societal value.\n\n**DELIVERING SUSTAINABLE GROWTH**\n\n**LEADING POSITIONS**\n\n**WORLDWIDE**\n\n- **#1** in fresh dairy products, in plant-based foods and beverages\n- **#2** in packaged waters and early-life nutrition\n- **#1** in adult nutrition\n\n**KEY FINANCIAL FIGURES**\n\n- **\u20ac27.7** BN +7.8% (1)\n- **12.2%** (-154 bps (2))\n- **\u20ac3.42** BN +3.6% (3)\n- **\u20ac2.1** BN\n- **2.5x**\n- **\u20ac2.00**\n\n**SALES BY GEOGRAPHIC ZONES**\n\n- **EUROPE**\n  - \u20ac8.8bn\n  - 34%\n  - 46%\n  - 20%\n  - 91%\n- **NORTH AMERICA** (3)\n  - \u20ac6.7bn\n  - 4%\n  - 6%\n  - 91%\n- **CHINA, NORTH ASIA & OCEANIA** (3)\n  - \u20ac3.4bn\n  - 10%\n  - 19%\n  - 71%\n- **REST OF THE WORLD**\n  - \u20ac8.7bn\n  - 29%\n  - 49%\n  - 21%\n\n**TOP 3 COUNTRIES IN TERMS OF SALES**\n\n- **U.S.A.**\n- **CHINA**\n- **FRANCE**\n\n**CONTINUING OUR PATH TOWARDS SOCI\u00c9T\u00c9 \u00c0 MISSION AND B CORP:**\n\n**SOCI\u00c9T\u00c9 \u00c0 MISSION SINCE 2020**\n\n- first French listed company to adopt the \u201cSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Mission\u201d status\n\n**74.2% DANONE\u2019S GLOBAL NET SALES covered by B Corp certification (vs. 62% in 2021)**\n\n**FOCUSING ON HEALTH**\n\n- **91% OF THE GROUP VOLUME SOLD IS FOCUSED ON HEALTHY CATEGORIES**\n\n**FOCUSING ON NATURE**\n\n- **VALIDATION BY THE SCIENCE-BASED TARGETS INITIATIVE OF DANONE\u2019S 1.5\u00b0C targets for scope 1, 2 and 3, including Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG)**\n\n**FOCUSING ON PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES**\n\n- **SCORE OF 86% FOR THE INCLUSION INDEX, measured through the Danone People Survey**\n\nIn 2022, we also continued our collaboration with several value chain partners, including farmers, entrepreneurs, consumers and communities, (see more in the following sections).\nOUR CATEGORIES\n\nESSENTIAL DAIRY AND PLANT-BASED PRODUCTS (EDP)\n\n- **POSITION:** IN 2022, DANONE WAS WORLDWIDE\n  - #1 IN DAIRY\n  - #1 IN PLANT-BASED\n\n- **IN ESSENTIAL DAIRY PRODUCTS, MORE THAN 60% OF DANONE\u2019S REVENUES COME FROM HIGH VALUE-ADDED FUNCTIONAL SEGMENTS SUCH AS IMMUNITY, GUT HEALTH, INDULGENCE, OR PERFORMANCE.**\n  For example, the high-protein platform, spearheaded by brands like YoPRO, launched only a few years ago, now has sales exceeding \u20ac500M in 2022.\n\n- **IN PLANT-BASED, DANONE IS A LEADER WITHIN A CATEGORY THAT CONTINUES TO GROW GLOBALLY, DRIVEN BY THE RISE OF FLEXITARIANISM.**\n  The Group is notably present in Europe (with Alpro) and North America (with Silk), with a portfolio spanning across all key segments, from the established Beverages segment (ingredient-based with Almond or Oat, but also benefit-led with blended products) to Yogurts and more nascent ones such as Cheese or Ice Cream.\n\n- **TOP 3 BRANDS IN SALES IN 2022**\n  - #2 DANONE\n  - #1 ACTIVIA\n  - #3 SILK\n\nSPECIALIZED NUTRITION (SN)\n\n- **POSITION:** IN 2022, DANONE WAS WORLDWIDE\n  - #2 IN INFANT NUTRITION\n  - #4 IN ADULT NUTRITION\n\n- **IN SPECIALIZED NUTRITION DANONE HAS STRONG LEADERSHIP PROVIDING BABY FORMULA**\n  grounded in our scientific expertise in biotics and 50 years of advanced breastmilk science, with product propositions like Aptamil Cesarbiotik 3 and Aptamil Dairy & Plants Blend which recognize that every family\u2019s feeding journey is unique.\n\n- **IN SPECIALIZED NUTRITION, DANONE ALSO SUPPORTS PATIENTS WITH SPECIFIC NUTRITIONAL NEEDS DUE TO A MEDICAL CONDITION, such as cow\u2019s milk allergy, metabolic diseases, and cancer or stroke, through its paediatric and adult medical nutrition portfolio.**\n\n- **TOP 3 BRANDS IN SALES IN 2022**\n  - #2 NUTRISON\n  - #1 APTAMIL\n  - #3 NEOCATE\n\nWATERS\n\n- **POSITION:** IN 2022, DANONE WAS WORLDWIDE\n  - #2 IN WATERS\n\n- **IN WATERS, THE GROUP IS WELL POSTIONED TO BUILD ON A LONG-TERM TREND**\n  (water will remain the healthiest hydration option) and, of the recovery of the Category following COVID-19 lockdowns.

It was a simple food, with a simple aim to improve health. Over the years, as people\u2019s lifestyles and tastes have evolved, Danone has continued to anticipate and innovate to meet people\u2019s needs.\n\nThis commitment has never wavered. It is enshrined since 2020 in our by laws through our \u201cSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Mission\u201d status.\n\nWe have built a unique health-focused portfolio. Across our business and our brands, health is at the cornerstone of our impact. But we know that our health impact is dependent on a healthy planet, as well as thriving people and communities. Thus, the three pillars of the Danone Impact Journey are intimately interdependent.\n\nThe Impact Journey is a blueprint for defining our sustainability priorities and our transformation ambition in our value chain \u2013 from farmers and their communities, through our brands, to consumers and their families.\n\nOur ambition is to unite sustainability and performance to continue to grow our impact. We know that the long-term robustness and resilience of our business is dependent on our success in delivering health through food in the most sustainable way.\n\nWith the Danone Impact Journey, we have a clear framework to drive our actions and progress for the future.\nOUR MISSION TO BRING HEALTH THROUGH FOOD TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE IS AT THE CENTER OF THE DANONE IMPACT JOURNEY, A THREAD RUNNING THROUGH ALL THREE IMPACT AREAS AND COMMITMENTS.\n\nTHE DANONE IMPACT JOURNEY GROUNDS OUR COMMITMENTS TOWARDS FULL B CORP CERTIFICATION AND AS A SOCI\u00c9T\u00c9 \u00c0 MISSION, helping us to embed impact into our business structure, management practices, and performance indicators.\n\n**SINCE 2015, WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH B LAB**\nto help define a meaningful and manageable path to certification for multinationals and publicly traded companies while progressively certifying our business and supporting the broader growth of the B Corp movement. In 2022, 74.2% of Danone global net sales were covered by B Corp certification. The Danone Impact Journey is fully in line with what we believe will help us achieve 100% B Corp certification by 2025.\n\n**IN 2022, WE PROGRESSED IN OUR SOCI\u00c9T\u00c9 \u00c0 MISSION JOURNEY**\nby setting measurable, quantifiable KPIs for our 2025 agenda as well as annual trajectories to ensure consistent progress. This process was overseen by the Mission Committee. The 2025 KPIs are reflected in the Danone Impact Journey.\n\nFor more information, see the Danone 2022 Mission Committee Report.\n\nThe Danone Impact Journey reflects Danone\u2019s material topics across all three pillars: Health, Nature, and People & Communities. This is particularly true with the material topic of \u201cintegration of sustainability into the business\u201d, by anchoring environmental, social and societal performance into our business model.

This requires ambitious action on our part, but also working with our ecosystem to push for systemic changes.\n\nTo meet our ambitions, we have developed the following goals and KPIs:\n\n| GOAL | KPIs |\n|------|------|\n| Curb GHG emissions in line with 1.5\u00b0C, leading the way on methane reduction | CO\u2082 reduction by 2030 in line with 1.5\u00b0C SBTi |\n| | Net Zero by 2050 |\n| | 30% reduction in methane emissions from fresh milk by 2030 |\n| | 30% improvement in energy efficiency by 2025 |\n| Pioneer and scale regenerative agriculture, leading the way for regenerative dairy farming models | 30% key ingredients we source directly will come from farms that have begun to transition to RegAg by 2025 |\n| | Zero deforestation & conversion on key commodities by 2025\u00b9 |\n| Preserve and restore watersheds where we operate and drive water footprint reduction across the value chain | 4R approach will be deployed in all our production sites by 2030 |\n| | Watershed preservation/restoration plans in highly water-stressed areas by 2030\u00b2 |\n| Drive the transition to a circular and low-carbon packaging system & recover as much as we use | 100% reusable, recyclable, compostable by 2030 |\n| | Halve the use of virgin fossil-based packaging by 2040, with a 30% reduction by 2030, accelerating reuse and recycled materials |\n| | Lead the development of effective collection systems to recover as much plastic as we use by 2040 |\n| Cut waste across the value chain | Halve all food waste not fit for human, animal consumption or biomaterial processing by 2030 vs. 2020 |\n\nTO DELIVER ON OUR MISSION, WE DEPEND ON NATURE.\n\nToday, the natural environment on which we depend is facing many interrelated threats, from climate change and nature loss to water scarcity and pollution. As a global leader in the food and beverage sector, our ambition at Danone, is to make food in a manner that respects, preserves and regenerates nature.\nOUR AMBITIONS AND 2022 HIGHLIGHTS\n\nCurb GHG emissions in line with 1.5\u00b0C, leading the way on methane reduction\n\n**Ambition:**\nContributing to roughly a third of global emissions, food systems have an essential role to play in tackling the climate crisis. As a global leader in the food and beverage sector, we are committed to decarbonizing our business, transforming our full value chain in line with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway, and strengthening resilience of the communities we touch.\n\nMethane reduction is essential to meeting our 1.5\u00b0C ambition. According to the Environmental Defense Fund, methane has more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide over the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere. Acting now to reduce methane emissions will provide immediate benefits to the climate that carbon dioxide reductions cannot achieve on their own. Dairy cattle represent an estimated 8% of methane emissions, so as a global dairy leader we can make a meaningful contribution. This is why in 2023, Danone was the first global food company in the world to set a methane target. By 2030, we aim to achieve a 30% reduction in methane emissions from fresh milk.\n\n**Key 2022 highlights**\n- Danone was among the first companies to have its 1.5\u00b0C Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) target approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)\\(^1\\)\n- 8.3% absolute total FLAG emissions reduction since 2020 (2030 science based target: -30.3%)\n- 70.5% of renewable electricity\n- Switch to renewable electricity sources in Indonesia, Mexico, and in the Steenvoorde Supply Point in France\n\nIn early 2023, Danone announced an ambitious plan to reduce absolute methane emissions from fresh milk for our dairy products by 30% compared to a 2020 baseline, aligning our efforts with the Global Methane Pledge and confirming methane reduction as an essential pillar of our 1.5\u00b0C journey.\n\nPioneer and scale regenerative agriculture, leading the way for regenerative dairy farming models\n\n**Ambition:**\nAs a food company, one of the most important ways to deliver positive environmental and societal impact is through the farming model we chose. Agriculture is the largest source of Danone\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, representing 59% of our total emissions in 2022, and 89% of water use. Danone is firmly committed to regenerative agriculture, an outcome-based, holistic approach with three dimensions \u2013 people, planet and animals. When adopted under the right conditions, this approach can maximize the benefits of agriculture by protecting and improving soil health, biodiversity, water resources and climate, while promoting animal welfare and supporting farming resilience and long-term profitability. Indeed, regenerative agriculture is a key enabler of progress on other Danone ambitions related to climate action, water preservation, deforestation and conversion, and social progress.\n\n**Key 2022 highlights**\n- Renewed Forest Policy, with the ambition to continue and amplify efforts in protecting and restoring forests\n- Update of the Danone Regenerative Agriculture Handbook and Scorecard and launch of associated digital tool\n- Action plans to convert manure into organic fertilizers through compost and biodigesters, the traceability of animal feeds in areas with no deforestation risks and improved cow productivity in Brazil\n\n**H\u2019LIB BLADI!**\nThe H\u2019lib Bladi project\u2019s mission is to strengthen a sustainable milk production model in Morocco that will improve the livelihoods of small farmers and their resilience to climate change.\n\nThe project was co-designed and launched with the support of Danone Ecosystem, Centrale Danone and GIZ International, non-profit organization governed by German law.\n\n**The project launched in 2016. Its first phase has been structured around the following:**\n- 1900 farmers took part in collective training to learn best practices to be implemented at dairy farm level, including herd management, animal health, milking hygiene, cow welfare, feed, nutrition and reproduction\n- The farmers received targeted support to develop local feed solutions\n- H\u2019lib Bladi supported over 500 farms in securing free access to water, in order to ensure cows drink sufficiently\n\n**This project is creating impact across several dimensions:**\n\n**Social:**\n- 1900 farmers trained, including 327 women\n- 71 young people have been trained to develop local self-employment\n\n**Environmental:**\n- CO\u2082 impact assessed via Cool Farm Tool, a specific tool dedicated to the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions from cattle\n- Pilots on biodigesters, planted filters, solar heaters, and the use of sorghum\n- Water management in Milk Collection Centers in farms\n\nThis project, although already impactful, has shown broader potential. In the context of unprecedented drought and inflation in 2022, a second phase of project will aim to scale up the best practices, in particular feed adaptations to reduce water consumption along the chain and techniques to enhance animal welfare while lowering methane emissions.\nOur Ambitions and 2022 Highlights\n\nPreserve and Restore Watersheds Where We Operate and Drive Water Footprint Reduction Across the Value Chain\n\nAmbition:\nAt Danone, water is essential to our mission and our activity. For decades, alongside local communities, we have been protecting some of the world\u2019s best known natural mineral water sources and their watersheds. We are committed to continuing this stewardship and bringing our expertise in water management to as many communities as possible around the world, while driving water reduction and protection throughout our value chain. This is all the more important given that water pressures are severe and growing. More than two billion people lack access to safe water today, and by 2030, the world will face a 40% shortfall in freshwater supply according to the United Nations. It\u2019s an urgent challenge but also an opportunity: water can drive sustainable economic growth, and help us accelerate solutions to address the climate and biodiversity crises.\n\nKey 2022 Achievements\n- 86% of production sites having implemented water 4R approach\n- Danone\u2019s largest reclaim unit in Wevelgem, Belgium has produced 700 million liters of reclaimed water from treated wastewater, enabling a plant water intake reduction of 50% and a water discharge volume reduction of 70% compared to 2020 without reclaim\n- evian celebrated the many initiatives it has developed over the past 30 years with local communities to ensure the preservation of water resources, in particular through the Association pour la Protection de l\u2019Impluvium de l\u2019Eau Min\u00e9rale evian (APIEME)\n\nDrive the Transition to a Circular and Low-Carbon Packaging System & Recover as Much as We Use\n\nAmbition:\nPackaging is fundamental to providing safe access to food and drinks, minimizing food waste and preserving quality. Yet the global packaging system\u2014dependent on linear, virgin fossil-fuel derived plastic\u2014must be transformed. Danone has embraced the ambition of a circular economy of packaging, in which plastic never becomes waste or pollution, and the value of products and materials is retained in the economy. We have been working with industry, governments and civil society partners to transform our packaging in line with this vision and drive broader systems change. While progress has been slowed by a number of systemic barriers, including underdeveloped reuse schemes, and limited collection and recycling infrastructure, Danone is reaffirming its ambition to help overcome these barriers and accelerate progress towards a circular, low-carbon economy of packaging.\n\nKey 2022 Achievements\n- As of 2022, 84% of Danone packaging is reusable, recyclable or compostable\n- For our Dairy business, Danone is successfully expanding its dairy dispenser offer for HORECA (Hotels, Restaurants and Catering) in Spain\n- In several countries, such as Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey, Danone sells reusable water containers, as well as reusable glass packaging for the hotel, cafes and restaurant industry. In 2022, around 50% of the worldwide sales volumes by the Water brands were sold in reusable packaging\n- For our Waters business, Danone started piloting a mineral water refill model called \u201cevian comme \u00e0 la source\u201d in France, which is expected to reduce both plastic usage and CO2 emissions compared to single-use plastic bottles for restaurants and out-of-home\n\nCut Waste Across the Value Chain\n\nAmbition:\nMore than a billion tons of food is lost or wasted each year, according to the World Food Programme, with major environmental, social and economic consequences. As a food company, we have a key role to play in reducing food waste and maximizing its recovery. At Danone, cutting waste is a key opportunity to help reduce pressure on natural resources while strengthening efficiencies and supporting communities in need.\n\nKey 2022 Achievements\n- -13.5% reduction in the total quantity of food waste per metric ton of product sold, excluding waste intended for animal feed and the processing of biomaterials\u2014SDG 12.3, since 2020 on a like-for-like basis\n- Danone is committed to reducing food waste in its end-to-end supply chain. The Group launched an extensive global program named the Battle against waste, designed to deliver sustainability and productivity targets. The project engages end to end supply chain stakeholders, partners externally with suppliers and customers and leverages internal expertise to halve Danone\u2019s food waste by 2030\n- Across 2022, Danone continued to raise awareness of food waste and inform consumers on date labeling and shifting date labels from \u2018use-by\u2019 to \u2018best-before\u2019 in key European markets. In collaboration with Too Good To Go Danone is also adding the \u2018look, smell, taste, don\u2019t waste\u2019 label on pack\n- In the UK specifically, to help to amplify this campaign and raise awareness among our consumers, we partnered with Sainsbury\u2019s to kick off a food waste reduction campaign in store\n- TWO GOOD made a partnership with Full Harvest\u00ae, a surplus produce-rescuing organization, that helps us source the ingredients we use to make GOOD SAVE\u00ae yogurt\nTHRIVING\n\nPEOPLE & COMMUNITIES\n\nTHIS PILLAR RELATES TO DANONE\u2019S FOLLOWING MATERIAL TOPICS:\n\n- Responsible procurement/supply chain management\n- Local sourcing and rural/farmer development\n- Some material topics related to People & Communities in tier 2 and tier 3 of the matrix\nDANONE HAS A STRONG LEGACY OF SOCIAL IMPACT,\nfrom Antoine Riboud\u2019s groundbreaking speech in 1972 and the launch of Danone\u2019s Dual Project, to the extension of quality healthcare coverage through Dan\u2019Cares, and the integration of social objectives into our company bylaws as a \u201cSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Mission\u201d. Our social heritage has forged a unique culture within Danone, where purpose is deeply integrated into how we do business.\n\nTHIS HERITAGE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER AS WE LOOK AT THE SOCIAL LANDSCAPE AHEAD.\nThe world is experiencing levels of economic uncertainty, technological advancement and social change not seen at a global level for generations. We know the pace of transformation will only accelerate, as we confront the disruptions of climate change, digital transformation, and fragmented supply chains. The Social Contract between business and society needs renewal, and Danone wants to play a meaningful role.\n\nTo meet our ambitions, we have developed the following goals and KPIs:\n\n| GOAL | KPIs |\n|------|------|\n| Make Danone a force for good by fostering a unique, diverse & inclusive culture and empowering Danoners for positive impact | All employees covered by B Corp certification by 2025(1) |\n| Equip and empower communities (i.e. internal, external) with skills and capabilities of the future to thrive in a fast changing economy | All employees covered by Dan\u2019Care by 2030 |\n| Champion a renewed social contract by fostering a prosperous & inclusive ecosystem, upholding human rights and pursuing social progress | Achieve gender balance in management globally by 2030 |\n| | Drive equity and close gender pay gap by 2025 |\n| | Maintain inclusion index above peers(2) |\n| | Make future skilling programs available to all Danoners by 2025 |\n| | Extend future skilling programs to key partners by 2030 |\n| | 100% employees trained on Danone Human Rights policy by 2025(3) |\n| | Danone Responsible Sourcing Policy deployed to all suppliers by 2030 |\nMAKE DANONE A FORCE FOR GOOD BY FOSTERING A UNIQUE DIVERSE & INCLUSIVE CULTURE AND EMPOWERING DANONERS FOR POSITIVE IMPACT\n\nAMBITION:\nAs a Group with a presence in over 120 countries, we have a unique opportunity for collective impact across countries, cultures and communities. This starts with our people: almost 100,000 Danoners around the world working together to create value for our world. As a Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Mission and Group evolving towards B Corp certification, this is not just an aspiration, it is coded into our DNA. We are working to embed impact into our governance, management policies and practices, and the cultural fabric of our Group. We aim to enable every Danone employee to be a force for good in the Group and throughout our communities.\n\nKEY 2022 HIGHLIGHTS\n\n42% of women in senior managers positions (executives and directors)\n3.2 points gender pay gap ratio (in manager, directors & executives positions)\nDanone\u2019s parental policy is deployed in all countries in which we operate\n94,761 employees covered by Dan\u2019Cares (fully or partially)\n\nDANONE PEOPLE SURVEY RESULTS\n\nMore than 90% of employees provided their personal view on their day-to-day experience at Danone, their teams, company values and more\nScore of 86% of the Inclusion index, measured through the Danone People Survey\n\nSOME OF OUR EXTERNAL RECOGNITIONS:\n\n- Bloomberg Center Equity Index 2023\n- DIVERSITY LEADER 2023\n- EQUILEAP\n\nIN 2022, THE HUMAN RESOURCES TEAM FACILITATED AN INTENSE GLOBAL CONVERSATION ON CULTURE.

It makes them proud, and attracts new talent to the Group.\n\nDANONE BRAZIL SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED A PROJECT BY PARTNERING WITH A LOCAL NGO TO DESIGN RECRUITING PROCESSES\n\nand improve the conditions for people with disabilities. The percentage of employees that declare to have some type of disabilities reached 5% of the workforce in Danone Brazil as of December 2022\n\nACTIVIA \u201cACT4CHANGE\u201d\n\nWITH THE ACTIVIA BRAND, DANONE ITALY PROMOTED A MOVEMENT CALLED ACT4CHANGE THROUGH WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO GIVE A VOICE TO MANY WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY PANDEMIC-RELATED JOB LOSSES\n\nAt Danone, we consider the loss of talented women in the workplace not only as an opportunity taken away from women, but from the whole community. That is why the adoption of policies that promote women\u2019s employment, for example by ensuring equal career opportunities, equal pay and protections, should be considered fundamental in every environment and organization. Therefore, since 2011 we have been supporting inclusive diversity, parents and caregivers. With Act4change we wanted to boost our support for equal opportunities, starting with the awareness of the extent to which the COVID-19 impacted the workplace especially for women, amplifying social inequalities even more. Using the Activia brand, we have become a spokesperson for a socially relevant issue for all: female unemployment. Thanks to the support of Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs), we launched four live events open to all, an online educational workshop dedicated to 250 women and a masterclass to give voice to each of them again.\n\nIMPACT:\n\n- 250 PEOPLE HAD THE CHANCE TO INCREASE THEIR WORK PLACEMENT OPPORTUNITIES thanks to the chance to work on their references and to get in touch with Adecco\u2019s specialists\n- THE MASTERCLASS ACHIEVED 2,129 TOTAL VIEWS ON THE LANDING PAGE, a conversion rate of 26% and the participation of over 160 people, 87% of whom said they had gained awareness of the topic after the meeting\n- 250 PEOPLE HAD THE CHANCE TO INCREASE THEIR WORK PLACEMENT OPPORTUNITIES thanks to the chance to work on their references and to get in touch with Adecco\u2019s specialists\n- THE MASTERCLASS ACHIEVED 2,129 TOTAL VIEWS ON THE LANDING PAGE, a conversion rate of 26% and the participation of over 160 people, 87% of whom said they had gained awareness of the topic after the meeting\n\nCLICK HERE\nDanone received the Gender Equality Diversity and Internal Standard - Sustainable Development Goal Award of the Arborus Foundation for the \u201cAlban Baladine\u201d Milk Collection Centers project in Egypt. The project helps to empower small milk producers with a focus on the key role of women in dairy production. The target is to have social impact by opening milk collection centers and providing small milk producers with access to a wide range of services, including milk analysis and storage to increase and maintain their cows\u2019 productivity. Over 8,500 small farmers, 94% of which are women, have been empowered through sustainable revenue streams.\n\n**EQUIP AND EMPOWER COMMUNITIES WITH SKILLS AND CAPABILITIES OF THE FUTURE TO THRIVE IN A FAST CHANGING ECONOMY**\n\n**AMBITION:**\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, it is estimated that 50% of job capabilities worldwide will change in the next decade, and the need for adaptation will accelerate. We believe we can play an important role in this context, leveraging our global reach, ecosystem and expertise to support knowledge and skills creation and transfer, among our employees and throughout our ecosystem.\n\n**KEY 2022 HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n**100% OF OUR ENTITIES DISCUSSED WITH UNIONS OR EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES AND PROPOSED THE FUTURESKILLS PROGRAM TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES**\n\nDanone is committed to supporting employees who need to acquire new skills. The Group worked with the International Union of Food Workers (IUF) to develop an innovative approach called FutureSkills, which aims to better prepare employees who need new skills for the jobs of tomorrow (see the common statement by Danone and the IUF signed in 2020, available on Danone\u2019s corporate website). FutureSkills aims to allow Danone\u2019s employees to have the opportunity and the time to develop new skills that can facilitate internal repositioning within Danone but can also be of value and practical assistance in the broader job market. In 2022, we continued to deploy this program.\n\n**Champion a renewed social contract by fostering a prosperous & inclusive ecosystem, upholding human rights and pursuing social progress**\n\n**AMBITION:**\nAs a Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Mission and Group evolving towards B Corp certification, our social impact must extend throughout our business, from suppliers to retailers, and across our communities, from local to global. We hold ourselves to the highest standards for our business practices and stakeholder engagement, fostering relationships with our stakeholders that are grounded in trust and guided by open dialogue. Through this dialogue, we can renew our Social Contract built on a foundation of human rights, dignity, and shared social progress.\n\n**KEY 2022 HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n- **Projet Avenir**: Danone launched a skills development plan that involved 120 people with learning modules for all the operators as part of Villecomtal site (France) evolution towards Plant-Based\n\n- **In Fulda, Germany, to support the transition of the plant to a new packaging technology, the FutureSkills program was deployed in the form of in-depth professional training programs to prepare each team member for jobs of the future**\n\n- **The Danone dedicated e-learning training program on human rights and fight against forced labor is available on the Group training platform to the Procurement, Human Resources and General Secretary functions. 6,658 Danone employees had completed this training at the end of 2022.**\n\n- **In 2022, Danone concluded the salient human right impact assessment and used the learnings to update and upgrade the Danone Sustainability Principles together with their implementation guidance and to develop its Human Rights Policy. The salient impacts will further inform Danone\u2019s human rights strategy.**\n\n- **As a member of the Consumer Good Forum (CGF)\u2019s Human Rights Coalition \u2013 Working to end forced labour, Danone pledged to develop and deploy Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) systems focusing on forced labor in its own operations, with the aim of reaching 100% coverage by 2025, including external workers hired by temporary work agencies or by its subcontractors to carry out regular and continuous work at its entities. In 2022, Danone piloted the first steps of the Coalition due diligence framework in its Polish and Brazil Business Units, which were selected mainly on the basis of the number of external workers and awareness and engagement of the local teams.**\n\n- **Danone is committed to supporting employees who need to acquire new skills.

Over 8,500 small farmers, 94% of which are women, have been empowered through sustainable revenue streams.**\nOur impact is collective. For over 50 years, since the launch of the Danone Dual Project, we have been working with and through a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, ranging from policy-makers, customers, suppliers, farmers, researchers and NGOs, to our consumers and shareholders. Strengthening these relationships is part of our responsibility to build a more sustainable future and create value for all our stakeholders.\n\n**EMPLOYEES**\nWe believe in empowering our almost 100,000 employees to bring our vision to life. Building on our value, we strive to create a culture where performance and sustainability go hand in hand and where the best of our local and global presence can seamlessly come together. To do so, we valorize our talents and their passion, ensuring that they are at the core of our progress.\n\n**SUPPLIERS**\nRecognizing that our suppliers also have a major role to play in delivering our Danone Impact Journey, we are committed to promoting sustainable, inclusive growth with them, by fostering partnerships and developing mutually beneficial relationship. Transparency, as well as a mindset of continuous improvement, are therefore key to our supplier engagement.\n\nThe Group works directly with selected producers further up the supply chain and has developed many collaborative projects that help producers address environmental and labor issues, such as a vanilla plantation project in Madagascar supported by the Livelihoods Fund for Family Farming (L3F). The aim of this project, which involves 3,000 family farms, is to develop solutions that improve the quality and traceability of vanilla production, boost food security for farmers and preserve biodiversity. An impact study performed in 2022 shows that the project has preserved 770 hectares of local biodiversity in the Pointe \u00e0 Larr\u00e9e protected area. Overall, according to 88% of producers involved in the project, the human activities that are threatening biodiversity have decreased significantly.\n\n**SHAREHOLDERS**\nWe are committed to sustainable shared value creation, an engagement which has driven our vision of business since the establishment of our dual economic and social project in 1972. At the heart of this project lies the belief that commitment to all stakeholders creates further value for shareholders.\n\n**TRADE UNIONS**\nWe are committed to strengthening social dialogue. Over the last 50 years, Danone has engaged in fruitful discussions with Trade Unions: ten international agreements define a common set of policies across the Group, on major topics such as Trade Unions rights, Skills Development, Working Conditions, Health & Safety, Diversity, Limitation of Precarious Work. The Group also worked with the International Union of Food Workers (IUF) to develop an innovative approach, FutureSkills, which aims to better prepare employees who need new skills for the jobs of tomorrow. At Danone, we believe that Trade Unions are a trusted source of information and insights on social practices inside and outside the company. As a result, they take part in the Due Diligence activities as whistleblowers on the respect of fundamental rights.\n\n**COMMUNITIES**\nWe contribute to the development of communities, people and the environment, mainly through our brands and social innovation funds. Working with Danone Communities, Danone Ecosystem Fund and Livelihood Funds, we also support community-led projects, which have had major impacts on the fight against malnutrition, inclusive business solution and the reduction of carbon emissions.\n\nIn 2022, Danone Ecosystem is celebrating 100 projects, benefiting to more than 5.5 million people.\n\n**CONSUMERS**\nWe listen to and respond to the fast-changing expectations of consumers worldwide, by tailoring to their preferences sustainably produced food and drink options that nurture health at every stage of life. We commit to achieving the highest nutritional standards, adhering to responsible communications, and minimizing our environmental footprint in the production process.\nTo facilitate positive impact, we have forged partnerships with civil society partners and other such organizations that share our vision for a more sustainable future. They are also able to give us key insights into, and inputs on, our mission and projects, at both a community level and a more global one. We also work with these partners to actively promote change for the better, whether that be in favor of the adoption of best agricultural practices among our farmers, or through public advocacy for causes we believe in. Some of our key impact partners include B Lab, Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Environmental Defense Fund, RAMSAR, Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), OECD, WWF and UNITAR.\n\nDanone also believes regulation is critical to unlocking systemic solutions to support dairy farm transformation - from supporting research and innovation, co-financing, to ambition-setting, and driving a level playing field. That is why, in Europe, Danone is supporting the European Commission\u2019s Climate Neutral Farms (ClieNFarm) project to co-develop and upscale systemic, locally relevant solutions (organisational, financial, technical) to reach climate neutral, resilient and sustainable farms.\n\nOn strategic topics such as food safety, healthy food and drink habits, probiotics, microbiota, healthy hydration, and healthy aging, research plays a central role in our growth strategy. By partnering with the academic and scientific world, we seek to improve our understanding of health and nutrition issues at every stage of life and integrate this knowledge in the development of healthy and innovative products, purpose-driven brand strategies, and impactful programs.\n\nDanone works with a large number of farmers, including 58,000 dairy farmers, worldwide. About 94% of the partner producers own small family farms with fewer than 25 cows and are located primarily in emerging countries in Africa and Latin America. As well as actively supporting our farmers and providing them with equipment and training to adopt more regenerative practices, we have developed innovative long-term contracts with our farmers, which cover 25% of the global milk volume we collect.\n\nWe are stepping up collaboration and investments with our retailers and business partners and growing our distribution channels, in order to reach more consumers and help them make healthier, more sustainable choices, anytime and anywhere. We activate our brands in-store and across multiple platform, to match local tastes, lifestyles and shopping preferences.\n\nWe are partnering with food tech startups across the world that share our vision of a healthy and sustainable future for food. Through Danone Manifesto Ventures, Danone\u2019s corporate venture arm, we invest in high growth and promising companies and entrepreneurs who bring unique products and disruptive models to the market, further helping the acceleration of growth by providing them access to Danone\u2019s world-class expertise and resources.\n\nSymbrosia, a Hawai\u2018i-based startup with a seaweed feed additive that reduces livestock methane emissions by over 80%, has closed out its Series A funding round with $7M. This funding round was led by Danone Manifesto Ventures. After two years of research on seaweed breeding and cultivation technology, Symbrosia has developed strains that are significantly more productive, potent and resilient than wild populations. The company will use the capital to scale production of these breakthrough seaweed strains by orders of magnitude and bring their livestock feed additive, SeaGraze\u2122, to market with the world\u2019s most innovative brands and producers.\nBY BEING BOTH AT THE HEART OF THE HEALTHY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD MOVEMENT AND ATTUNED TO KEY CONSUMERS\u2019 EXPECTATIONS, WE KNOW IT IS INSTRUMENTAL TO CONSTANTLY IDENTIFY AND ANTICIPATE THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT LIE AHEAD.\n\nEngaging with our stakeholders is an important way in which we strive to do so. As such, we rely on two complementary exercises involving the input of our key stakeholders: a materiality assessment and a risk analysis, the former focusing on sustainability issues and the latter being a wider tool to anticipate all types of risks a company is facing for its operations and broader value chain. Both of these provide us with an in-depth understanding of the key strategic interlinked sustainability and business topics that Danone must take into account and act upon.\n\nTo find out more about our risk analysis, refer to our Universal Registration Document 2022, Chapter 2.\nIntegration of sustainability into the business\n\nWe believe we have a role to play in society. It was thus logical for us to further our journey as a sustainable business by obtaining the French \u201cSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Mission\u201d status, and the B Corp certification, both which contribute to anchoring environmental and social performance in our business model.\n\nConsumer behavior change\n\nAs part of our mission, we actively promote consumer education on healthier lifestyles and diets. To do so, we notably partner with local authorities and organizations, as well as retailers, in order to provide consumers with better knowledge on health and food, and empower them to choose healthier options.\n\nNutritional quality of overall product portfolio\n\nAs a critical health factor, the nutritional value of food products is of growing concern to both consumers and regulators. Our everyday products strive to bring key nutrients relevant to their food categories and to limit certain nutrients, with a focus on sugars. As a result, 91% of the product volumes sold are in healthy categories and 88% of the product volumes sold scored \u22653.5 stars according to the Health Star Rating system. According to this system, any product that scores 3.5 stars or above can be confidently promoted as a healthy choice (1).\n\nNew consumption patterns / planetary diet\n\nTo answer an ever-rising demand for more climate-conscious and sustainable products, but also to adjust to increasingly specific consumer needs and preferences, we are continuously adapting our portfolio. Danone has been at the forefront of these changing consumer preferences to promote more healthy, nutritious and sustainable offerings and ensure that our products answer to local consumer diets and cultural or religious preferences. Integrating more low-carbon and plant-based products into our portfolio has also been key to address these challenges.\n\nProduct safety/quality\n\nAs it relates to production quality, spoilage, contamination, supply chain traceability, and allergy labeling, product safety and quality can materially affect Danone\u2019s operations and brand reputation, particularly amid new regulations and increasing transparency requirements. At Danone, we therefore have a responsibility to ensure the safety and quality of our products throughout our value chain, through actions such as certifications and supporting our suppliers in this journey.\nClimate change\nWe are conscious that the food & beverage industry production value chain is a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, a direct cause of climate change. In return, climate change presents several risks for society and for our business (increased costs of doing business, reduced operational efficiency, supply disruptions, etc.). To try and mitigate these risks, in 2015, we updated our climate policy announcing our intention to reach net zero emissions and set intermediate reduction targets to deliver tangible progress.\n\nCircular economy/packaging/waste\nThroughout its entire lifecycle, packaging materials contribute significantly to our overall environmental footprint. At Danone, we have therefore set a number of ambitious targets in line with the Global Commitment on Plastics led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. We also work hand-in-hand with suppliers, product distributors, retail companies, startups, NGOs and policymakers to find innovative solutions.\n\nSustainable farming/land use\nAgriculture is at the center of numerous global challenges today, from economic development and climate change, to water scarcity and biodiversity loss. Encouraging our suppliers to transition to more sustainable farming practices, and accompanying them to do so, is at the core of our mission and is key to our business resilience. We have since been working to transform practices on the ground through regenerative agriculture programs in countries across the world.\n\nWater stewardship (incl. bottled water)\nBecause we are reliant on water supplies for both our food products and bottled waters, we are conscious of the issue of water scarcity, not only in terms of the operational risks it poses to our business, but also in terms of our activities\u2019 impacts on the availability and quality of water. For these reasons, we designed policies and practices concerning the prevention of risks related to our water usage, that include, but are not limited to, preservation of watersheds, water use in agriculture, wastewater discharge, etc. Most notably, our Water Policy lays out our framework to become \u2018water positive\u2019 and have a positive impact on nature and local communities through our fully circular water management in and around operations, as well as our water access programs for vulnerable communities, among other actions.\n\nFood/water access and affordability\nMaking our food and water products accessible to as many people as possible, whether geographically or in terms of price point, is at the heart of our company mission and responsibility. Making our offerings available to low income populations will help us combat hunger and malnutrition, inspire healthier and more sustainable eating and drinking practices and address the global issue of access to safe drinking water.\n\nLocal sourcing and rural/farmer development\nWe work alongside our suppliers to ensure that our sourcing practices are responsible for consumers, producers and farmers alike. This involves sourcing key ingredients locally (i.e. in the country where the products are sold), a practice which we are expanding every year, particularly for plant-based products and fruits & vegetables. By doing so, we aim to support and strengthen local farming communities.\n\nResponsible procurement/supply chain management\nDanone sources a wide range of ingredients, particularly dairy inputs, from suppliers globally. In line with due diligence requirements and with our status as a \u201cSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Mission\u201d, we work to ensure inputs are responsibly sourced. This means partnering with suppliers to minimize risks of negative impacts. It also means providing direct support to farmers we work with, including technical support, capacity building, capital investments, and innovations that improve farm performance, both environmentally and economically.\nPursuant to the Company\u2019s by-laws and the Board of Directors\u2019 rules of procedure, the Board, a collegial body, exercises the powers attributed to it by law and acts in all cases in the business interest of Danone.

Since then, the share ownership plan was extended to additional countries. In 2022, the plan covered 46 countries, representing 83% of Danone employees worldwide.\n- Lastly, in 2019, for the first time, Danone granted each eligible employee one DANONE share, thus giving the employee the right to vote at the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting. This share grant also enables employees to participate in a global profit-sharing system indexed on the amount of the annual dividend. Each year, every single new Danone employee receives a Group share.\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES\n\nDANONE AT A GLANCE\n\n(1) Like-for-like\n(2) On a reported basis\n(3) United States and Canada\n(4) China, Japan, Australia and New Zealand\n(5) Volumes sold in healthy categories corresponds to:\n   \u2022 Dairy and plant-based products intended for daily consumption,\n   \u2022 Specialized Nutrition Category products (except biscuits and beverages for children under 3 years of age and foods for children over 3 years of age in the early life nutrition activities),\n   \u2022 All plain and flavored water varieties with 0% sugar\n\nBECOMING A B CORP\n\n(1) Every year, B Lab recognizes the top-performing B Corps creating great impact through their businesses.

HSR algorithm considers negative components of the products that could potentially increase some health risks such as energy, saturated fat, sodium and total sugars. It also considers positive components of a product such as the content of fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes; in some instances, dietary fiber and protein. Taking these components into account, points are allocated based on the composition per 100g or 100 mL of the product. Products are rated between 0.5 stars (least healthy) to 5 stars (most healthy). According to this system, any product that scores 3.5 stars or above can be confidently promoted as a healthy choice.\n17, bd Haussmann - 75009 Paris - France\nTel: +33 1 44 35 20 20\nwww.danone.com\n\nMailing address\n15, rue du Helder - 75009 Paris - France\n\nDesign\nH\u00e9ctor Chiarri", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-04-09", "created": "2025-04-09", "metadata": {"Source-File": "climate_reports/ccrm_2024/danone_2022.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.1.59", "pdf-total-pages": 31, "total-input-tokens": 71961, "total-output-tokens": 17711, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 1340, 2], [1340, 4488, 3], [4488, 6379, 4], [6379, 8751, 5], [8751, 10130, 6], [10130, 11813, 7], [11813, 12846, 8], [12846, 13129, 9], [13129, 15697, 10], [15697, 18737, 11], [18737, 22772, 12], [22772, 22968, 13], [22968, 25018, 14], [25018, 30045, 15], [30045, 35150, 16], [35150, 35428, 17], [35428, 37394, 18], [37394, 41700, 19], [41700, 47468, 20], [47468, 51499, 21], [51499, 55131, 22], [55131, 56035, 23], [56035, 58439, 24], [58439, 62304, 25], [62304, 64053, 26], [64053, 65601, 27], [65601, 66755, 28], [66755, 70712, 29], [70712, 70712, 30], [70712, 70870, 31]]}}
