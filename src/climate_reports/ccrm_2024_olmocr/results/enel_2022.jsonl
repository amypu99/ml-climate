It now leads the international revolution in renewables and digital grids. We are conducting that revolution sustainably and innovatively, to decarbonize energy generation and to electrify consumption, promoting a just transition.\n\nThe year 2022 was another of great turbulence, characterized by converging crises: the continuation of the pandemic, the effects of climate change, economic uncertainty, dramatic conflicts that caused tensions in the energy commodity market and contributed to the exacerbation of inequalities and volatility in the supply chain.\n\nThe context has clarified the need to shift to an approach not limited to resistance during discontinuities, but able to innovate radically and constantly, anticipating and guiding the now-constant changes, to progressively reduce the business-related risks over time and to produce greater economic and social value.\n\nEnel has been adopting this approach for years: it has reduced dependence on fossil fuels and supplies from individual countries, decarbonized its energy generation, digitalized infrastructure, electrified consumption and created an innovation ecosystem, involving over 500,000 people from different countries, universities and about 600 startups. We can therefore monitor technological discontinuities and social inequalities and innovate to transform them into a source of competitive advantage, rather than merely undergo them.\n\nA concrete example of this approach is the expansion of 3SUN in Italy. By 2024, it is due to become the largest solar panel factory in Europe, with a production capacity of 3 GW per year, and will use a world-first innovative technology with a replicable business model, which will be useful to strengthen our independence in the value chain.\n\nOur ability to innovate has also enabled us to create Gridspertise, a company that assists other global operators in the digitalization of distribution networks. Gridspertise was established as a result of the innovations generated by collaborating with startups and leaders from other sectors. Together with them, we have created QEd, a revolutionary solution to digitalize various hardware components in the grid, thus saving costs and raw materials.\n\nOther examples are innovations in the storage sector, such as the completion in Tuscany in 2022 \u2013 with the collaboration of an Israeli startup \u2013 of the first thermal storage system in the world based on common stones, with no dependence on critical raw materials or use of chemical components.\nTo increasingly free ourselves from fluctuations in the price of commodities, in 2022 we accelerated the decarbonization of power generation, continuing the development of new renewable capacity and the decommissioning of fossil plants, such as the Bocamina II coal-fired power plant in Chile. Its recent closure means we have become the first electricity company to no longer use coal in the country.\n\nFrom photovoltaic panels to mini-wind farms, multiple technologies can assist in improving the reliability of the energy system. Customers can also become producers or can reduce the cost of energy, accelerating the path towards an electrified future. We remained the leader in demand response, with 8.5 GW of capacity managed for energy consumption. Electrification also entails electric mobility, which we are supporting by expanding the infrastructure, with 22,600 owned public charging points installed globally in the last year, and with the development of new technologies and flexible services to improve the customer experience.\n\nAnother key element of our ecosystem is the more than 172,000 suppliers, thanks to which we can innovate and make our value chain more and more decarbonized and sustainable. We are supporting them towards a sustainable growth that can increase their competitiveness and efficiency, by means of tangible development initiatives and access to services at advantageous conditions.\n\nConstant dialog with the communities in the countries where we operate enables us to jointly construct projects and solutions that respond to common priorities, promote local development and result in the creation of shared value in the long term. In 2022, there were already around 5 million global beneficiaries of our projects to foster sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth. In Italy, we\u2019ve been focusing on students leaving school too soon, on access to the world of work for the new generations and on training in the new skills required by the energy transition, including via the circularity of professions linked to the previous energy model, through reskilling and upskilling programs. The School4Life project \u2013 intended to support students and teachers to prevent early school leaving \u2013 will involve about 15,000 students in the two years from 2022 to 2023, whereas the Energie per Crescere (Energy for Growth) program, extended in early 2023 from the grids to the renewable generation sector, will provide technical training to 5,500 young people.\n\nA key element in the strategy is our people: now as much as throughout the 60 years of our history, they design the future of energy systems, with dedication and spirit of service even at the most difficult times and in the most extreme conditions. Our people have understood \u2013 and have helped others to understand \u2013 the great value of the resource we work with, and the necessity to use it efficiently and responsibly. By sharing our purpose of \u201cOpen power for a brighter future\u201d on a broader scale, we commit to making the energy system more and more safe and sustainable for our stakeholders.\nCOMPANY VIEW\n\n2.\nWe empower sustainable progress\n\nWe were founded 60 years ago to bring energy to the territories and communities, the same mission we have today but expanded by innovation, sustainability, and a reliable business model.\n\nWe aim to contribute to an affordable, secure and sustainable energy system by accelerating the decarbonization of our power generation, strengthening the role of distribution networks and creating products and services that make energy transition more effective and simpler in our customers\u2019 day-to-day.\n\nWe have outlined a sustainability strategy supporting the United Nations\u2019 17 Sustainable Development Goals with 4 out of the 17 goals guiding our value creation: SDG 13 \u201cClimate Action\u201d; SDG 7 \u201cAffordable and Clean Energy\u201d; SDG 9 \u201cIndustry, Innovation and Infrastructure\u201d; SDG 11 \u201cSustainable Cities and Communities\u201d.\n\nWe commit to a daily continuous improvement individually and collectively: people and communities, business, industries and institutions, leveraging growth accelerators (innovation, digitalization, circular economy and sustainability-linked finance).\nWe empower sustainable progress\n\nIn 2022 Enel celebrated its first 60 years: we were created to bring energy to the territories and communities, the same mission we have today but expanded by innovation, sustainability, and a reliable business model. As a result of the challenge of tackling climate change and the increasing digitalization of the traditional business models of companies in the energy sector, our mission has evolved in order to embrace new ways for making energy accessible thus empowering sustainable progress.\n\nThe current relevance of the climate change challenge, the repeated occurrence of extreme events, a high rate of loss of biodiversity and ecosystemic services need to be carefully addressed both in terms of preventing them to happen and of adapting to a changing climate.\n\nThe pandemic and the geopolitical conflicts have worsened the situation and unveiled how much individual countries and regions are intrinsically and structurally weak while making clear that energy independence and achievement of climate objectives require an acceleration of energy policies and a new design of the electricity market to promote the energy transition. By doing so, in the long-term, access to energy will happen at affordable and stable prices, will be secure since it will not be impacted by geopolitical conflicts, and will be sustainable, with no adverse effects on climate and ecosystems.\n\nThese are key years to achieve the UN 2030 agenda, the Paris Agreement climate objectives and the Kunming-Montreal agreement to stop and invert the trend of biodiversity loss. These objectives can only be reached by giving a push to decarbonization and clean electrification of end-uses, sustained by business models based on circular economy and open to continuous innovation.\n\nOur contribution to an affordable, secure and sustainable energy system leads us, therefore, first of all to accelerate the decarbonization of our energy generation, as a result of renewables development, utilization of storage and phase-out of thermal generation. In parallel, we will strengthen our distributions grids whose role is to enable the undergoing energy transition, also thanks to digital solutions that accommodate larger volumes of renewable energy, so as to make them more resilient, sustainable and open to all stakeholders in electrification. Finally, we are developing effective and easy-to-use products and services for our customers since the change involves all of us, individually and collectively: people and communities, companies, industries and institutions.\nOur sustainable business model and value creation\n\nWe have been confirmed as a leading group in the energy sector, with a presence in 47 countries on five continents, vertically integrated along the entire value chain.\n\nOur purpose, mission, vision and values animate the entire organization and define the aim of the Company itself. \u201cOpen Power for a brighter future: we empower sustainable progress\u201d, which expresses our daily commitment, the very reason why our people are motivated. Being Open Power means improving everyone\u2019s future, pursuing a sustainable progress that leaves no one behind and leaving a better planet to future generations.\n\nBeing Open Power means facing some of the biggest world challenges by combining sustainability and innovation. Open Power means unleashing access to energy; our mission is to connect an increasing number of people to secure and sustainable energy, opening up to new technologies and partnerships, new uses and ways to manage energy itself, while respecting our fundamental values: trust, responsibility, innovation and proactiveness.\n\nOur business model is the growth engine. We are active along the full value chain through Business Lines having each a specific focus. We are the world\u2019s largest private operator in the renewable energy sector with 53.6 GW\\(^1\\) of net efficient renewable capacity, equal to 63.3% of the entire generation capacity (Enel Green Power and Thermal Generation). We are the largest private electricity distribution company in the world (Enel Grids), with approximately 72.7 million end users connected to our networks, including 45.8 million with active smart meters. We also manage the largest customer base of any private company (Enel X Global Retail), with approximately 66.7 million customers. In order to increasingly promote electrification of uses, we develop and sell new services and products (e-Mobility Enel X Way), like electric mobility public charging point that currently exceed 22.6 thousand. To guarantee a stable energy supply, we operate in more than 30 countries in wholesale energy markets, and this ensures strategic and sustainable services to our customers (Global Energy & Commodity Management).\n\nBusiness is supported by the Global Service Functions (Procurement, Digital Solutions and Global Customer Operations) and Staff Functions (Administration, Finance and Control, Innovation and Sustainability, People and Organization, Communications, Legal and Corporate Affairs, Audit), with every Country combining the global business models with specific local requirements.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) If we include managed renewable capacity and BESS in 2022, 59 GW of installed capacity or 66% of total capacity was reached.\nEvery day our commitment is to develop a just and inclusive transition that creates value wherever we operate. We work jointly with our stakeholders (Enel people, suppliers and financial and commercial partners, communities in the areas of influence of our operations, our customers, the financial community, institutions, media, business and sector associations) since we are aware that we belong to the territory and we are an essential element in the lives of people, business and society at large. We strive to combine our industrial objectives with the socio-economic development of our areas of operation, building solid and positive relationships to achieve sustainable and long-lasting outcome. We engage our stakeholders by leveraging the Open Power approach as defined both in our Code of Ethics and in our Human Rights Policy, and walking the talk through several solid initiatives. A continuous dialog with the individual stakeholders and with the organizations that represent them, which is summarized also in the results of the materiality analysis process that allows us to identify the priority actions and our contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n| Stakeholders | 2022 | INPUT | 2022 | OUTPUT |\n|--------------|------|-------|------|--------|\n| **Planet**   |      |       |      |        |\n| TWh Net electricity generation | 227.8 | 229 gCO\u2082eq/kWh | Intensity of GHG Scope 1 emissions relating to power generation |\n| Total specific freshwater withdrawal | 0.23 (l/kWh) | 218 gCO\u2082eq/kWh | Intensity of GHG Scope 1 and 3 emissions relating to Integrated Power |\n| Water withdrawal in water stressed areas | 19.3% | 22.9 MtCO\u2082eq | Scope 3 emissions (gas retail) |\n| Projects for the protection of species and natural habitats | 200 No. | 0.07 g/kWh | Specific emissions of SO\u2082 |\n| Total direct fuel consumption | 26.5 Mtep | 0.32 g/kWh | Specific emissions of NO\u2093 |\n| **Enel people** | 65,124 No. | 6.8% | Turnover |\n| Proportion of women managers to total managers | 24.9% | 0.56 | Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate |\n| Proportion of women middle managers to total middle managers | 32.6% | 47.4 average training hours per employee |\n| **Community** | 1,527 No. | 15.6 mil | Beneficiaries \u2013 Access to clean and affordable energy |\n| Applications of the shared value creation model (CSV) | | 4.9 mil | Beneficiaries \u2013 Decent work and economic growth |\n| | | 3.7 mil | Beneficiaries \u2013 Quality education |\n| | | 4,778 mil \u20ac | Total Tax Borne |\n| | | 95.7% | Cooperative Compliance Index |\n| **Suppliers** | 172,854 No. | 99% | Suppliers qualified for ESG aspects |\n| Suppliers (FTE) | | 62% | Supplies value covered by CFP certification |\n| Active suppliers | 20,435 No. | 0.48 | Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate |\n| **Customers** | 45.8 mil | 321 TWh | Electricity sold |\n| End users with active smart meters | 37% | 212 No./10k customers | Commercial claims |\n| Digital clients | 22.6 thousand No. | 231 min | SAIDI |\n| Owned public charging points | | 0.7 mil | Beneficiaries of new connections in rural and suburban areas |\n| **Partners** | 10 No. | 194 No. | Proof of Concept |\n| Innovation hubs | | 60 No. | Solutions adopted in the business |\n| | | 43 No. | Partnership agreements for innovation |\n| **Financial community** | 60,068 mil \u20ac | 0.40 \u20ac/share | Fixed dividend per share (DPS) |\n| Net financial debt | 63% | 3.3% | Cost of gross debt |\n| Sustainable sources of financing on total | 81.8% | 56.7% | EBITDA related to business activities aligned with the European Taxonomy Regulation |\n\n(1) An application is interpreted as the use of at least one CSV instrument in relation to an asset, in any phase of the chain of value and in any Business Line.

For more information, see the 2022 Sustainability Report and the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement. The figure for 2021 has been adjusted on the basis of more accurate information.\n\nThe economic value generated and distributed directly by Enel provides a useful indication of how the Group has created wealth for all stakeholders. The increase in the economic value generated directly and the operating costs was caused mainly by the increase in the average prices and intermediate volumes of energy commodities, in particular gas and electricity. The payments to capital lenders are increasing essentially due to the increase in interest expense, mainly related to the increase in the interest rates following the restrictive monetary policies that were implemented to face the growing inflationary pressure.\nOur strategy for sustainable progress\n\nThe strategy developed in recent years has enabled the Group to set out a vision of the future and progress centered on sustainability as a key factor in addressing the global challenges of the transition to a decarbonized economy.\n\nA sustainable strategy and an integrated business model that enable us to contribute to achieving all 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nIn particular, 4 of the 17 goals guide our creation of value:\n\n- SDG 13 \u201cClimate Action\u201d;\n- SDG 7 \u201cAffordable and Clean Energy\u201d;\n- SDG 9 \u201cIndustry, Innovation and Infrastructure\u201d;\n- SDG 11 \u201cSustainable Cities and Communities\u201d.\n### SDG 13.2\nIntegrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning\n\n**The focus of our contribution**\n\nEnel\u2019s decarbonization roadmap covers both direct and indirect emissions along the Group\u2019s entire value chain, and consists of four targets certified by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), in line with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\n- Development of new RES capacity to have 100% renewable generation facilities by 2040\n- Exit from coal-/fired generation by 2027 and gas-/fired generation by 2040\n- Exit from gas retail by 2040, 100% sales from RES by 2040\n- Enel Capex Plan fully aligned with the target\n\n**Our actions**\n\n- Reduction in GHG Scope 1 emissions intensity relating to power generation\\(^1\\) by 80% in 2030 vs 2017\n- Reduction of GHG emissions intensity Scopes 1 and 3 relating to Integrated Power\\(^1\\) by 78% in 2030 vs 2017\n- Reduction in absolute GHG Scope 3 emissions relating to Gas Retail by 55% in 2030 vs 2017\n- >80% of investments (Capex) planned for 2023-2025 aligned with the European Taxonomy Regulation\n\n- 21 GW additional renewable capacity in the period 2023-2025, of which ~4 GW Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\n- 70% energy production from renewable sources in 2025\n- Improve service quality by reducing the average duration of system interruptions: SAIDI ~150 min. in 2025\n- Improve demand response solutions 12.4 GW in 2025\n- Achieve 48.3 mil users with active smart meters in 2025\n- Instal 31.4 thousand owned public charging points in 2025\n- Serve approximately 13 thousand electric buses in 2025\n- Manage 3.3 mil lighting points (street lighting) in 2025\n- 4,000 municipalities connected on the YoUrban platform in 2025\n- 352 MW storage behind the meter in 2025\n\n**Our goals**\n\n- Improve service quality by reducing the average duration of system interruptions: SAIDI ~150 min. in 2025\n- Improve demand response solutions 12.4 GW in 2025\n- Achieve 48.3 mil users with active smart meters in 2025\n- Instal 31.4 thousand owned public charging points in 2025\n- Serve approximately 13 thousand electric buses in 2025\n- Manage 3.3 mil lighting points (street lighting) in 2025\n- 4,000 municipalities connected on the YoUrban platform in 2025\n- 352 MW storage behind the meter in 2025\n\n\\(^1\\) Values of reduction percentages were calculated on an equal perimeter basis, and take into account the 2017 baseline from which GHG emissions from disposed assets from 2017-2022 are excluded, in accordance with SBTi.\nThe Sustainability Plan: our commitment\n\nOur sustainability strategy is embodied in our Sustainability Plan, defined taking into account the results of the materiality analysis, in synergy with the Strategic Plan, and translated into specific short-, medium- and long-term goals in order to ensure the transparency and verifiability of our journey towards sustainable progress. Every year, these objectives are updated in accordance with a process of continuous alignment with the business strategies, with the results achieved and best practices in order to increasingly integrate sustainability along the entire value chain.\n\nAt the heart of our sustainability strategy is our ambition to achieve zero emissions by 2040, thanks to a sustainable business model based on the development of generation from renewable sources and facilitated by the security and reliability of the grid and the clean electrification of consumption. In all our activities, we always take into account the needs of our stakeholders. In this context, innovation, digitalization, circular economy and sustainable finance act across all sectors and accelerate growth. A pathway of sustainable growth that is taken in respect of nature and of human rights, with the support of a sound governance structure.\n\nThe Sustainability Plan 2023-2025 reinforces our decarbonization commitment, considering all Group emissions and confirming our commitment to achieving \u201cNo Net Loss\u201d in terms of biodiversity in the development of new infrastructure from 2030, focusing in particular on areas of high biodiversity importance, with respect to forest conservation and the preservation of protected areas. A new objective was defined related to the overall well-being of Enel people, as a factor enabling the development of innovation potential.\nOur commitment to sustainability\n\nElisabetta Ripa\nGlobal E-Mobility\n\n\u2018Enel X Way has adopted an integrated sustainable business approach.

In the coming years, the focus will be on sustainable coding to ensure greater quality, safety and inclusiveness\u2019.\n\nOur strategy for sustainable progress\nAt the center of Enel\u2019s sustainability strategy lies the **ambition to achieve zero emissions in 2040**, in line with the goal of limiting global warming to below 1.5 \u00b0C. Specific targets, validated by SBTi (Science Based Targets initiative), have been defined, covering both direct emissions generated by our plants and indirect upstream and downstream emissions produced by our suppliers and customers.\n\n### 2030\n\n- **-80%** reduction of GHG Scope 1 emissions intensity relating to power generation (compared to 2017)\n- **-78%** reduction of GHG Scope 1 and 3 emissions intensity relating to Integrated Power (compared to 2017)\n- **-55%** reduction of absolute GHG Scope 3 emissions relating to Gas Retail (compared to 2017)\n\n### 2023-2025\n\n- **>80%** of investments (Capex) planned for 2023-2025 aligned with the European Taxonomy\n\n**PROJECT: ADAPTATION: A CLIMATE-PROOF FUTURE**\n\n---\n\n(2) The values of the reduction percentages have been calculated on an equal perimeter basis, and take into account the 2017 baseline, which excludes GHG emissions from assets disposed in the 2017-2022 period, in accordance with SBTi.\nClean electrification\n\nThe transition to decarbonization is supported by the growing development of renewable energies, reaching 53.6 GW\\(^3\\) of installed capacity in 2022, and by the phase-out of coal-fired generation by 2027 and gas-fired by 2040. It is also supported by an approach to innovation as an accelerator in the creation of sustainable value, an example of which is the construction of the 3SUN Gigafactory photovoltaic panel plant in Catania.\n\nThe extension and digitalization of the grids, which have 72.7 million end users, make it possible to accommodate greater volumes of energy produced from renewable sources and to offer an increasingly high-quality, secure and reliable service. One of the main objectives in this regard is strengthening our commitment to reducing the average frequency (SAIFI) and duration (SAIDI) of interruptions of electricity supply. Furthermore, we are committed to further extending access to electricity in rural and suburban areas in the countries in which we operate, to communities with no electricity supply, aiming to reach 7.1 million beneficiaries by 2030.\n\nBy offering new, innovative and inclusive products and services, we can accompany our customers on their journey to clean electrification and the transformation of their energy habits in everyday life. We are able to do this through network flexibility and consumption optimization services such as demand response,\\(^4\\) but also by bringing energy ever closer to our customers, for example through the development of energy communities.\\(^5\\) We also continue supporting the spread of electric mobility, expecting to reach 31,400 owned public charging points in 2025 (22,600 in 2022), as well as serving around 13,000 electric buses (over 5,000 in 2022).\n\n---\n\n\\(^3\\) Including managed renewable capacity and BESS in 2022, 59 GW of installed capacity or 66% of total capacity was reached.\n\n\\(^4\\) A digital platform service open to commercial and industrial customers that enables greater network flexibility and stability and more efficient use of infrastructure and energy resources by optimizing consumption.\n\n\\(^5\\) An energy community consists of an association of citizens, businesses, local governments and small/medium-sized enterprises that decide to join forces with the aim of producing, trading and consuming energy from renewable sources on a local scale.\nThe value of the relationships we establish with our stakeholders is a core focus of our commitment to achieve a just transition, focusing on those most exposed in the transition to a decarbonized economy. We promote specific resettlement programs supported by upskilling and reskilling activities and we are committed to dedicating 40% of the total training fund to these programs in 2025. We support our suppliers on this new journey to repurpose their resources and skills and we develop projects and activities at a local level with the communities involved in the transition process.\n\nFor the people who work at the Company, we are also committed on a daily basis to building an inclusive working environment in which diversity and uniqueness are valued and individual development is encouraged, including through the further extension and diversification of the training offer. Our attention is increasingly focused on the well-being of our people and on enabling their engagement and innovative potential: in pursuing this direction, a new goal related to the overall well-being of Enel people has been defined. Women in the company account for 23.4% of the total, thanks to a special focus on gender diversity, which also in a broader, cultural and generational sense, aims to enhance resources even before they join the company and throughout all people management processes.\n\nOur suppliers are indispensable for us to enhance sustainable progress and realize the process of transformation of the energy and digital system, encouraging them to commit to a sustainable path. The basis of our purchasing processes is loyalty, transparency and collaboration, and we ask our suppliers not only to guarantee the quality standards required, but also to commit to adopting best practices in terms of human rights and of the impact of their activity on the environment. This commitment is translated into concrete actions: at the qualification stage, when assessing suppliers based on social and environmental factors, when requesting certifications at the tender stage, or in the application of rankings and/or targets concerning the carbon footprint of suppliers.\nResponsible relations with the communities where we operate aim to promote economic and social development through sustainability projects. From the expansion of infrastructure to professional education and training programs, as well as projects that support cultural and economic activities and promote access to energy, rural and suburban electrification, tackling energy poverty and promoting social inclusion for the more vulnerable categories.\n\nRead more...\n\nGrowth accelerators\n\nInnovation, circular economy, digitalization and sustainable finance are the growth accelerators of Enel\u2019s sustainability strategy that embrace and enhance all strategic themes crosswise.\n\nWe constantly work on innovation and foster open collaboration with our partners, including start-ups, SMEs, large companies, academia, internal and external experts, and investors. A widespread culture of Innovability\u00ae (innovation and sustainability) means that the whole Company aims to renew itself continually, thereby ensuring its survival in the long term. We constantly strive to find innovative solutions to support environmental protection but also to create more socially inclusive conditions.\n\nRead more...\n\n2015\u20132030\n\n5 million beneficiaries of the projects to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education (SDG 4)\n\n20 million beneficiaries of projects to provide access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy (SDG 7)\n\n8 million beneficiaries of projects to promote sustained, lasting, inclusive and sustainable economic growth (SDG 8)\n\nPROJECT: RUTA PEHUENCHE\n\n2023\u20132025\n\nScale-up of 126 solutions in the business\n\nLaunch of 445 Proof of Concept to test innovative solutions\n\nPROJECT: NET ZERO GRID\nFor years, we have been constantly rethinking how we do things with a circular economy approach, focusing on innovation not only in technology, but also in business models, involving the entire value chain. Adopting a circular and sustainable model as an integral part of the energy transition process also allows us to lower our dependence on raw materials, particularly on \u201ccritical\u201d raw materials, ensuring not only the competitiveness of the business model, but also full social and environmental sustainability across the chain. Suffice to look at the increasing attention to raw materials, the basis for the production of solar panels and batteries, a major focus considering the topic of their scarcity compared to demand.\n\nFinally, the energy transition process cannot disregard aspects such as digitalization and cyber security, through which the Group is committed to disseminating the most advanced solutions and to strengthening verification activities in order to prevent possible cyber attacks (Ethical Hacking, Vulnerability Assessment).\n\nThe importance of sustainable finance is growing to accelerate the achievement of the 2030 Agenda goals, through investments that link financial strategy to the Company\u2019s sustainability goals. At Enel, sustainable finance plays a crucial role in supporting the growth of the Group, accounting for 63% of the gross debt at the end of 2022 and contributing to a gradual reduction in the cost of debt, through the recognition of the value of sustainability. Furthermore, 92% of investments (Capex) in 2022 were aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n---\n\n(6) The circularity improvement index measures lower material and fuel consumption of the Group\u2019s plants throughout their life cycle compared to 2015.\n\n(7) The \u201cEconomic CirculAbility\u00a9\u201d KPI considers the Group\u2019s overall EBITDA (euros) and compares it with the amount of resources consumed, both fuel and raw materials, by the different business activities (tons).\nProtecting natural capital and biodiversity, tackling climate change, and contributing to sustainable economic development are strategic factors in the planning, operation and development of our activities. From the perspective of the energy and digital transformation process, mitigating the effects of increasing environmental degradation and climate change cannot be achieved without taking into account their social impact and the principles of inclusion and equity. In particular, this translates into an everyday commitment to the conservation and preservation of nature and biodiversity, by reducing and mitigating the potential negative effects on the planet that may result from various Group activities, to protect current and future generations.\n\nThe environmental strategy is also strengthened by a circularity approach, which focuses on reducing the consumption of non-renewable resources and maximizing the value of those already used and of the goods produced, by integrating sustainability from the design phase to the decommissioning of plants, also through innovative solutions.\n\nIn this context, we have defined specific targets related to the reduction of emissions (including SO\u2082, NO\u2093), freshwater withdrawal through responsible use of water resources and waste generated through a structured management system. We have also committed to achieving No Net Loss in terms of biodiversity for new infrastructures from 2030, commencing its adoption on selected projects in areas of high biodiversity importance starting from 2025.\nHuman rights\n\nOur commitment to human rights is reflected in an integrated, cross-cutting approach that takes into account the needs of our stakeholders along the entire value chain. In this way, we promote knowledge and the growth of a constructive dialogue that can really help to effectively address the challenges in terms of the social impact of a decarbonized economy.\n\nThe protection of health and safety for all those who work with and for us is a shared responsibility at every level, through the integration of safety in processes and training, in the relationship with contractors, in the management and analysis of accidents and in the continuous quality controls.\n\nUnderpinning the business processes and activities in which we are engaged is a sound governance framework, which enables to guarantee our stakeholders the application of transparency, fairness and integrity principles in support of our business model and its implementation on a daily basis, as well as of our entire sustainability strategy.\n\nIn the 2022 Sustainability Report, an overview of all the objectives in the 2023-2025 Sustainability Plan is provided at the beginning of each chapter, in the dashboards. For example, the dashboard header represents the link between the material topics, the issues in the Sustainability Plan and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, to which the objectives related to the specific issue contribute directly. Each dashboard then presents in detail the 2022 results related to the targets of the previous 2022-2024 Sustainability Plan, the resulting progress and the targets of the 2023-2025 Sustainability Plan, which may be redefined, added to, or surpassed with respect to the previous Plan.\n\n-1%\n\nInjuries with absence from work frequency rate compared to the previous year(8)\n\nPROJECT: ROBOTS AND SAFETY\n\nInjuries with absence from work frequency rate compared to the previous year(8)\n\nPROJECT: ROBOTS AND SAFETY\n\nIn the 2022 Sustainability Report, an overview of all the objectives in the 2023-2025 Sustainability Plan is provided at the beginning of each chapter, in the dashboards.

In line with GRI, the target reported here takes into account calculation methods that are slightly different from what has been included in Chief Executive Officer\u2019s short-term variable compensation, reported in the Report on Remuneration Policy.\nOur governance of sustainability\n\nOur governance structure is inspired by international best practices in terms of independence, transparency, inclusiveness and accountability, and permeates the various strategic and operational processes at all levels of the Company, ensuring effective and efficient management of activities in line with the Company\u2019s purpose and values.\n\nIntegrating sustainability into company strategy and processes\n\nFor us, sustainability is an essential part of our company processes and lies at the heart of our strategy to meet the global challenges of the transition to a decarbonized economy. This integration is possible thanks to structured processes throughout the Group, starting with an analysis of the context and macro-trends that allows us to assess economic, social and environmental challenges, analyze the associated risks and seize the relative opportunities. This in turn allows us to understand the context in which we operate, supporting our growth and our path towards sustainable progress. Context analysis is therefore crucial in order to identify the actual and potential impact of our activities, as well as serving as a guide in the definition and planning of our short-, medium- and long-term targets, which are realized through the implementation of specific actions and the development of projects and initiatives in support of our sustainability strategy. Every stage of this process relies on respect for human rights as a fundamental element in the pursuit of sustainable success.\nA key element of the approach described is the adoption of the ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) indicators throughout the entire value chain, not only to report the results achieved, but above all to anticipate decisions and guide our actions. We are constantly committed to managing and measuring our performance on all relevant aspects, considering economic, business and ESG issues in reporting on activities and defining the objectives underlying the strategy. This model is fully in line with the requirements of the United Nations\u2019 Global Compact, of which Enel has been an active member since 2004, which stress the importance of ever-increasing integration of sustainability throughout all corporate strategies.\n\nIn 2022, we also officially launched our ENEL STAKECAP\u2122 model, proposing the adoption of new financial metrics to represent the creation and distribution of sustainable value to the different categories of stakeholders with whom we establish a quality relationship, measured using ESG metrics.\n\nOur commitment to transparent and robust reporting of our performance on all ESG aspects is essential in order for us to ensure access to information for all our stakeholders, as well as for ESG rating agency assessments to support investors in assessing the sustainability of our business model.\n\nA commitment evidenced by our active participation in various international and European contexts in initiatives and actions to develop and revise frameworks and standards for measuring corporate sustainability, including the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG)\u2019s drafting of the European sustainability reporting standards. Please refer to the \u201cOur participation in ESG standards/frameworks and sustainability networks\u201d paragraph for further details in this chapter.\n\nThe Enel governance model for sustainability\n\nEnel\u2019s organizational and corporate governance model ensures that sustainability issues are appropriately taken into consideration in all relevant company decision-making processes, by defining specific tasks and responsibilities for the main corporate governance bodies.\n\nThe Board of Directors plays a central role in corporate governance as the body vested with powers related to the strategic, organizational and control policies of the Company and Group, and pursues the sustainable success of the same. In this context, the Board of Directors takes into account the need to pursue sustainable success particularly: (i) when defining Company and Group strategies; (ii) when drawing up the remuneration policy for the Chief Executive Officer/General Manager and Key Management Personnel, defining specific sustainability objectives the achievement of which is linked to a significant component of the variable pay; and (iii) with regard to the Company\u2019s Internal Control and Risk Management System (\u201cSCIGR\u201d), aimed at the effective and efficient identification, measurement, management and monitoring of the main corporate risks, including those of an ESG nature.\n\nEnel applies diversity criteria, also in relation to gender, in the composition of the Board of Directors, in line with the priority goal of ensuring adequate competence and professionalism of its members and in compliance with its Diversity Policy, approved in 2018. The Board of Directors, whose term expires with the approval of the financial statements for the 2022 financial year, in providing shareholders with its guidance on the optimal size and composition of the Board of Directors, with a view to its renewal by the Ordinary Shareholders\u2019 Meeting scheduled for May 2023, expressly took into account the criteria set out in the Diversity Policy. These guidelines, which include sustainability among the competencies deemed relevant, are summarized in a special document that was published in good time on the Company\u2019s website in anticipation of the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting called to renew the Board.\n\nIn order to provide Directors with an adequate overview of the Group\u2019s business sectors, including sustainability issues, a comprehensive induction program was organized commencing in the second half of 2020, followed by specific examination of the topics of corporate governance and climate change during 2021. During 2022, the induction program continued with further examination of the topics of cyber security and risk governance.\n\nFurthermore, in order to regulate the way in which the Company engages with institutional investors and with all shareholders and bond holders, in March 2021 the Board of Directors adopted a specific Policy (called \u2018Engagement Policy\u2019). In this regard, during 2022, the Company maintained an ongoing dialogue with institutional investors, also with reference to certain profiles concerning sustainability, with a particular focus on climate change.\n\nThe Board of Directors has also established internal board committees with the power to investigate, propose and advise, in order to ensure an adequate internal division of its functions, as well as a related parties committee. In particular, the following committees have been established:\n\u2022 Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, which among other things assists the Board of Directors on sustainability issues, including issues relating to climate change and the dynamics of the Company\u2019s interaction with all stakeholders. More specifically, with regard to sustainability issues, the Committee examines: (i) the guidelines of the Sustainability Plan and the materiality matrix \u2013 which identifies the material topics for stakeholders in light of the Enel Group\u2019s industrial strategies \u2013 periodically assessing achievement of the objectives defined in the Plan itself; (ii) the way in which the sustainability policy is implemented; (iii) the general outline and structure of the content in the Non-Financial Statement and the Sustainability Report, which may be summarized in a single document. In 2022, it addressed sustainability issues in 4 of the 6 meetings held.\n\n\u2022 Control and Risks Committee, which is tasked, among other things, with supporting the assessments and decisions of the Board of Directors relating to the SCIGR, also with regard to risks that may be relevant from a sustainability perspective, and to the approval of periodic financial and non-financial reports. During 2022 it dealt with sustainability issues in 8 of the 14 meetings held;\n\n\u2022 Nomination and Compensation Committee, which is tasked, among other things, with supporting the Board of Directors in its assessments and decisions relating to the size and optimal composition of the Board itself and its Committees, as well as the remuneration of Directors and Key Management Personnel. In this regard, the remuneration policy for 2022 provides for specific sustainability targets the achievement of which is linked to a significant component of the variable pay of the Chief Executive Officer/General Manager;\n\n\u2022 Related Parties Committee, which performs the tasks required by the CONSOB regulations and by the specific Enel procedure governing transactions with related parties. Furthermore, in line with the power structure currently in force within the Company:\n\n\u2022 the Chairman of the Board of Directors acts as a link between the executive and non-executive directors and is responsible for ensuring the effective operation of the board; he also plays a proactive role in the process of approving and monitoring corporate and sustainability strategies;\n\n\u2022 the Chief Executive Officer is primarily responsible for the management of the Company and acts as the director in charge of the establishment and maintenance of the SCIGR. Also, in exercising the powers granted, he has defined a sustainable business model by identifying a strategy aimed at guiding the energy transition to a low carbon model;\n\n\u2022 the Innovability\u00ae Function (Innovation and Sustainability), which reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer, manages all activities relating to sustainability and innovation. The Holding units responsible for Enel S.p.A.\u2019s operations, particularly the sustainability, circular economy, and community relations processes, play a guidance and coordination role for the Sustainability and Innovation units located in the various countries and Business Lines. In particular, the Holding\u2019s Sustainability Planning and Performance Management and Human Rights unit, responsible for the management of sustainability planning, monitoring and reporting processes, including compliance with the European taxonomy, as well as the management of ESG ratings, sustainability indices and the Human Rights Policy, also reports to the Group\u2019s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), in order to ensure the ever-greater integration of these issues into corporate strategies and corporate reporting;\n\n\u2022 the Global Business Lines, Countries, Global Service Functions and Holding Functions integrate ESG factors into their decision-making and operating processes, to create long-term sustainable value, thanks to the presence of dedicated Sustainability structures in all Countries, Business Lines and Global Service Functions. At the local level, the expectations of the various stakeholders are identified, and specific sustainability plans defined, in line with the Group strategy. With specific reference to governance for the management of climate change, please refer to the \u201cZero emissions target\u201d chapter of this document.\n\nFurthermore, the Group CEO chairs the Cyber Security Committee, which consists of the Group\u2019s front line and the purpose of which is to approve the IT security strategy and periodically check the progress of its implementation. For more information on the activities carried out by the corporate bodies, please refer to the Enel Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structure available at www.enel.com, governance section, as well as the chapter on \u201cSound Governance\u201d in this document.\nOur participation in ESG standards/frameworks and in sustainable development organizations\n\n1. Global Reporting Initiative\n\nThe Enel Group has been a member of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) since 2006, and part of the GRI Community since 2018. In 2022 Enel continued to engage with the other members of the Global Sustainability Standards Board and played an active role in completing the work of the \u201cBusiness Leadership Forum on the SDGs\u201d, once again confirming its efforts to support the SDGs, while demonstrating commitment, accountability and transparency through corporate reporting. Since 2020, Enel has been part of the Global Sustainability Standards Board, the independent body that has the exclusive responsibility for developing and issuing the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards.\n\n2. IFRS Sustainability Alliance\n\nEven following the initial merger of IIRC and SASB into the Value Reporting Foundation, and then into the current IFRS Sustainability Alliance, in 2022 Enel continued to engage with the new organization to promote transparent, reliable and comparable reporting on environmental, social and governance issues.\n\n3. Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n\nEnel has supported the Taskforce since the publication of the first recommendations in June 2017, promoting transparent and reliable information on the climate.

Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)\n\nEnel has certified through SBTi four targets, referring to both direct and indirect emissions along the entire value chain, with respect to the 2030 and 2040 horizons, in line with 1.5 \u00b0C and the criteria and recommendations of SBTi and its reference standards.\n\n5. Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Forum\n\nIn 2022, Enel continued to collaborate as a member of the TNFD Forum, a multi-stakeholder advisory group that supports the new Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosure (TNFD) to provide a global framework by 2023 for companies and financial institutions to assess and report risks and opportunities linked to their operations\u2019 impact on nature and biodiversity. In October 2022, Enel was also selected as one of the companies that are part of TNFD Pilot Program, which will test the new TNFD framework under the WBCSD\u2019s guidance as part of three groups (energy, land use and built environment).\n\n6. Science Based Target Network (SBTN) for Nature\n\nAfter joining the Science Based Target Network\u2019s Corporate Engagement Program in 2021, Enel again committed to SBTN\u2019s goals and vision, and helped develop methods and tools in line with its targets. SBTN \u2013 a unique collaboration of not-for-profit and world-leading organizations \u2013 provides companies with guidance to set science-based goals for nature, water, oceans, land and biodiversity.\n\n7. United Nations Global Compact\n\nIn 2004 Enel joined the United Nations Global Compact by committing to its ten founding principles on human rights, labor standards, environmental protection and anti-corruption. In 2022, Enel continued to be part of the \u201cCFO Coalition for the SDGs\u201d, which it co-chairs, and sits on the new Advisory Board. Enel is also a member of the Just Transition Think Lab and a Patron of the new Transformational Governance portfolio, an initiative to explore new decision-making models to help companies be more responsible, ethical, inclusive and transparent. The Group also took part in Uniting Business LIVE organized by the Global Compact during the UN General Assembly week.\n\n8. Sustainable Energy for All\n\nSince 2011, Enel has been a partner of Sustainable Energy for All, an international organization that works in collaboration with the United Nations and global leaders in the public and private sector to advance SDG 7. Since 2020, the Group CEO has chaired the organization\u2019s Administrative Board, a position it will hold up until 2023. Enel upheld its commitment to the Energy Compacts in 2022: in addition to the Group\u2019s Energy Compact and that for the green electrification of Sardinia launched in 2021, the Group presented the Santiago Energy Compact to boost photovoltaic capacity and promote end-use electrification in the city of Santiago de Chile, helping to further progress on SDG 7 as reported in the 2022 Annual Progress Report. In 2022 Enel also took part in the SEforALL Forum held in Kigali from May 17 to 19.\nEnel has been a member of CSR Europe since 2005. From 2016 to 2020, the Group served as vice-chair of the Board (of which it is currently a member) and was re-elected in 2022 for a further three-year term. Enel also joined the organization\u2019s new flagship initiative \u2013 the \u201cLeaders Hub for an Inclusive Green Deal\u201d \u2013 which focuses on a just transition for an inclusive Green Deal, where Enel has been engaged in the Steering Committee and workforce, communities and consumers working groups. The Group also played a key role in the European SDG Summit where the various working groups in which Enel took part presented their results.\n\n- Business Roadmap for Just Transition of the People Leaders Hub;\n- Building Inclusive Workplaces Blueprint, outcome of the People Centered Approach workshops;\n- Upskilling & Reskilling Report of the Upskill4Future Project launched in 2021.\n\nThe Group also continued its work on the Biodiversity & Industry platform. Lastly, we entered into a dialog to develop a performance indicator for companies on tax transparency and responsible tax behavior, and participated in the working group to draw up a blueprint and paper on composite raw materials.\n\nSince 2016, Enel has been a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and is represented both on the Board (of which the CEO is a member), and at Liaison Delegate level. In 2022, the Group continued to be involved in multiple programs and projects, including SOS 1.5 and Energy Transformation, for which it is also a member of the Steering Committee. Enel also joined the new Business Commission to Tackle Inequality initiative, of which Chairman Cristostomo serves as Commissioner. The Group has also played an active role in the following projects: \u201cHealthy People, Healthy Business\u201d, \u201cNature-based solutions\u201d and \u201cMobility Decarbonization\u201d. During the WBCSD Council Meeting, Enel was engaged in the dialogue on Business priorities for the global stocktake and Towards zero-emission mobility & buildings operations.\n\nIn 2016, Enel joined the Sustainable Business Roundtable (SBRT) and in 2022 it participated in meetings focusing on \u201cThe Board\u2019s Role in Sustainability\u201d and \u201cCreating Sustainable Customer Value\u201d.\n\nIn 2022, Enel continued to uphold its commitment to the Global Investors for Sustainable Development (GISD) Alliance, an integral part of the UN Strategy for Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, of which the Group\u2019s CEO is a member. Enel has been an active contributor in the Alliance\u2019s discussions on mobilizing investments in support of sustainable development, particularly in defining specific industry metrics related to the SDGs and their integration into existing reporting frameworks.\n\nIn 2022, Enel confirmed its participation in the Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative as an Official Supporter, and expressed its interest in participating in the new Advisory Board dedicated to Voluntary Carbon Markets.\n\nIn early 2023, Enel joined the World Climate Foundation, a multi-stakeholder and multi-sector network to promote the transition to a zero-emission and nature-positive planet through multilateral dialogue and partnerships, as well as investment in sustainable solutions.\nOur materiality analysis and priorities for action\n\nConsidering the analysis of the ESG context, the materiality analysis process, via the involvement of stakeholders and relevant experts, makes it possible to define the material topics, that is the topics that represent the organization\u2019s most significant impacts on the economy, environment and people, including impacts on human rights. The material topics are our action priorities based on which we define the sustainability goals targeted toward creating sustainable short, medium and long-term value and the content to be included in the documents that comprise Corporate Reporting.\n\nThe materiality analysis process framework\n\nContext analysis\nIdentification and analysis of key ESG megatrends, current and future, to identify their risks, limit their impacts, and fully grasp their related opportunities\n\nWe involve our stakeholders and relevant experts\n\nPriorities\u2019 Matrix\nIdentification and assessment of priority topics for the Company (Y-axis) and its key stakeholders (X-axis) representing the Group\u2019s\n\nDouble materiality\nIdentification of material topics based on the assessment of the impacts generated and impacts suffered (impact materiality and financial materiality)\n\nPRIORITIES\u2019 MATERIALITY\nUnderstanding the context in which the Company operates\nIdentification of topics (1st, 2nd, 3rd level)\nIdentification of the stakeholders (Levels I, II, III)\nAssignment of relevance to stakeholders\nAssignment of priority to the topics by external stakeholders\nAssignment of priority to the topics by Company strategies\nAssessment of priority to the topics\n\nDOUBLE MATERIALITY\nUnderstanding the context in which the Company operates\nAnalysis on the impacts of key ESG trends\nAssignment of priority to the topics by external stakeholders\nDefinition of the list of impacts\nAnalysis of impacts\nPrioritization of the most significant impacts\n\nmanaged through the digital system e-mia\u00ae\nEnel performs the materiality analysis based on the most widespread international standards, including the Universal Standard GRI 2021 (Global Reporting Initiative), AA1000 (Accountability 1000) and taking into consideration the new requirements introduced on a European level by the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the Exposure Drafts of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) made available by EFRAG (European Financial Reporting Advisory Group). The Value Reporting Foundation \u2013 SASB and Compass SDG, which supports companies in adapting their strategies to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, were also considered.\n\nOver the past two years, the perspective for identifying the priorities attributed by the Company and its stakeholders to ESG topics has been enriched by the view of the most significant generated and incurred impacts for the Company (the so-called Double materiality \u2013 impact materiality and financial materiality). From the point of view of \u201cdouble materiality\u201d, the impact model is of fundamental importance, because it makes it possible for the Company to identify the material topics and therefore concentrate on them in the best way possible, both in terms of risks as well as opportunities. Therefore if the analysis of the most significant impacts guides the identification of the material topics, the priority topics direct the Company\u2019s further efforts for following the strategic choices.\n\nThe materiality analysis process includes a significant activity of involving the stakeholders, which makes it possible to always be open to listening to the individuals or interest groups that are influenced or could be influenced by the organization\u2019s activities. Every year we start multiple types of initiatives in order to receive information about what is perceived by internal and external stakeholders in terms of priorities, satisfaction and impact of the submitted ESG topics.\n\nThe list of material topics (level I and II) is provided below.\n\nThe detailed information regarding the materiality analysis process and the activities for stakeholder involvement is provided in chapter \u201cMateriality analysis process and results for 2022\u201d of this document.\nOur commitment to continuous improvement\n\nSustainable investments\n\nSustainability represents a fundamental lever for creating economic and financial value. For this reason a consistent number of investors have integrated ESG issues in their investment portfolio over the past years in order to minimize financial risk and guarantee higher returns. Thanks to international development and growing profitability, together with a strong sustainability policy and strategy targeted toward energy transition, as well as the adoption of best practices regarding transparency and corporate governance, Enel shareholders include national and international investment funds, insurance companies, pension and ethical funds. Since 2014, ESG investment funds (active and passive) have more than doubled their share of Enel\u2019s share capital, reaching 14.9% at the end of 2022, up as compared to December 31, 2021 (14.6%). Their share of total institutional investors is also increasing, reaching 26.2% at the end of 2022, compared to 24.6% of the previous year. In absolute terms, 245 (vs 252 at the end of 2021) investors with investment funds consider not only the Group\u2019s financial performance but also the environmental, social and governance practices that Enel is integrating into its business strategy and all activities along the entire value chain. Furthermore, again at the end of 2022, 42.1% of Enel\u2019s capital was held by investors who were signatories of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI).\n\nGrowth in ESG investors\n\n| Year | ESG investors | Float | Share capital |\n|------|---------------|-------|---------------|\n| 2014 | 134           | 8.6%  | 5.9%          |\n| 2015 | 132           | 10.3% | 7.7%          |\n| 2016 | 150           | 10.5% | 8.0%          |\n| 2017 | 160           | 11.3% | 8.6%          |\n| 2018 | 169           | 10.5% | 10.5%         |\n| 2019 | 182           | 10.8% | 10.8%         |\n| 2020 | 19.1          | 14.6% | 14.6%         |\n| 2021 | 19.1          | 14.6% | 14.6%         |\n| 2022 | 19.4          | 14.9% | 14.9%         |\nSustainability-linked finance\n\nIn Enel, sustainable finance plays a crucial role in supporting Group growth, representing approximately 63% of gross debt at the end of 2022. In particular, structured transactions amounting to more than 23 billion euros equivalent were carried out.\n\nSustainable finance means synergy between private and public finance. Private finance conveys private capital towards sustainable investments, i.e. for the benefit of companies whose strategic action is intended to achieve certain sustainability objectives, reflecting the economic and financial value of sustainability in a lower cost of debt. Public finance, on the other hand, stimulates the creation of sustainable investments, through grants and loans at subsidized interest rates.\n\nIn 2020, Enel was the first company in the world to set up a \u201cSustainability-Linked Financing Framework\u201d, an all-encompassing document that extends the sustainability-linked approach to all financial debt instruments. Indicators, targets and principles have been defined that govern the development of sustainable finance throughout the Group with ambition and transparency, linking the financial strategy to the sustainability objectives. The \u201cSustainability-Linked Financing Framework\u201d was updated in January 2021, January 2022 and subsequently in February 2023, in line with the annual updates of the Group\u2019s Strategic Plan. In the last updated in February 2023, three new KPIs (\u201cScope 1 and 3 GHG emissions intensity relating to Integrated Power (gCO\u2082eq/kWh)\u201d, \u201cAbsolute Scope 3 GHG emissions relating to gas retail (MtCO\u2082eq)\u201d and \u201cProportion of Capex aligned to the EU Taxonomy (%\u201d) were included in the framework, which contribute toward reaching SDG 7 and SDG 13 and the European Environmental Objective of Climate Change Mitigation.\n\nThe Group\u2019s financial instruments and operations can therefore have an interest rate or other financial or structural terms linked to reaching the goals associated with the reduction in direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions (SDG 13 \u201cClimate action\u201d), the increase in installed capacity powered by renewable sources (SDG 7 \u201cAffordable and clean energy\u201d) and the percentage of total Capex, carried out during a certain period, in activities that are qualified as sustainable from an environmental point of view according to the criteria specified in article 3 of the regulation on EU Taxonomy (2020/852). The KPIs and targets included in the latest update of Enel\u2019s Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework, published in February 2023, are listed below.\n\n| KPI                                                                 | Actual values | Sustainability Performance Targets (SPT) |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|                                                                    | 2022          | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | 2030 | 2040 |\n| GHG Scope 1 emission intensity related to power generation (gCO\u2082eq/kWh) | 229           | 148  | 140  | 130  | 72   | 0    |\n| GHG Scope 1 and 3 emission intensity related to Integrated Power (gCO\u2082eq/kWh) | 218           | 135  | 73   | 0    |\n| Absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions relating to gas retail (MtCO\u2082eq)     | 22.9          | 20.9 | 11.4 | 0    |\n| Percentage of installed renewable capacity (%) (1)                 | 63.1%         | 60%  | 65%  | 66%  | 76%  | 85%  | 100% |\n| Proportion of Capex aligned to the EU Taxonomy (%)                  | 81.9%         | >80% |\n\n(1) Excluded from the calculation are 531.1 MW of acquired capacity, deriving from power plants acquired by the Group, according to what is indicated by the contractual documentation of the individual instruments.\n\nHaving achieved a percentage of renewable installed capacity of 63.1% of total installed capacity as of 2022, Enel has reached the target set in all those financial instruments in which the interest rate, or other financial or structural terms of the transaction, are linked to the achievement of a percentage of renewable installed capacity of 60% or more. Particularly noteworthy is the achievement of the targets set by the first sustainability-linked bonds issued by Enel Finance International NV (EFI) in 2020 in Pound Sterling. The trend of the five above-mentioned KPI, at the relative date of reference, will be verified by an external verifier. Furthermore, Enel will report every year on its performance regarding the five KPI, as appropriate, in its Annual Financial Statements and/or Sustainability Report \u2013 Non-Financial Statement and/or on its website.\n\nIn 2022 the Group, through its financial subsidiaries, EFI and, for the first time EFA (Enel Finance America, LLC), issued approximately 12 billion euros in sustainability-linked bonds in various markets and currencies.\n\n(9) https://www.enel.com/investors/investing/sustainable-finance/sustainability-linked-finance/sustainability-linked-bonds.\nFor this reason, it is worth recalling that in June 2022 EFI launched a multi-tranche bond emission on the market in US dollars and linked one of the trances to the Group\u2019s goal of reaching zero emissions of \u201cScope 1 GHG emissions intensity relating to power generation (gCO\u2082eq/kWh)\u201d by 2040. This was the first time ever for an energy multinational.\n\nIn May 2022, Enel and EFI increased the amount of the current Sustainability-Linked Revolving Credit Facility from 10 billion euros to 13.5 billion euros, the world\u2019s largest sustainable credit line linked to SDG 13.\n\nWith regard to commercial papers, in April 2022 EFI renewed and increased its commercial paper program from 6 to 8 billion euros, which is linked to KPI \u201cScope 1 GHG emissions intensity relating to power generation (gCO\u2082eq/kWh)\u201d of less than or equal to 148 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2023 and less than or equal to 140 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2024.\n\nFurthermore, Enel has signed agreements with different financial counterparties for derivative instruments and sustainable guarantees, both linked to the Group\u2019s ability to reach its sustainability goals over the next years.\n\nIn February 2023, EFI launched a sustainability-linked bond in two tranches for a total of 1.5 billion euros: the new issue combined for the first time worldwide a KPI linked to the taxonomy of EU with a KPI linked to the United Nations sustainable development goals (\u201cSDG\u201d), also providing for goals of complete decarbonization.\n\nIn the field of public finance, the Group supports the economic recovery plan and aims to become a strategic partner for the adoption of the Green Deal and the Recovery Plan at both the national and European level. The objective is to drive a sustainable, rapid and effective recovery, through a wide pipeline of construction projects focused on decarbonization, electricity grids and electrification, allowing the green and digital transition of the European economy to be accelerated, with a significant impact in terms of GDP, employment and reduction of CO\u2082 emissions and in full alignment with the European Taxonomy. To this end, the Group has identified potential investments of approximately 4.3 billion euros for the period 2023\u20132030, with a direct impact on the Group through the ownership and the stewardship model. These initiatives are focused on green hydrogen, renewables and storage, revitalization of the photovoltaic manufacturing industry, smart grids, network resilience and charging infrastructure for electric mobility. The Group has also promoted partnerships with both public and private entities, with a view to achieving the decarbonization and electrification of consumption through the spread of electric bus fleets, the transition towards green ports and the promotion of energy efficiency in public buildings.\n\nFurthermore, in the context of subsidized loans from international and national financial institutions, the Group is leading an innovation process intended to accelerate the mobilization of capital to support sustainable growth, through the use of sustainability-linked financial instruments.\n\nMore specifically, in 2022 the Group signed subsidized loans for a total of 1.8 billion euros, which, as in the case of private financing, provide for the inclusion of sustainability-linked mechanisms linked to SDG 13. Among the main operations, a special mention must be made of the sustainability-linked borrowings for a total of 800 million dollars by EFA, a Group company, and EKF (Danish export-credit agency), the first sustainability-linked borrowings agreement for the latter.\n\nIn the coming years, Enel will continue to make use of sustainable finance tools, with the aim of achieving a sustainable debt share of the Group\u2019s total debt of approximately 70% by 2025.\n\n**Participation in international round tables to promote sustainable finance**\n\nThe focus on sustainable finance is being confirmed, strengthening Enel\u2019s commitment to key global stakeholders, through the co-chairmanship of the United Nations Global Compact\u2019s CFO Coalition for the SDGs and involvement in the UN Global Investors for Sustainable Development (GISD) Alliance.\n\nAfter the launch of \u201cPrinciples on Integrated SDG Investments and Finance\u201d, the CFO Coalition focused its work on analyzing the targets defined by companies for the SDGs and the relative KPIs, business cases for the adoption of an SDG finance & investment strategy, and development of profiles by macro sector. In this context, the CFOs therefore invested more than 110 billion dollars in support of the SDGs achieving an increase of 55% in SDG finance as compared to the previous year. Furthermore, an Advisory Board was established, which includes Enel, which will provide sector-specific and geographical skills, help coordinate exchanges between CFOs and the largest community of sustainable finance on specific issues, and will provide information and contacts for the recruitment of new Coalition members.\n\nEqually important are the results obtained from the collaboration with the GISD Alliance, such as the update of the Model Mandate, which is a guide for asset owners to guarantee that the management and sustainability goals are fully reflected in the agreements and contracts with...\nthe managers of these assets. Furthermore, as Enel is a member of the GISD Alliance, contribution was given to the joint statement of the Alliance as a response to the public consultation launched by the International Sustainability Standard Board (ISSB) in terms of sustainability reporting. Also the work performed on a European level through our stakeholder of reference, CSR Europe, was considerable. In fact, on occasion of the European SDG Summit 2022, Enel participated in the roundtables: \u201cThe Role of Double Materiality in Sustainability Reporting\u201d regarding how double materiality is integrated in the CSRD and how companies can approach it, and \u201cThe Challenge of Circularity in the Green Transition\u201d regarding the circular economy and the energy transition. Also worth mentioning is Enel\u2019s involvement in the series of interviews on sustainable finance organized by the UN Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative.\n\nOur position on and commitment to the European Taxonomy\n\nEnel welcomes the development of the European Union (EU) Taxonomy Regulation, as it provides a standardized, science-based classification system to identify environmentally sustainable economic activities. The EU Taxonomy Regulation acts as an important enabler to promote sustainable investments and accelerate the decarbonization of the European economy, while at the same time creating reliability and transparency for investors and supporting companies in planning the Net-Zero transition.\n\nWe are fully committed to reporting on the implementation of the European Taxonomy Regulation pursuant to its Article 8 thereof and the Delegated Act which further specifies the content, methodology and presentation of information to be disclosed by companies of both a financial and non-financial nature.\n\nAs regards the Climate Delegated Act, which establishes criteria for verifying the contribution to climate mitigation and adaptation, we welcome the different thresholds defined in the Taxonomy based on climate and environmental sciences, such as the specific emission limit of 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh (taking into account the whole life cycle) to measure the substantial contribution to the climate change mitigation target set for most energy production technologies, as it is derived from a robust, science-based process.\n\nHowever, there are some activities that, although not covered under the EU Taxonomy Regulation, are critical to promoting the well-being of the public, especially in the short and medium term, while contributing to the sustainable development in the long term. As regards the energy industry, there are some important sustainability-related issues that the European Commission did not consider when developing the technical screening criteria, as they were outside the main scope of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. These issues include energy security, grid reliability or energy transition, which are crucial for Europe\u2019s well-being and are appropriately addressed by other policies, funds and regulations at EU and Member State level.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation is still in a developmental stage, and a number of important Delegated Acts are still being finalized at the time of publication of this Sustainability Report. These include acts that will detail the criteria for the remaining four objectives (sustainable use and protection of waters and marine resources; transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and of ecosystems) as well as those that will identify economic activities that do not have a significant harmful impact on environmental sustainability and those that do significantly damage it. Completion of the entire regulatory process should ensure that all globally recognized economic activities are considered, thereby reducing current uncertainties regarding implementation of the process itself.\n\nGoing beyond the disclosure requirements of the Taxonomy, Enel has included the Capex alignment percentage as one of the key performance indicators of the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework used to define the Company\u2019s sustainable financial instruments. With this important move forward, Enel reinforces the role of the Taxonomy as a driver to promote sustainable investment decisions and show how sustainability can be fully integrated into the financial landscape.\n\nEnel holds its annual Capital Markets Day to align its capital allocation with the EU Taxonomy set out in its Business Plan. In particular, in 2022 Enel announced a target in excess of 80% Capex alignment for the period 2023\u20132025 as part of its contribution to climate mitigation.\nOur implementation process and eligible activities\n\nIn 2020 we defined a structured process for implementing the European Taxonomy based on 5 phases:\n\n1. Identification of eligible economic activities\n2. Analysis of substantial contribution\n3. Assessment of the principle of Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) to other environmental objectives\n4. Verification of minimum social safeguards\n5. Calculation of financial metrics\n\nOver the past year, we have updated our eligibility analysis according to the process under the final version of the Climate Delegated Act published in the Official Journal of the European Union in December 2021 and under the Complementary Delegated Act published in the Official Journal of the European Union in July 2022.\n\nBelow are the activities of the business classified according to the European Taxonomy (Art. 8 EU Reg. 852/2020).\n\n| Aligned | Not-aligned | Not eligible |\n|---------|-------------|--------------|\n| \u2022 Solar and wind | \u2022 New connections between a substation or grid and a generation plant with greenhouse gas intensity over threshold of 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh | Trading |\n| \u2022 Hydro (99.6%) | \u2022 Distribution in Argentina and Colombia | Retail sale of power or gas to end users |\n| \u2022 Geothermal | \u2022 Gaseous fossil fuels (CCGT) | Financial services, general services and other unmeasured product clusters |\n| \u2022 RES Storage | | \u2022 Coal |\n| Distribution in Europe, Brazil, Chile and Peru without new connections between a substation or grid and a generation plant with greenhouse gas intensity over threshold of 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh | | \u2022 Nuclear(1) |\n| Smart Lighting, e-Bus, Energy Efficiency, Home, Vivi Meglio Unifamiliare, Condominium, Customer Insight, Distributed Energy, Battery Energy Storage | | \u2022 Fuel-oil and OCGT(2) |\n| e-Mobility | | |\n\n(1) The operation of our nuclear generation portfolio is not included among the eligible activities considered by the Complementary Delegated Act in the generation of electricity from nuclear power plants.\n\n(2) Includes both fuel-oil and gas (OCGT) as it is not possible to divide the two types of fuel. Fuel-oil was considered to be the prevalent fossil fuel and is therefore not eligible under the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\nThe high level of alignment of our economic activities with the EU Taxonomy Regulation in 2022, made possible by their substantial contribution to the climate change mitigation objective while respecting the principle of doing no significant harm (DNSH) to other environmental objective and observing the minimum social safeguards, is shown below:\n\n### % 2022 alignment of business activities to the European Taxonomy\n\n| % 2022 alignment | Description |\n|------------------|-------------|\n| **56.7%** of ordinary gross operating profit (EBITDA) | The EBITDA percentage of Taxonomy eligible and aligned businesses decreased in 2022 compared to 2021 (63.9%), primarily due to changes in revenue (see details below). |\n| **21.4%** of turnover | In 2022, there is a strong increase in absolute terms in turnover compared to 2021 (33.9%). This increase was most pronounced in non-aligned activities, such as power generation from gaseous fuels, and non-eligible activities, such as trading and marketing of electricity and gas and power generation from coal, mainly due to the market situation with high prices and higher thermal generation. The aligned turnover therefore decreases by 12%. |\n| **81.9%** of capital expenditure (Capex) | The actual 2022 Capex for eligible aligned activities is 4.5% higher than the Capex planned for 2022 in the Strategic Plan 2022-2024 for the same activities. This change is mainly due to higher investments in absolute terms in eligible and aligned activities than planned (over \u20ac0.5 billion) and also to adjustments made in the EU taxonomy accounting process, such as the integration of costs accounted for under IFRS 16 Leases, paragraph 53 (h), which had not been taken into consideration in the Strategic Plan 2022-2024. |\n| **66.9%** of operating expenditure (Opex) | The percentage of Opex of Taxonomy eligible and aligned activities increased in 2022 compared to 2021 (60.8% in 2021), mainly due to higher maintenance costs incurred in renewable energy production and Taxonomy-aligned distribution activities. |\n\nDetails of the steps related to the implementation process and results for each KPI (EBITDA, turnover, Capex and Opex) and specific tables on nuclear and fossil gas activities as required by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 of 9 March 2022 amending Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 concerning economic activities in certain energy sectors and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 concerning specific public disclosures for these economic activities are provided in the appendix to the Sustainability Report in the chapter \u201cOur position on and commitment to the European Taxonomy\u201d.\n\n(10) The 2021 figure has been restated based on methodological changes mentioned in the section \u201cProcess for calculating the financial metrics\u201d.\n\nOur commitment to continuous improvement\nSustainability ratings, indices and benchmarks\n\nESG analysts and rating agencies continuously monitor Enel\u2019s sustainability performance, by different methods, in relation to environmental, social and governance issues. ESG ratings are a strategic tool to support investors in assessing sustainable business models and identifying risks and opportunities linked to the sustainability in their investment portfolio, aiding the development of active and passive sustainable investment strategies.\n\nEnel is constantly committed to managing and reporting all ESG aspects, considering the assessments of the rating agencies as an important opportunity to improve its performance in terms of sustainability and devising specific action plans with the involvement of the various company units and Business Lines. The main actions implemented also thanks to these plans have concerned: increasing the transparency of performance related to ESG issues, reinforcing the process of due diligence of human rights, the complete mapping and assessment of the climatic associations with respect to the Paris objectives, defining and reporting the biodiversity \u201cNo Net Loss\u201d target, improving the reporting of Scope 3 emissions, in particular those related to the supply chain.\n\nIn 2022, Enel maintained its positioning in the main ESG indices and rankings, reaching leadership positions in most cases. Enel was also the first company to fully align its company reporting to the Net-Zero Company CA100+ Benchmark and was included in the Just Transition Assessment of the World Benchmarking Alliance.\n\nKey milestones 2022:\n\n- Inclusion in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for the third year running\n  - January 2022\n- Inclusion in the MSCI ESG Leaders for the third year running\n  - March 2022\n- Sector Leader in the Euronext Vigeo Eiris 120\n  - June 2022\n- Inclusion in the Climate \u201cA\u201d List for the fourth year running\n  - September 2022\n- Among the world\u2019s top utilities in the Equileap TOP 100 ranking\n  - December 2022\n- Industry Leader in the FTSE4Good Index\n  - March 2022\n- Among the world leaders in the DJSI World and DJSI Europe\n  - June 2022\n- Among the world leaders in the DJSI World and DJSI Europe\n  - December 2022\n\nMain ESG Indices & Rankings\n## Main ESG ratings\n\n| Rating          | Ranking       | Sector average | Scale (low | high) |\n|-----------------|---------------|----------------|-----------|--------|\n| **MSCI**        | AAA           | Top 10 / 144 utilities | BBB       | CCC | AAA |\n| **Sustainalytics** | **ESG Risk Rating** | 21 (Medium risk) / 30 / 296 electric utilities | 33.2 | 100 | 0 |\n| **S&P ESG Scores** | 90           | 2 / 250 electric utilities | 32 | 0 | 100 |\n| **CDP**         | A (climate) B (water) | - | B | B | D- | A |\n| **Refinitiv**   | 92            | 1 / 302 electric utilities | - | 0 | 100 |\n| **FTSE Russell** | 4.9           | 1 / 41 electric utilities | 2.8 | 0 | 5 |\n| **Vigeo Eiris** | 75            | 1 / 65 electric utilities | 52 | 0 | 100 |\n| **ISS ESG Score** | B            | - | C | D- | A+ |\n| **Reprisk Rating** | 42           | - | 48 | 100 | 0 |\nAdvisory panel\n\nThis year too, we have involved a group of external experts (advisory panel) to strengthen our sustainability reporting. The panel helps to assess and improve the quality and credibility of our Sustainability Report and to increase our level of ambition.\n\nIn particular, for the 2022 Sustainability Report, two sustainability experts were involved, with specific reference to issues related to corporate strategy and sustainable finance.\n\nAnjuli Pandit\n(Head of Sustainable Bonds \u2013 EMEA & Americas, HSBC)\n\nAnjuli Pandit is Head of Sustainable Bonds for EMEA and the Americas.

Panel members are unpaid.\nMateriality analysis\n\nWe analyze the context\nto identify and analyze the main current and future ESG megatrends, to limit risk and impact, and take full advantage of their opportunities.\n\nWe involve the different categories of internal and external stakeholders\nto always be open to listening to the individuals or interest groups that are influenced or could be influenced by the organization\u2019s activities.\n\nWe define the Priorities\u2019 Matrix\nby identifying and evaluating priority topics for the Company and its main stakeholders.\n\nWe assess the impacts generated and suffered (Double materiality)\nto identify the material topics, that is the topics that represent the organization\u2019s most significant impacts on the economy, environment and people, including impacts on human rights.\nMateriality analysis process and results for 2022\n\nThe sustainability context\n\nIn order to evaluate the economic, social and environmental challenges, identify the risks, limit their impacts and take full advantage of the relative opportunities as part of the broader materiality analysis process, an analysis of the main current and future ESG megatrends was carried out.\n\nWithin today\u2019s complex scenario, new generation and consumption models are emerging, dictated by ongoing technological and demographic changes, as well as by new economic and geopolitical balances.\n\nBased on the main publications within the scope of the Electric Utilities sector and the current public policies, the analysis of the sustainability context identified 14 main ESG megatrends, which include the digital revolution, definition of new governance models, climate and demographic change, preservation of resources. These phenomena influence both today and in the future the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development and often are mutually conditioned and act in combination, reinforcing their individual impact. The technological revolution and digitalization have in several cases accentuated income disparity and the consequent increase in inequalities. Climate change is contributing to displacement from rural to urban areas, and therefore to demographic changes in countries. Safeguarding resources entails the need to use and adopt technologies with a lower environmental impact.\n\nThe impacts of the 14 ESG megatrends identified in the social, economic and environmental context were analyzed and evaluated using a specific questionnaire completed by external, national and international stakeholders and experts. The results confirm climate change, the digital revolution and the preservation of resources as the main ESG megatrends, and highlight the increase in inequalities as a further area of focus in the current and future scenarios.\n\nFurthermore, due to the nature of its business and its geographical distribution, the Enel Group is exposed to various types of ESG risk, identified within the reference framework relating to the risk categories adopted by Enel, of which there are six: strategic, financial, operational, governance and culture, digital technology, and compliance. For further details and a description of the actions intended to mitigate their effects and ensure their correct management, refer to the chapter \u201cSound governance\u201d in this document.\nOur materiality analysis framework\n\nThrough the materiality analysis, which involves various categories of internal and external stakeholders, the material topics, namely the topics that represent the organization\u2019s most significant impacts on the economy, environment, people and human rights, are defined. The results of this analysis are used to help define the objectives to be included in the Strategic Plan and the Sustainability Plan, the achievement of which is contributed to by the various Group Functions and Business Lines, as well as the topics covered by the Sustainability Report and other Corporate Reporting documents.\n\nAs a result of the continuous monitoring of stakeholder expectations (\"dynamic materiality\"), the traditional way of looking at the priorities of ESG topics (\"Priorities\u2019 Materiality\") has been enriched by incorporating a view of the significance of the impacts generated and suffered (impact materiality and financial materiality) by the Company in the reference context (\"Double Materiality\").\n\nThe impact analysis model is of fundamental importance as it enables the Company to identify the material topics and focus on the best way to manage them, both in terms of risk management as well as in terms of strengthening opportunities. In addition, the Company must recognize its strategic priorities, taking into account also the view of its stakeholders. Identifying the priority ESG topics with which the Company wants to engage therefore strengthens the profile of impact management.\n\n(1) The concept of dynamic materiality \u2013 announced in 2020 by the World Economic Forum in the document \u201cEmbracing the new age of materiality\u201d \u2013 represents materiality as a dynamic process according to which what may be financially irrelevant today can become material tomorrow.\nMateriality analysis\n\n**Priorities\u2019 Materiality**\n\n- Identification of topics by analyzing:\n  - stakeholder and expert (internal and external) engagement initiatives\n  - sustainability rating agencies\n  - sector benchmarking studies\n  - strategic orientation of the Company\n  - Sustainability Reporting standards\n\n- The Group units responsible for stakeholder relations identify and update the list of the relevant stakeholder categories to ensure continuous alignment with the sustainability context in which Enel operates.\n\n- The process foresees the engagement of the stakeholders in the Company (Group Top Management) in order to determine the relevance of the categories based on the following parameters:\n  - Dependence\n  - Influence\n  - Tension\n\n- Assessments assigned to ESG topics considering the following parameters:\n  - Priority\n  - Satisfaction\n  - Impact\n\n- Assessment of the priorities of the topics in Company strategies by the various Company Functions and Top Management through ad hoc interviews and specific questionnaires.\n\n**Dynamic Materiality**\n\n- Understanding the context in which the Company operates\n\n- Analysis of the ESG megatrends based on the main public documents of the utilities sector and of public policies\n\n- Identification of topics (1st, 2nd, 3rd level)\n\n- Identification of the stakeholders (1st, 2nd, 3rd level)\n\n- Assignment of relevance to stakeholders\n\n- Assignment of priority to the topics by external stakeholders\n\n- Assignment of priority to the topics in Company strategies\n\n**Double Materiality**\n\n- Analysis of impacts on the main ESG megatrends\n\n- Assignment of priority to the topics by external stakeholders\n\n- Definition of the list of impacts\n\n- Analysis of impacts\n\n- Prioritization of the most significant impacts\n\n- Identification of the main impacts on ESG trends that are most relevant through a survey dedicated to external experts\n\n- Assessments assigned to ESG topics considering the following parameters:\n  - Priorities\n  - Satisfaction\n  - Impact\n\n- Definition and weighing of the list of impacts generated and suffered based on the collection of feedback from the internal stakeholders and experts, considering the point of view of the external stakeholders\n\n- Assessment of the significance of the impacts generated and suffered by the internal stakeholders, in close connection with the main external stakeholders\n\n- Identification of the most significant impacts generated and suffered for each ESG topic\n\n* The identified impacts are linked to the main ESG megatrends and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd level priority topics.\n\nActivity carried out in both processes\nFrom a \u201cdouble materiality\u201d perspective, according to which the Company can influence and be influenced by ESG topics, the topics are material to one or both of the following dimensions:\n\n- **impact materiality**: in line with the GRI 2021 standard, which identifies and analyzes material topics in terms of the impacts generated by the Company, namely the effects that the organization has or could have on the economy, the environment, people, and human rights, which in turn can indicate their contribution (negative or positive) to sustainable development;\n- **financial materiality**: in line with the main publications currently available (SASB, ISSB), which identifies and analyzes the material topics from a financial point of view, namely those that affect or could affect the Company\u2019s financial condition or operating results, and are therefore most relevant to investors.\n\n### Reference standards and governance of the materiality analysis process\n\nThe materiality analysis was developed in line with the GRI 2021 and the AccountAbility AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard (AA1000SES), taking into account the draft of the ESRS 1 standard \u2013 General Requirements prepared by EFRAG (European Financial Reporting Advisory Group), the Value Reporting Foundation \u2013 SASB standard and the SDG Compass, which supports companies in adapting their strategies to comply with the UN SDGs.\n\nThe Holding\u2019s Sustainability Planning, Performance Management and Human Rights unit, as part of the Innovability Function, is responsible for analyzing materiality at Group level and plays a guidance and coordination role, providing guidelines and methodological support for the country, Company and site level analysis conducted by local managers, with the involvement of stakeholders and the key figures at Company level.\n\nThe materiality analysis and the relative results, such as the material topics identified, are subject to specific examination by the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, set up within the Board of Directors, when examining the Sustainability Plan guidelines. Furthermore, the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee and the Control and Risks Committee issue prior opinions on the Sustainability Report, which includes the materiality analysis, and submit them to the Board of Directors\u2019 meeting called to approve the Report.\n\nThe collection, aggregation and processing of data relating to the engagement and analysis initiatives of the stakeholders and experts involved are managed through a dedicated computer system (\u201ce-mia\u00ae: Engagement \u2013 materiality & impact analysis\u201d), which also allows the best stakeholder engagement and monitoring practices to be shared within the Group in line with the Company\u2019s organizational model. The results, which are updated annually, are presented to the Group, the individual companies, the Business Lines/Corporate Functions and sites (potential or actual operating sites), as well as to the different categories of stakeholders. Every two years, an analysis is carried out with a view to possibly reviewing the topics and categories of stakeholders so as to take into account any significant changes in the internal and external context of the Company. In 2022, the scope of the materiality analysis included 21 countries, covering all continents where the Group is present. In particular, in 2022, new sites were added in Chile, Greece and Peru, with increasing integration of the results due to the application of the Creating Shared Value (CSV) tools to the Group\u2019s assets.\nPriorities\u2019 materiality\n\nIdentification of the topics\n\nThe topics subject to the 2022 analysis cover the entire sustainable business model and are classified into three categories: business and governance topics, social topics and environmental topics, divided into three levels to cover all the different cases.\n\nIn defining the ESG topics, multiple sources were considered and various stakeholder categories were directly and indirectly involved. The instruments used include:\n\n- the main ESG megatrends revealed in the sustainability context analysis (please refer to the section on \u201cThe sustainability context\u201d). A specific questionnaire, addressed to external stakeholders and experts, was used to identify the main ESG megatrends. The latter were correlated with the materiality analysis topics, thus serving as a guide in defining the relative impacts;\n- the topics of greatest interest to sustainability rating agencies;\n- sector benchmarking studies;\n- Sustainability Reporting standards;\n- the strategic guidance of the Company as well as input from experts inside and outside the organization.\n\nWe define and update the list of ESG topics every two years, with the support of the various units involved each year in the analysis process.\n\nIdentification of the stakeholders\n\nThe stakeholders involved in the 2022 materiality analysis represent the individuals or interest groups that are affected or could be affected by the organization\u2019s activities, with a view to successfully implementing its strategies and achieving its goals. We regularly involve our stakeholders through numerous listening initiatives in order to capture their expectations and identify potential and future impacts (please refer to the section on the \u201cPriorities\u2019 Matrix\u201d).\n\nThe stakeholders are grouped into categories, classified on three levels, in line with the structure of the topics analyzed.\n\nThe first level stakeholder categories are the following:\n\n- Businesses and trade associations\n- Customers\n- Financial community\n- Institutions\n- Civil society and local and global communities\n- Media\n- Enel people\n- Suppliers and contractors\n\nPlease refer to the table in section \u201cAssignment of priority to the topics by external stakeholders\u201d, which shows the stakeholder categories with their respective degree of relevance.\n\nWith the support of the various units responsible for stakeholder relations, which are involved in the analysis process every year, we identify and update the list of relevant stakeholder categories every two years, in order to define a complete list of actual and potential stakeholders and to ensure continuous alignment with the sustainability context in which Enel operates.\nAssignment of relevance to stakeholders\n\nThe process of assigning stakeholder relevance is conducted in accordance with the applicable standards and entails the involvement of the business units responsible for stakeholder relations and an assessment of each stakeholder according to their respective relevance.\n\nIn 2022, a specific questionnaire was put to the Top Management at the Business Line and country level, who were asked to assess the relevance of the categories based on the following parameters:\n\n- **Dependence**: Importance of the relationship for the stakeholder, indicating groups or individuals who directly or indirectly depend on the activities, products or services and associated services, or on which the organization depends in order to operate.\n- **Influence**: Importance of the relationship for the Company, indicating groups or individuals that may have an impact on the organization or on a stakeholder for strategic or operational decision-making.\n- **Tension**: Temporal dimension of the relationship, indicating groups or individuals who require the immediate attention of the organization on broader financial, economic, social or environmental topics.\n\n(See table in the section \u201cAssignment of priority to the topics by external stakeholders\u201d, which shows the stakeholder categories with their respective degree of relevance).\n\nIn particular, the analysis carried out at Group level shows that the relevance of \u201cSuppliers and Contractors\u201d stakeholder has grown over the last year, particularly given the awareness of their key role in managing the energy transition process. On the other hand, the relevance of the stakeholder \u201cEnel people\u201d, as a strategic player in the pursuit of sustainable business and continuous improvement of the Company, remains constant.\n\nAssignment of priority to the topics by external stakeholders\n\nHaving identified the topics and stakeholder categories and weighted them according to their respective relevance, the materiality analysis process then proceeds with an assessment of the priorities assigned to the topics by the external stakeholders, taking into account the related impacts generated on the economy, the environment, people, and human rights (horizontal axis of the priorities and expectations matrix) (please refer to the \u201c2022 Priorities\u2019 Matrix\u201d). An analysis of the priorities assigned by the Group\u2019s relevant stakeholders results in the definition of the priority topics for stakeholders, based on which the potential and actual impacts of the Company are defined.\n\nIn 2022, the priorities assigned to the topics were identified thanks to the implementation of approximately 460 engagement initiatives (surveys, focus groups, interviews, document analysis, etc.) with relevant stakeholders for the Group. Less than 1% of the assessments were carried out indirectly, through interviews with the business units responsible for the relationship with the reference stakeholder (\u201cself-assessment\u201d), demonstrating the objectivity of the analyses carried out. The engagement initiatives used in the materiality analysis are part of the various engagement initiatives carried out during the year by the Group\u2019s various units. These initiatives include: customer satisfaction surveys; the \u201cWellbeing Global Survey\u201d, aimed at collecting expectations and the degree of satisfaction regarding the numerous initiatives promoted by the Company concerning the physical and psychological well-being of Enel people; questionnaires from sustainability rating agencies; customer complaints; relations with analysts and investors, representative and trade associations; institutional relations at national and local levels, as well as with trade unions; media monitoring and opinion polls. In some cases, where necessary, ad hoc materiality analysis initiatives were implemented, including an online questionnaire for suppliers or focus groups aimed at specific categories of stakeholders.\n\nThe following table shows, for each internal and external stakeholder category identified at 1st Level and involved in the materiality analysis process, the respective degree of relevance, the engagement initiatives used, the priority topics and the Company\u2019s response methods.\n### Relevance\n\n| List of 1st level stakeholders | Type of engagement | no. | Engagement initiative | no. | Main high/very high priority topics for stakeholders | Our response to stakeholders in the CHAPTERS/paragraphs of the Report |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------|-----|-----------------------|-----|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Businesses and trade associations** | Qualitative assessment | 45 | Focus group | 8 | \u2022 Infrastructure and networks | CLEAN ELECTRIFICATION -

The 2022 results of the expectations analysis show a substantial alignment between the priorities assigned by stakeholders and their level of satisfaction. It should be noted that the topic related to the \u201cSustainable supply chain\u201d experienced an increase in satisfaction in terms of positioning compared to 2021, denoting appreciation for Enel\u2019s strong commitment to managing the environmental and social impacts associated with the supply chain.\n\n| List of 1st level stakeholders | Type of engagement | Engagement initiative | Main high/very high priority topics for stakeholders | Our response to stakeholders in the CHAPTERS/paragraphs of the Report |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Media                          | Qualitative assessment | Focus group | \u2022 Infrastructure and networks | CLEAN ELECTRIFICATION - electrification of uses, digitalization of the grids |\n|                                |                     | Indirect survey | \u2022 Engaging local and global communities | ENGAGING COMMUNITIES |\n|                                |                     | Additional indexes | \u2022 Preservation of ecosystems and environmental management | CONSERVATION OF NATURAL CAPITAL |\n|                                |                     | Survey with focus on ESG topics | | |\n|                                |                     | Document analysis | | |\n|                                | Survey              | Surveys sent directly by the e-mia\u00ae system for assessment of ESG topics priority | | |\n| Enel people                    | Qualitative assessment | Focus group | \u2022 Sound governance and fair corporate conduct | SOUND GOVERNANCE |\n|                                |                     | One-on-one interview | \u2022 Decarbonization of the energy mix | ZERO EMISSIONS AMBITION |\n|                                |                     | Additional indexes | \u2022 People management, development and motivation | EMPOWERING ENEL PEOPLE |\n|                                |                     | Survey with focus on ESG topics | | |\n|                                |                     | Document analysis | | |\n|                                | Survey              | Surveys sent directly by the e-mia\u00ae system for assessment of ESG topics priority | | |\n| Suppliers and contractors      | Qualitative assessment | Focus group | \u2022 Sound governance and fair corporate conduct | SOUND GOVERNANCE |\n|                                |                     | One-on-one interview | \u2022 Occupational health and safety | OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY |\n|                                |                     | Open response questionnaire | \u2022 Sustainable supply chain | SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN |\n|                                |                     | Additional indexes | | |\n|                                |                     | Survey with focus on ESG topics | | |\n|                                |                     | Document analysis | | |\n|                                | Survey              | Surveys sent directly by the e-mia\u00ae system for assessment of ESG topics priority | | |\n\n(1) An engagement initiative could involve multiple stakeholder categories.\nAssessment of priority to the topics in Company strategies\n\nFor the purposes of drawing up the 2022 Priorities\u2019 Matrix, Enel assessed the priority of the topics in its strategies (vertical axis of the Priorities\u2019 Matrix), taking into account the guidelines set by the Strategic Plan, the objectives of the Functions/Business Lines and the commitments made by the Group through its own policies and conduct criteria. This analysis involved the Company\u2019s various Functions and Top Management (Chief Executive Officer and Chairman) through ad hoc interviews and specific questionnaires.\n\nPriorities\u2019 Matrix\n\nThe aspects covered in the previous paragraphs, namely the priority of topics for stakeholders and in corporate strategies, contribute to the development of the Priorities\u2019 Matrix.\n\nThe process makes it possible to identify the priorities for stakeholders and the Company at both Group and country level, down to each Business Line/Corporate Function and individual asset (understood as a potential or effective operating site).\n\nIn 2022, the analysis covered 21 countries, 64 companies and 36 sites and considered 463 engagement initiatives involving stakeholders relevant to the Group.\n\nShown below are:\n\n- the 2022 Priorities\u2019 Matrix of the Enel Group, which considers the contributions of the main companies involved in the process, weighted according to their relevance in relation to the type of business in which they operate;\n- the main 2022 priorities \u2013 in consolidated view \u2013 of some of the main companies participating in the materiality analysis process.\n\nThe following are some of the main priority topics and how they should be handled.\n\n- **Occupational health and safety** \u2013 Enel considers the health, safety, mental and physical integrity of people to be among the Group\u2019s main priorities. Optimal management of this topic helps to generate trust and boost the commitment of people in relation to the work they perform, also helping to improve performance and raise productivity and efficiency. As a confirmation of Enel\u2019s constant commitment to safety in 2022, the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) for Enel and contractor companies combined was down by 22% compared to 2021.\n\n- **Decarbonization of the energy mix** \u2013 The fight against climate change has become one of the key challenges facing companies. In the utilities sector in particular, this has led to the development of regulations and public policies aimed at promoting a global zero emissions economy, in which electrification of the energy demand plays a key role. Institutional investors are devoting ever-greater attention to the management and results of companies in relation to climate change. In this context, Enel has set specific objectives for the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, focusing on the growth of renewable capacity and the gradual closure of coal plants (please refer to the \u201cSustainability Plan 2023-2025\u201d and the \u201cZero emissions ambition\u201d sections of this document).\n\n- **People management, development and motivation** \u2013 In line with our Open Power approach, we work every day to create an open, inclusive and dynamic working environment that seeks to incorporate diversity, attract new talent and empower our people. In particular, Enel\u2019s commitment to closing the gender gap and ensuring equal pay continues with tangible results, the result of actions that affect all stages of women\u2019s career paths in the organization. The Long-Term-Incentive Plan 2022 actually supports these trends, confirming the target \u201cpercentage of women in Top Management succession plans\u201d of 45% by the end of 2025, with a view to continuing a policy of preparing a suitable pool for managerial appointments in the near future.\n\nThe priority topics for stakeholders and the Company thus defined are subject to analysis according to the double materiality approach, which aims to identify the material topics (please refer to the section \u201cMaterial topics\u201d).\nThe main 2022 priorities for the Countries\n\n(1) The 2022 materiality analysis concerned 21 countries. The chart shows the results of only some of the main companies that participated in the process. As concerns Enel Am\u00e9ricas, in 2022 Uruguay did not participate in the materiality analysis process.\nDouble materiality\n\nDefinition, analysis and prioritization of the most significant impacts.\n\nThe materiality analysis process has evolved and the traditional view is now complemented with that of double materiality, in which financial materiality and impact materiality each represent an equally important perspective. Through the involvement of the Group\u2019s key stakeholders and internal and external experts, the process seeks to analyze the most significant impacts in order to identify material topics, taking into account \u2013 especially for negative impacts \u2013 the due diligence process and the relative results.\n\nEnel has therefore identified the impacts based on the following activities:\n\n- **analysis of the main ESG megatrends**: a survey of external (national and international) stakeholders and experts, with the aim of assessing the impacts of the main ESG megatrends through an analysis of the context in which we operate. (please refer to the section \u201cThe sustainability context\u201d);\n\n- **assignment of priority to the topics by external stakeholders**: more than 460 engagement initiatives involving the Group\u2019s main external stakeholders (for example, through surveys, focus groups, desk analysis, etc.), in order to assess the priority, satisfaction and impact of ESG topics (please refer to the section \u201cAssessing priorities and satisfaction of topics assigned by stakeholders\u201d);\n\n- **definition of the impacts list**: direct involvement of internal stakeholders and experts in defining and weighting the list of impacts generated and suffered on the basis of their feedback, also taking into account the views of external stakeholders. The impacts list has therefore been subject to thorough analysis and review by experts who internally oversee business activities, giving rise to positive and negative impacts that affect or may affect the relationship with the Group\u2019s relevant stakeholders.\n\nOnce the impacts have been identified, Enel proceeds with their analysis, that is with the assessment of the respective significance, both on a material level of the impact as well as financial materiality level, through the involvement of the Group\u2019s internal stakeholders and experts who, in performing their business activities, have a greater relationship with the main stakeholders and so have a complete view of the actual and/or potential impacts in the external context in which Enel operates.\n\nAs regards the impact materiality, in 2022, Enel strengthened the methodology for analyzing the impacts generated by the Company to bring it into line with the provisions of GRI 2021. Following the pilot project launched in 2019 and its completion in 2020 and 2021, with the involvement of all the countries participating in the process, in 2022 the Group conducted an impact materiality analysis which, through the involvement of the relevant stakeholders and experts and based on the best practices dictated by the due diligence process, identified the impacts generated by the Company on the economy, the environment and people, considering any violations of human rights as among the negative impacts and the contribution to sustainable development among the positive impacts. The impact analysis was carried out by each local Sustainability and Holding unit in order to assess the significance of the impacts, a process involving the Group\u2019s internal experts and stakeholders who, in performing their business activities, have a close relationship with the main stakeholders and so have a complete view of the actual and/or potential impacts in the external context in which Enel operates. This analysis took into account the internal company context, including upstream and downstream activities in its value chain, the main stakeholders, and the best practices dictated by the due diligence process, and assessed the (actual and potential) positive and negative impacts generated by the Company. Negative impacts were analyzed...\naccording to their significance based on the degree of severity and likelihood, in the case of potential impacts. Positive impacts were analyzed according to their significance and based on their scope and direct and indirect contribution to the SDGs, in line with the commitment made by the Group, and with respect to the management instruments put in place to monitor the objectives set. On the basis of the impact materiality assessment, for reporting purposes the most significant positive and negative impacts generated (actual and/or potential) were selected according to their highest degree of significance for each material topic (1st Level). The table below shows:\n\n- the most significant impacts \u2013 associated with ESG megatrends, the material topic (1st, 2nd, 3rd Level) and related GRI \u2013 both positive and negative generated directly and indirectly by the Company vis-\u00e0-vis the external context;\n- type: whether actual or potential;\n- the time horizon for their occurrence (short-, medium- or long-term);\n- impact management: the Company strategies and performance, in line with the management of the main types of risk faced by the Enel Group;\n- additional information: whether the reported impact is or could be a human rights concern; the reference SDGs; the phase of the value chain affected by the impact; the stakeholders that can or could be positively or negatively affected by the impact; whether the topic related to the reported impact is a priority for the stakeholders involved in the materiality analysis process; reference to the Sustainability Plan and to the chapter of the Report that describes in detail the management methods and results related to the impact.\n\n---\n\n(2) The severity of an actual or potential negative impact is determined by the following parameters:\n- scale: how severe the impact is;\n- scope: how widespread the impact is;\n- irremediable character: how difficult it is to counteract or repair the resulting damage.\n\n(3) The significance of a positive impact is determined by the scale and scope of the impact, as well as by the probability of the impact in the event it is potentially positive.\n| ESG megatrend | Material topic (I level) | Material topic (II, III level) | Description of the impact | Relevant GRI(1) | Type(2) \u2013 Duration(3) |\n|---------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|----------------------|\n| Climate change, Resources preservation | Decarbonization of the energy mix | Climate change \u2013 Reduction in CO\u2082 emissions | Contribution to the achievement of international and national goals to achieve a zero-emission global economy and society and to limit the increase in the global average temperature (1.5 \u00b0C \u2013 2 \u00b0C) | GRI 305: Emissions | Actual |\n| Resources preservation | Decarbonization of the energy mix | Energy use \u2013 Reducing energy consumption | Major and widespread commitment to efficient and sustainable use of energy in all business processes through initiatives to improve and accelerate the transition to more efficient technologies aimed at reducing energy consumption and promoting renewable sources | GRI 302: Energy | Actual |\n| Urbanization, Digital revolution | Infrastructure and networks | Network improvement and development \u2013 Development of micro-grids and rural electrification | Guarantee grid extension and micro-grid solutions in rural and suburban areas through the creation of new grid connections | DMA (former EU23): Access to energy | Actual |\n| Resources preservation | Preservation of ecosystems and environmental management | Protecting biodiversity and natural capital \u2013 Conservation and promotion of local natural heritage | Strong and widespread commitment to biodiversity through initiatives aimed at protecting and restoring habitats and natural capital, in particular in protected areas and in respect of threatened species and the adoption of location and design criteria that can guarantee no-net-deforestation, No Go in natural UNESCO World Heritage sites and no net loss of biodiversity | GRI 304: Biodiversity | Actual |\n| Well-being | Occupational health and safety | Safety of contractors working at Enel sites \u2013 Promotion of a safety culture among contractors working at Enel sites | Decrease in the number of injuries and illnesses among contractors, thanks to improved safety culture | GRI 403: Occupational health and safety | Actual |\n| Inclusion and gender equality, Future work | People management, development and motivation | Quality of corporate life \u2013 Work-life balance | Increasing workers\u2019 quality of life and well-being by improving work-life balance and psychological/physical well-being | GRI 401: Employment | Actual |\n| Inclusion and gender equality, Future work | People management, development and motivation | Valuing workers\u2019 diversity \u2013 Valuing disabilities, Valuing age diversity, Valuing gender diversity, Valuing other diversities | Valuing diversity (e.g. inclusion of people with disabilities, diversity in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, etc.) to develop and attract new talent and ensure their recruitment | GRI 405: Diversity and equal opportunity | Actual |\n\n(1) \u201c-\u201d is reported where the material topic is not currently covered by a specific GRI\n(2) Type: actual/potential\n(3) Duration: Short term (up to 1 year) Medium term (2 to 5 years) Long term (>5 years)\nEnel has brought forward its commitment by 10 years, from 2050 to 2040, to complete the decarbonization process of its entire value chain, by reducing its own direct and indirect emissions to zero (so-called \u2018Net-Zero\u2019).\n\nTo this end, Enel has constructed a roadmap that includes medium-term objectives to 2030 against 2037 as a benchmark, as certified by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in line with the 1.5 \u00b0C pathway. In particular, the Company has committed to: (i) direct greenhouse gas emissions per kWh by 80%; (ii) emissions related to electricity sales per kWh by 78%; (iii) total emissions related to the retail sale of gas by 55%; (iv) other total direct and indirect emissions by 55%. The Group\u2019s strategic actions make it possible to mitigate the potential risks and exploit the opportunities associated with transition variables. In this context, capital employment is centered on decarbonization through the development of assets for generation from renewable sources (aimed at achieving 100% renewable installed capacity by 2040), on enabling infrastructure linked to the development of networks, and on the implementation of platform models, fully exploiting technological and digital evolution which will favor consumption electrification and the development of new services for end customers.\n\nCommitment to an efficient and sustainable use of energy is guaranteed through the adoption of energy efficiency measures and improvement of energy consumption in all industrial processes. In pursuit of this objective, the transition to more efficient and renewable technologies plays a decisive role in promoting a process of electrification of energy consumption.\n\nEnel is constantly at work to develop and improve the efficiency of the transport and distribution network, in coordination with the other entities operating on the network infrastructure in various capacities. Enel carries out actions of network development, modernization, and maintenance on the infrastructure existing in all Countries, to improve the quality of the service delivered and reduce the number and duration of outages (SAIDI and SAIFI). Reaching and connecting vast rural and remote areas of the world means integrating technological innovation with socio-economic development. In fact, Enel Grids has carried out numerous electrification projects, in which grid extension solutions are adopted, depending on the specific context. In particular, Enel aims to guarantee energy in rural and suburban areas by increasing the number of new connections and at the same time making the grid increasingly innovative, digital and resilient, including through the spread of the latest smart meters.\n\nIn environmental and natural ecosystems, Enel is implementing suitable actions in order to protect, restore and conserve biodiversity, in species and natural habitats, respecting the principle of mitigation hierarchy. Enel is committed to restore and compensate, as well as suitable terrestrial, marine and monitoring activities to check the effectiveness of the adopted measures. In this context, the Group acknowledges that protecting the environment and natural resources, combating climate change and contributing to sustainable economic development are strategic factors in the planning, operation and development of the Group. This commitment is reflected in a dedicated principle in the Policy on Human Rights, in line with the environmental policy which also includes respect for biodiversity. Enel is an active part of the international debate with stakeholders and the networks with the most influence on the topic (for example, Business for Nature, Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosure, World Business Council for Sustainable Development and Science Based Targets for Nature) regarding natural and biodiversity topics. Enel implements prevention, mitigation and recovery programs and plans regarding the impacts on ecosystems and natural habitats in all critical and/or significant sites for all our assets.\n\nEnel considers the health, safety and psychological and physical well-being of individuals the most precious asset to be protected at all times of life. It is therefore committed to developing and promoting a robust safety culture for the people who work with and for the Group. Enel\u2019s commitment is demonstrated in the Group\u2019s Policy on Human Rights, the \u201cDeclaration of Commitment to Health and Safety\u201d and the \u201cStop Work Policy\u201d. In particular, Enel\u2019s commitment is reflected in a dedicated principle in the Policy on Human Rights, in line with the environmental policy which also includes respect for biodiversity. Enel is an active part of the international debate with stakeholders and the networks with the most influence on the topic (for example, Business for Nature, Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosure, World Business Council for Sustainable Development and Science Based Targets for Nature) regarding natural and biodiversity topics. Enel implements prevention, mitigation and recovery programs and plans regarding the impacts on ecosystems and natural habitats in all critical and/or significant sites for all our assets.\n\nEnel is committed to developing and disseminating a robust culture of health, safety and well-being throughout the entire corporate perimeter, in order to guarantee a workplace that is free of risks to health and safety, and to promote behaviors oriented towards \u201cwork-life integration\u201d. It is therefore actively committed to promoting personal and organizational well-being as enabling factors for the engagement and innovative potential of the people who work with us, including suppliers and contractors. The following are implemented for suppliers: a continuous process of field inspections and consequence management; a Contractor Safety Partnership program, to share Enel\u2019s core values on safety; a Safety Support activity plan with improvement pathways and support for the training of contractor staff.\n\nEnel promotes the principles of diversity, inclusion, equal treatment and opportunity and is committed to guaranteeing the right to working conditions that respect the dignity of every person and to creating a working environment in which people are treated fairly and valued for their uniqueness. This commitment is reflected in the Policy on Human Rights, and in the adoption of a Diversity and Inclusion Policy, published in parallel with adoption of the seven Women Empowerment Principles (WEP) promoted by the UN Global Compact and UN Women, in compliance with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The most significant initiatives include actions dedicated to a systematic impact on the various aspects of the gender gap and inclusion, specific listening and support services made available to people during the pandemic, projects dedicated to people with vulnerabilities, awareness initiatives on LGBTQ+ topics and cultural diversity.\n\n| Impact management | Relevant SDG | Stakeholders involved | Stage in value chain | Ref. in Sustainability Plan and 2022 Sustainability Report chapter |\n|-------------------|-------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Enel has brought forward its commitment by 10 years, from 2050 to 2040, to complete the decarbonization process of its entire value chain, by reducing its own direct and indirect emissions to zero (so-called \u2018Net-Zero\u2019).

This commitment is reflected in the Policy on Human Rights and through the anti-corruption program known as the \u201cZero Tolerance of Corruption Plan\u201d, one of the pillars on which our Anti-Corruption Management System is structured. In this context, Enel has adopted as part of its corporate governance specific compliance programs, i.e. the Code of Ethics, the Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan (\u201cZTC Plan\u201d), the Policy on Human Rights, the Policy on international sanctions, the Enel Global Compliance Program (\u201cEGCP\u201d), the Model pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/01 and other national compliance programs adopted by Group companies in accordance with their national legislation. Furthermore, to further pursue its commitment to fighting corruption, Enel voluntarily decided to certify its Anti-Bribery Management System (ISGCP) in compliance with the requirements of international standard ISO 37001:2016 (international certification of anti-bribery management systems). External staff, working for Enel Group company suppliers, undertake to comply with the ethical clauses set out in their respective contracts, which incorporate references to Enel\u2019s commitment in terms of business integrity in the pursuit of its activities. The ongoing monitoring of legislative and regulatory developments at the local, national and international levels is guaranteed by the operations of specific company Functions with competence in relation to these matters. Continuous training takes place by means of various dissemination and communication initiatives, as well as awareness campaigns regarding the principles of integrity and ethics in business conduct. | 16 17 | Enel people Suppliers and contractors | Sound governance |\n| The Group\u2019s approach is aimed at creating shared value with the communities with which it operates and collaborates. This approach, integrated into the business, is based on listening to the local needs of stakeholders. The Group aims at the economic and social development of the context in which it operates through numerous projects aimed at sustainability, involving an increasing number of beneficiaries. | 3 4 | Businesses and trade associations Civil society and local and global communities Suppliers and contractors Enel people Institutions Customers | Engaging communities |\n| Enel contributes to the creation of a resilient and sustainable supply chain, by promoting co-innovation projects with a view to decarbonization and circular economy. As part of the tendering process, increasingly challenging emissions targets are set, which also take into account the possible contributions of innovation. To this end, Enel has adopted a process of defining mandatory requirements and rewarding factors (sustainability K) relating to ESG and circular economy. Data collected during the tendering stage \u2013 enables us to measure emissions for the entire supply chain, and is the first step in the decarbonization pathway. Enel works together with suppliers to define criteria, technical requirements and solutions aimed at further strengthening circularity and sustainability in the early stages of the value chain. | 13 | Suppliers and contractors | Sustainable supply chain Managing human rights |\n| Enel considers the electrification of transport as the key to decarbonizing consumption, using digitalization as an accelerator for the development of increasingly innovative, flexible and integrated services. In this context, electric mobility plays a fundamental, role demonstrated by the continuous spread of new services and products, such as charging points for electric vehicles, which are increasingly common throughout the country. | 2 12 | Businesses and trade associations Civil society and local and global communities Suppliers and contractors Enel people Institutions Customers | Clean electrification |\n| Enel promotes the dissemination of innovative and inclusive products and services, such as automatic payments, e-billing, the \u201cslow shopping\u201d method (aimed at creating meaningful experiences for customers with disabilities through specific dedicated channels, using accessible apps and digital services). Enel monitors the rate of customer satisfaction in every country in which it operates through specific surveys and analysis of customer feedback. | 7 11 | Businesses and trade associations Customers Civil society and local and global communities | Clean electrification |\n| In conjunction with the various Functions and Business Lines, the Holding Innovability Function\u00ae (Innovation and Sustainability), reporting directly to the CEO, manages innovation activities in conformity with regulations currently in force and with the Group\u2019s compliance programs. With the aim of supporting the Group\u2019s Strategic Plan and responding to the innovation needs of the business, an Innovation Plan is defined annually. Starting from the Innovation Plan, shared with the Top Management and submitted for the approval of the Holding Innovation Committee (chaired by the Director of Innovability\u00ae), innovative solutions are sought to be tested and scaled globally through innovation tools (e.g. intelligence, crowdsourcing) and collaboration with startups, SMEs, large companies and the academic world. | 9 13 17 | Businesses and trade associations Civil society and local and global communities Media Suppliers and contractors Enel people | Innovation |\n| Capital employment is centered on decarbonization through the development of assets for generation from renewable sources, on enabling infrastructure linked to the development of networks, and on the implementation of platform models, fully exploiting technological and digital evolution which will favor consumption electrification and the development of new services for end customers. | 8 | Businesses and trade associations Civil society and local and global communities Suppliers and contractors Enel people Financial community Institutions Customers | Zero emissions ambition Clean electrification |\n### Table of the most significant impacts\n\n| ESG megatrend | Material topic (I level) | Material topic (II, III level) | Description of the impact | Relevant GRI(2) | Type(3) \u2013 Duration(4) |\n|---------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|----------------------|\n| Climate change, Resources preservation | Decarbonization of the energy mix | Climate change \u2013 Reduction in CO\u2082 emissions | Failure to contribute to the fight against climate change due to the increase in CO\u2082 emissions deriving from the operation of thermoelectric plants | GRI 305: Emissions | Potential |\n| Urbanization, Digital revolution | Infrastructure and networks | Operational grid management \u2013 Grid maintenance | Reduction of electricity transmission caused by overload issues in the national grid | DMA (former EU23): Access to energy System efficiency (EU12) | Potential |\n| Resources preservation | Conservation of ecosystems and environmental management | Water management - Wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse | Negative environmental damage (e.g. depletion of natural water resources with consequent decay of related ecosystem services, pollution and/or deterioration of water and soil) due to inadequate water management (e.g. excessive water withdrawals in relation to the resource regeneration capacity and ecosystem needs, particularly in water-stressed areas, uncontrolled discharges or leaks of wastewater, effluents with an excessive heat load or pollutants) | GRI 303: Water and effluents GRI 306: Effluents and waste | Potential |\n| Well-being | Occupational health and safety | Health and safety of workers of contractors operating on Enel sites Worker safety \u2013 Promotion of safety culture among workers, Management and monitoring of worker safety | Increase in the number of workplace injuries suffered by workers and contractors, due to lack of safety management and monitoring | GRI 403: Occupational health and safety GRI 410: Safety practices | Potential |\n| Inclusion and gender equality, Future work | People management, development and motivation | People development \u2013 Recruitment and remuneration policies | Decrease in the ability to attract talent and increased worker turnover due to inadequate hiring and compensation policies and benefit programs | GRI 401: Employment | Potential |\n\n---\n\n(1) \u201c-\u201d is reported where the material topic is not currently covered by a specific GRI\n(2) Type: actual/potential\n(3) Duration: Short term (up to 1 year) Medium term (2 to 5 years) Long term (>5 years)\nThe roadmap of the decarbonization process envisages the gradual phase-out of coal-fired capacity by 2027, in addition to the progressive expansion of generation from renewable sources.\n\nEnel, as DSO (Distribution System Operator), follows the network code of the TSO (Transmission System Operator that governs the countries in which it operates). Enel constantly invests in network development, renewal and maintenance on the infrastructure existing in all Countries, with the primary aim of improving the quality of the service delivered and reducing the number and duration of outages.\n\nThe adoption of ISO 14001-certified Environmental Management Systems certified within the Group ensures the presence of structured policies and procedures to identify and manage the environmental risks and opportunities associated with all corporate activities. Enel is constantly monitoring all power generation sites located in zones at risk of water scarcity (water stressed areas) in order to ensure efficient use of water resources. Mapping of production sites falling within water stressed areas is done in line with the criteria of GRI 303 (2018) with reference to the conditions of \u201cbaseline Water Stress\u201d. With the aim of identifying technological solutions to reduce consumption, particular attention is paid to assets present in areas with a high level of water stress. The risk of water scarcity is also mitigated by the growth of generation from renewable sources, which do not essentially depend on the availability of water for their operation. In this context, the Group acknowledges that protecting the environment and natural resources, combating climate change and contributing to sustainable economic development are strategic factors in the planning, operation and development of our activities. This commitment is reflected in a dedicated principle in the Policy on Human Rights, including in line with the environmental policy which also includes respect for biodiversity.\n\nEnel is committed to developing and disseminating a robust culture of health, safety and well-being throughout the entire corporate perimeter, in order to guarantee a workplace that is free of risks to health and safety, and to promote behaviors oriented towards \u201cwork-life integration\u201d. It is therefore actively committed to promoting personal and organizational well-being as enabling factors for the engagement and innovative potential of the people who work with us, including suppliers and contractors. Each person must feel that they are responsible for their own health and safety as well as for the health and safety of others. This is also expressed in integrating health and safety into training processes and activities. Enel\u2019s commitment is demonstrated in the Group\u2019s Policy on Human Rights. The Group has developed a Health and Safety Management System in compliance with international standard BS OHSAS 45001, based on identifying hazards, qualitative and quantitative risk assessment, and on planning and implementing preventive and protective measures. This system also considers the rigorous selection and management of contractors and suppliers, promoting their involvement in continuous safety performance improvement programs. In particular, these processes make it possible to direct, integrate and monitor, both at Group and Country level, all the prevention, protection and intervention actions aimed at protecting the health of workers and contractors, also in relation to exogenous health risk factors that may not be strictly related to work activities.\n\nIn line with our Open Power approach, we work every day to create an open, inclusive and dynamic working environment that seeks to incorporate diversity, attract new talent and empower our people. The new digital tools to support the selection process favor full participation and inclusion of all the candidates involved, using gamification experiences at a global level and a video interview supported by artificial intelligence, aimed at an in-depth exploration of the aptitudes of the young talent involved.\n\nOver the last year, several initiatives, most of which have been digital, have been developed in relation to talent attraction and employer branding, aimed at building a corporate identity that is attractive to potential candidates. New regulations have also been released at a global level, which also include the e-profile tool as an opportunity to enhance people\u2019s hard and soft skills, their aspirations and their motivations for change.\n| ESG megatrend | Material topic (I level) | Material topic (II, III level) | Description of the impact | Relevant GRI(2) | Type(3) \u2013 Duration(4) |\n|---------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|----------------------|\n| New governance models | Sound governance and fair corporate conduct | Structure of the Board of Directors and Top Management \u2013 Balanced structure and diversity of the Board of Directors | Worsening of external stakeholders\u2019 perception of the Group\u2019s inclusion practices due to the lack of diversity in the governing bodies of subsidiaries | GRI 406: Non-discrimination | Potential |\n| Increase in inequalities | Engaging local and global communities | Consultation with the local community in the development of new projects \u2013 Dialog, sharing and engagement on shared goals | Possible conflicts or opposition from local communities due to the lack of sharing of the environmental and socio-economic benefits of the project | GRI 413: Local communities | Potential |\n| Increase in inequalities | Sustainable supply chain | Respect for human rights in the supply chain \u2013 Integration of human rights and labor rights criteria and performance into fuel supply management | Procurement of goods and services produced by activities related to potential human rights violations (e.g. exploitation of unskilled and low-paid workers) | GRI 414: Supplier Social Assessment | Potential |\n| New economy, Digital revolution, New mobility, Urbanization | Products and services for electrification and digitalization | New technologies and solutions for Homes, Condominiums, Cities, Industry and financial activities | Reduction of positive environmental impacts due to possible delays in the installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies (energy-efficient products and services) | -

The qualification system requires suppliers to commit to adopting best practices in terms of human rights and working conditions, impact on communities, dissemination of principles regarding respect for human rights, throughout their value chain. The General Terms and Conditions of Contract also require compliance with relevant current legislation and regulations, and for suppliers to sign up to the principles to which Enel has committed in the Policy on Human Rights, Code of Ethics, Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan, and global compliance programs. | 19 | Civil society and local and global communities Suppliers and contractors Businesses and trade associations | Sustainable supply chain Human rights management |\n| The Enel X Global Retail Business Line was set up in order to respond to the new scenarios opened up by the electrification process and to design offers that are increasingly adapted to customer needs, and is therefore aimed at providing a fast and timely service to customers. Enel mitigates the risk related to the lack and/or delays in the supply of raw materials through the diversification of its suppliers. Any delays in the supply chain due to the scarcity of raw materials are appropriately mitigated by Enel through the diversification of suppliers. | 7 8 11 | Civil society and local and global communities Customers Enel people Suppliers and contractors | Clean electrification |\n| The Group has committed to a \u201cjust energy transition for all\u201d, including by offering innovative and inclusive services for customers of all ages, weak, destitute or marginalized customers, vulnerable families in line with the provisions of the Policy on Human Rights. In all the countries in which the Group operates, we also provide forms of support that make it easier for certain sections of the population to pay electricity and gas bills, thus allowing equal access to energy. One example is the action taken in Italy and Spain through the so-called \u201csocial bonus\u201d, but also in Romania, Brazil, Peru and Colombia where initiatives have been promoted dedicated to providing adequate support to vulnerable sections of society and who in particular are affected by the increase in energy costs. | 11 17 | Businesses and trade associations Civil society and local and global communities Customers | Clean electrification |\n| We apply the circular economy throughout the goods\u2019 lifecycle: from the design stages of the supply chain to their use and ultimately reuse in a new cycle at the end of their service life. Enel pursues the objective of separating its business from the consumption of resources: to monitor this transition to circularity, we have developed an \u201cEconomic CircularAbility\u201d KPI, which takes the Group\u2019s overall EBITDA (in euros) and compares it with the amount of resources consumed, both fuel and raw materials, throughout the value chain by the different business activities (expressed in tons). Enel has committed to doubling its performance in relation to this KPI by 2030 compared to 2020, i.e. to halve the amount of resources consumed compared to the EBITDA generated. | 23 | Businesses and trade associations Civil society and local and global communities Customers Suppliers and contractors | Circular economy |\n| Enel guarantees investments aimed at supporting the energy transition while ensuring the continuous maintenance of existing plants to make them resilient and enable them to meet the challenges of climate change. | 8 | Businesses and trade associations Civil society and local and global communities Enel people Customers Suppliers and contractors | Zero emissions ambition |\nThe impacts and associated material topics that have been determined through this process are used to identify the financial risks and opportunities related to the organization's impacts and for financial assessment purposes.\n\nAs regards financial materiality, in 2022 the Group conducted an assessment, analyzing and identifying the material topics from a financial perspective, namely those that affect or could affect the Company's financial condition or operating results, and are therefore most relevant to investors.\n\nThe financial materiality analysis was performed by each Local Sustainability and Holding unit, in order to assess the significance of impacts arising from the external context. This entailed the involvement of relevant stakeholders and experts within the organization who have a close relationship with the main stakeholders, and thus a comprehensive view on sustainability aspects related to risks and opportunities that influence or may influence substantially the Company's cash flows, development, performance, positioning, cost of capital or access to borrowings in the short, medium or long term.\n\nIn conducting the financial materiality analysis, Enel also considered the relevance of ESG topics according to the SASB Standard for the prevailing Electric Utilities sector and the Gas Utilities, Solar Technology and Wind Technology sectors.\n\nOn the basis of the financial materiality assessment, for reporting purposes the most significant potential positive and negative impacts were selected according to their highest degree of significance for each topic of the materiality analysis. The table below shows:\n\n- the most significant impacts \u2013 associated with ESG megatrends, the material topic (1st, 2nd, 3rd Level) and related GRI \u2013 both positive and negative in suffered directly and indirectly by the Company from the external context;\n- the time horizon for their occurrence (short-, medium- or long-term);\n- impact management: the Company strategies and performance, in line with the management of the main types of risk faced by the Enel Group;\n- alignment with the SASB Standard for the prevailing Electric Utilities sector and the Gas Utilities, Solar Technology and Wind Technology sectors, and the material topic (1st Level) related to the impact;\n- additional information: whether the reported impact is or could be a human rights concern; the reference SDGs; the phase of the value chain affected by the impact; the stakeholders that can or could be positively or negatively affected by the impact; whether the topic related to the reported impact is a priority for the stakeholders involved in the materiality analysis process; reference to the Sustainability Plan and to the chapter of the Report that describes in detail the management methods and results related to the impact.\n\n---\n\n(4) For financial reporting input purposes, the financial materiality analysis looked at the actual and potential impacts suffered by the Company from a financial point of view. However, in order to select the most significant impacts for reporting, it focused on potential ones with a view to assessing the potential economic effects on the Company.\n| ESG megatrend | Material topic (I level) | Material topic (II, III level) | Description of the impact | Relevant GRI(2) | Duration(3) |\n|---------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|-------------|\n| Climate change, Resources preservation | Decarbonization of the energy mix | Climate change \u2013 Adaptation to extreme weather events | Promoting the establishment and timely implementation of adaptation plans to improve the resilience of plants to natural disasters and respond promptly to regulatory changes, helping to reduce potential costs and losses due to damage and/or operational failures | GRI 201: Economic performance | \u2b24\u2b24\u2b24 |}\n| Urbanization, Digital revolution | Infrastructure and networks | Improvement and development of networks \u2013 Improvement of quality in energy distribution | Increased investment in infrastructure resilience to reduce climate risk | System efficiency (EU12) | \u2b24\u2b24\u2b24 |}\n| Resources preservation | Preservation of ecosystems and environmental management | Environmental governance \u2013 Environmental policies | Anticipating changes in national and international legislation and standards through the adoption of an overcompliant strategy aimed at a role as a global environmental best performer with respect to the most stringent regulatory compliance requirements | GRI 2-27: Compliance with laws and regulations | \u2b24\u2b24\u2b24 |}\n| Well-being | Occupational health and safety | Worker safety \u2013 Promotion of a worker safety culture | Decrease in the number of workplace injuries to workers and contractors, thanks to an adequate social and cultural context on health and safety topics | GRI 403: Occupational health and safety | \u2b24\u2b24\u2b24 |}\n| New governance models | Sound governance and fair corporate conduct | Fairness and transparency in communication \u2013 Fairness and transparency of ESG information | Positive financial performance as a result of the implementation of good corporate governance practices, relevant for key ESG indices and investors | GRI 2-2-23: Policy commitments; 2-24: Embedding policy commitments; 2-25: Processes to remediate negative impacts | \u2b24\u2b24\u2b24 |}\n| Increase in inequalities | Sustainable supply chain | Responsible management of the procurement of goods, services and work \u2013 Integration of environmental, safety and sustainability criteria and performance in purchasing management | Improving brand reputation by working with sustainability-compliant suppliers | GRI 204: Procurement practices | \u2b24\u2b24\u2b24 |}\n| New economy, Digital revolution, New mobility, Urbanization | Products and services for electrification and digitalization | New technologies and solutions for Homes, Condominiums, Cities, Industry and financial activities | Changes in consumer behaviour towards more sustainable, electrified and digitalized solutions | GRI 308: Supplier Environmental Assessment | \u2b24\u2b24\u2b24 |}\n| New economy, Resources preservation | Innovation, circular economy and digital transformation | Circular economy \u2013 Use of sustainable inputs, Dissemination of circular economy culture | Increased reuse of materials thanks to the adoption of circular economy practices | GRI 301: Materials | \u2b24\u2b24\u2b24 |}\n| New economy, New governance models | Economic and financial value creation | Investment attraction | Creation of new markets and sustainable finance products consistent with the investment framework, activating greater public resources for decarbonization and access to financial resources in line with energy transition objectives and the related impact on costs and on finance charges; introduction of subsidised support tools (funds and calls) for the transition. | GRI 201: Economic performance | \u2b24\u2b24\u2b24 |}\n\n(2) \u201c-\u201d is reported where the material topic is not currently covered by a specific GRI\n(3) Duration: \u2b24\u2b24\u2b24 Short term (up to 1 year) \u2b24\u2b24\u2b24 Medium term (2 to 5 years) \u2b24\u2b24\u2b24 Long term (>5 years)\n### Impact management\n\nThe Group adopts solutions for adaptation to weather and climate events in order to manage effectively chronic and acute phenomena of interest for each activity and Business Line. Adaptation solutions may concern both actions implemented in short-term and long-term decision making, such as the planning of investments in response to climate phenomena. Adaptation activities also include procedures, policies and best practices. For new investments, action can also be taken early in the design and construction phase to reduce the impact of climate risks by through risk and vulnerability assessments at the design stage, and to take any chronic effects into account (e.g. the inclusion of climate scenarios in long-term renewable resource estimates).\n\nIn the Enel Grids Business Line, the Enel Group has adopted an approach known as \u201c4R\u201d to cope with extreme weather events (1. Risk Prevention; 2. Readiness; 3. Response; 4. Recovery). In a suitable policy, it defines the measures required, both when preparing for an emergency on the grid, and to quickly restore service ex post, i.e. once the climatic events have caused damage to the assets and/or disconnections.\n\nEnel plays an active and leadership role in international meetings and in the discussion and application of new national and international standards regarding environmental topics in order to align and anticipate their organizational implications. A structured control plan combined with actions and improvement objectives inspired by the best environmental and social practices, with requirements higher than those linked to simple environmental regulatory compliance, mitigates the risk of impacts on the environment and on human rights, of legal disputes and misalignment with the benchmark international standards that represent best practices.\n\nEnel considers the health, safety and psychological and physical well-being of individuals to be the most precious asset to be protected at all times of life, at work, at home and during leisure time. In this context, the Group promotes a context based on principles of health and safety, through global and local awareness raising campaigns to promote healthy lifestyles, screening programs aimed at preventing the onset of illnesses, vaccination campaigns and availability of medical services. This structured approach is described in the new version of the \u201cHealth and Well-being\u201d Policy, and defines in three main steps \u2013 health surveillance, prevention and well-being \u2013 the path for promoting good health and well-being. Enel\u2019s commitment is also demonstrated in the Group\u2019s Policy on Human Rights, the \u201cDeclaration of Commitment to Health and Safety\u201d and the \u201cStop Work Policy\u201d.\n\nEnel has adopted as part of its corporate governance specific compliance programs, i.e. the Code of Ethics, the Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan (\u201cZTC Plan\u201d), the Policy on Human Rights, the Policy on International sanctions, the Enel Global Compliance Program (\u201cEGCP\u201d), the Model pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/01 and other national compliance programs adopted by Group companies in accordance with their national legislation. Furthermore, to further pursue its commitment to fighting corruption, Enel voluntarily decided to certify its Anti-Bribery Management System (SGPG) in compliance with the requirements of international standard ISO 37001:2016 (international certification of anti-bribery management systems).\n\nEnel promotes partnerships with companies that maximize their positive impacts on the environment and has created numerous partnerships with companies on the topics of decarbonization, circularity, human rights and supply chain mapping, with the aim of sharing common practices and approaches and of pushing the supply chain towards the sustainability standards required by the international community.\n\nThe energy sector is changing, and at the same time the way we use energy is evolving. Enel is therefore committed to creating and offering individuals, companies and government bodies products and services to make everyday life, from mobility to home automation, easier and more efficient.\n\nWe apply the circular economy throughout the goods lifecycle: from the design or purchase stages through to their use and reuse in a new cycle at the end of their service life. In order to minimize the use of scarce natural resources, Enel defines and implements circular economy practices along all business lines, involving both its supply chain and end customers.\n\nAt Enel, sustainable finance plays a crucial role in supporting the growth of the Group which, through the recognition of the value of sustainability, contributes to a gradual reduction in the cost of debt. Sustainable finance means synergy between private and public finance. Private finance conveys private capital towards sustainable investments, i.e. for the benefit of companies whose strategic action is intended to achieve certain sustainability objectives, reflecting the economic and financial value of sustainability in a lower cost of debt. Public finance, on the other hand, stimulates the creation of sustainable investments, through grants and loans at subsidized interest rates.\n\n### Materiality analysis\n\n| Relev-ant SDG | Stakeholders involved | Stage in value chain | Ref. in Sustain-ability Plan and 2022 Sustainability Report chapter |\n|---------------|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 13            | Businesses and trade associations, Civil society and local and global communities, Customers, Financial community, Enel people, Institutions, Media, Suppliers and contractors | Zero emissions ambition | |\n| 9             | Businesses and trade associations, Civil society and local and global communities, Customers | Clean electrification | |\n| 8             | Enel people, Suppliers and contractors | Occupational health and safety | |\n| 16            | Financial community, Businesses and trade associations | Sound governance, Our commitment to continuous improvement | |\n| 15            | Financial community, Suppliers and contractors | Sustainable supply chain | |\n| 21            | Customers | Clean electrification, Digitalization | |\n| 19            | Businesses and trade associations, Civil society and local and global communities, Suppliers and contractors | Circular economy | |\n| 8             | Businesses and trade associations, Financial community, Institutions | Zero emissions ambition, Our commitment to continuous improvement | |\n### Table of the most significant impacts\n\n| ESG megatrend | Material topic (I level) | Material topic (II, III level) | Description of the impact | Relevant GRI(3) | Duration(4) |\n|---------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|-------------|\n| **Climate change** | Decarbonization of the energy mix(2) | Climate change \u2013 Adaptation to extreme weather events(2) | Increase in extreme weather events (e.g. cyclones, droughts, floods, storms, heat waves and fires) due to climate change, resulting in damage or reduced efficiency of power generation and distribution facilities and supporting infrastructure, causing capacity to be downgraded, operations temporarily stopped or shut down completely. | GRI 201: Economic performance | \u2b24\u2b24\u2b24 | |\n| **Urbanization, Digital revolution** | Infrastructure and networks | Operational grid management \u2013 Grid maintenance | Potential damage to the network caused by third parties causing malfunctions in the continuity of the service provided and with possible penalties for failure to restore within the established time | DMA (former EU23): Access to energy System efficiency (EU12) | \u2b24\u2b24\u2b24 | |\n| **Resources preservation** | Preservation of ecosystems and environmental management | Environmental governance \u2013 Environmental policies | Stricter and emerging legislation on activities, products and/or services aimed at reducing the environmental impact on nature and local communities, resulting in increased operating costs and fines, loss of licenses and/or revenues or blocked assets | GRI 2-27: Compliance with laws and regulations | \u2b24\u2b24\u2b24 | |\n| **Well-being** | Occupational health and safety | Worker safety \u2013 Promotion of a worker safety culture Safety of contractors working at Enel sites \u2013 Promotion of a safety culture among contractors working at Enel sites | Increase in the number of workplace injuries to workers and contractors, due to an inadequate social and cultural context on health and safety topics | GRI 403: Occupational health and safety GRI 410: Safety practices | \u2b24\u2b24\u2b24 | |\n| **Inclusion and gender equality, Future work** | People management, development and motivation | People development \u2013 Upskilling and Reskilling | Lack of institutional support to incentivize and promote new skills and job opportunities in the organization | GRI 404: Training and Education | \u2b24\u2b24\u2b24 | |\n| **New governance models** | Sound governance and fair corporate conduct | Fairness in management conduct | Rising demand for corporate transparency and accountability from the financial community, impacting ESG ratings and securities performance | GRI 1: Foundation GRI 2-2-22: Statement on sustainable development strategy; 2-23: Policy commitments GRI 2-2-23: Policy commitments; 2-24: Embedding policy commitments GRI 205: Anti-corruption GRI 206: Anti-competitive behavior GRI 415: Public policy | \u2b24\u2b24\u2b24 | |\n\n---\n\n(1) SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board)\n\n(2) The climate and biodiversity crises are linked. As stated in the report by the workshop co-sponsored by IPBES-IPCC on biodiversity and climate change, \u201climiting global warming to ensure a habitable climate and protecting biodiversity are mutually supporting goals, and their achievement is essential for sustainably and equitably providing benefits to people. Climate change is one of the main causes of biodiversity loss, given that the destruction of ecosystems undermines nature\u2019s ability to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to protect itself from extreme weather conditions, thus accelerating climate change and increasing its vulnerability.\u201d\n\n(3) \u201c-\u201d is reported where the material topic is not currently covered by a specific GRI.\n\n(4) Duration: \u2b24\u2b24\u2b24 Short term (up to 1 year) \u2b24\u2b24\u2b24 Medium term (2 to 5 years) \u2b24\u2b24\u2b24 Long term (>5 years)\nEnel makes use of procedures to manage adverse events through monitoring activities, weather forecasts and short-, medium- and long-term scenario analysis, to provide for the definition of actions to protect and increase resilience, both for existing assets and for those under construction. Also, best practices are implemented in relation to physical events to ensure prompt recovery of plant and grid operating conditions following adverse events.\n\nEnel promptly monitors network operations, to carry out maintenance on the infrastructure existing in all countries, to improve the quality of the service delivered and reduce the number and duration of outages (SAIDI and SAIFI).\n\nIn relation to risks that may arise from regulatory factors and developments in legislation, Enel has intensified its relations with institutional bodies, and is proactive in the removal/reduction of all potential elements that could compromise its positive environmental and social impact.\n\nThe health, safety and psychological and physical well-being of individuals is the most precious asset to be protected at all times of life. In order to promote a suitable context in terms of health, safety and well-being within the perimeter of the Enel Group, with the aim of implementing plans composed of preventive measures and measures to protect the health of workers and anyone working for the Group, on both a local and global level. A listening and psychological support service was renewed for 2022, the purpose of which is to provide workers with a customized help program in an anonymous, free and confidential manner.\n\nEnel has developed upskilling and reskilling programs to support the energy transition: upskilling programs focus on developing existing professional skills, adding new skills based on the needs dictated by innovative technologies and processes; reskilling programs are aimed at creating new professional profiles, replacing skills that have become obsolete or are no longer needed, and which enable people to work on new activities.\n\nEnel maintains dialogue with investors based on principles of fairness and transparency, in compliance with EU and national regulations on market abuse, as well as in line with international best practices. In order to regulate the methods for developing dialog with the financial community, Enel has adopted a specific Policy (the \u201cEngagement Policy\u201d), which clarified to a large extent the practices already followed by Enel, and also took into account the best practices adopted with regard to corporate governance. By means of dialog with shareholders and bondholders, the Enel Investor Relations unit constantly collects feedback on how to integrate and improve the Group\u2019s reporting process and make its communications as effective as possible, meeting the needs of the financial markets.\n\n| Impact management | Relevant SDG | Stakeholders involved | Stage in value chain | Ref. in Sustainability Plan and 2022 Sustainability Report chapter |\n|-------------------|-------------|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Enel makes use of procedures to manage adverse events through monitoring activities, weather forecasts and short-, medium- and long-term scenario analysis, to provide for the definition of actions to protect and increase resilience, both for existing assets and for those under construction. Also, best practices are implemented in relation to physical events to ensure prompt recovery of plant and grid operating conditions following adverse events. | | | | |\n| Enel promptly monitors network operations, to carry out maintenance on the infrastructure existing in all countries, to improve the quality of the service delivered and reduce the number and duration of outages (SAIDI and SAIFI). | | | | |\n| In relation to risks that may arise from regulatory factors and developments in legislation, Enel has intensified its relations with institutional bodies, and is proactive in the removal/reduction of all potential elements that could compromise its positive environmental and social impact. | | | | |\n| The health, safety and psychological and physical well-being of individuals is the most precious asset to be protected at all times of life. In order to promote a suitable context in terms of health, safety and well-being within the perimeter of the Enel Group, with the aim of implementing plans composed of preventive measures and measures to protect the health of workers and anyone working for the Group, on both a local and global level. A listening and psychological support service was renewed for 2022, the purpose of which is to provide workers with a customized help program in an anonymous, free and confidential manner. | | | | |\n| Enel has developed upskilling and reskilling programs to support the energy transition: upskilling programs focus on developing existing professional skills, adding new skills based on the needs dictated by innovative technologies and processes; reskilling programs are aimed at creating new professional profiles, replacing skills that have become obsolete or are no longer needed, and which enable people to work on new activities. | | | | |\n| Enel maintains dialogue with investors based on principles of fairness and transparency, in compliance with EU and national regulations on market abuse, as well as in line with international best practices. In order to regulate the methods for developing dialog with the financial community, Enel has adopted a specific Policy (the \u201cEngagement Policy\u201d), which clarified to a large extent the practices already followed by Enel, and also took into account the best practices adopted with regard to corporate governance.

This commitment is also reflected in the Group\u2019s Policy on Human Rights. The Group has designed and adopted a holistic framework of processes aimed at governance of cyber security topics, applicable across the board to the Information Technology (IT), Operational Technology (OT) and Internet of Things (IoT) sectors. Moreover, the Group has defined and adopted a risk management method for IT security in accordance with risk-based and \u201ccyber security by design\u201d approaches, by integrating the safety requirements along the entire solution and service life cycle. In particular, the framework adopted by the Group addresses the monitoring of cyber risks, through eight processes aimed at: ensuring cyber security governance by guiding the strategy and issuing policies and procedures to respond to the main existing and emerging national and international regulations on cyber security; identifying and assessing cyber risks, by defining and implementing the related processing actions; providing architectural guidelines and engineering support for the protection of the Group\u2019s solutions and infrastructures (IT/OT/IoT); monitoring the IT security posture through process and technology checks; guiding and managing cyber incident prevention and response activities; managing the entire life cycle of the Group\u2019s digital identities and access control; guiding and managing training and awareness initiatives on cyber security at Group level, by leveraging behaviour and the human factor. |  | Enel people Civil society and local and global communities Customers | Digitalization |  |\n| In relation to risks that may arise from regulatory factors, relations were intensified with local government and regulatory bodies, adopting an approach based on transparency, collaboration and proactiveness in addressing and removing sources of instability of the legislative and regulatory framework. In addition, for improved orientation of the strategic development guidelines, the evolution of the external context and the competitive landscape are constantly monitored, both inside and outside the utilities world. |  | Businesses and trade associations Civil society and local and global communities Customers Financial community Institutions Suppliers and contractors | Zero-emissions ambition |  |\nThe material topics\n\nThe impact analysis model is of fundamental importance as it enables the Company to identify the material topics and focus on the best way to manage them, both in terms of risk management as well as in terms of strengthening opportunities. In addition, the Company must recognize its strategic priorities, taking into account also the view of its stakeholders. Identifying the priority ESG topics with which the Company wants to engage therefore strengthens the profile of impact management.\n\nThe assessment of the impacts generated and suffered and their relative significance guides the identification of the material topics: identify, within each 1st Level material topic, which 2nd-3rd level topics are material. The result of this analysis are used to help identify and define the objectives to be included in the Strategic Plan and the Sustainability Plan, the achievement of which is contributed to by the various Group Functions and Business Lines, as well as the topics covered by the Sustainability Report and other Corporate Reporting documents.\n\nThe list of 1st, 2nd and 3rd Level material topics is provided below together with the respective reference GRI as a monitoring and management indicator and the reference to the Sustainability Plan and Sustainability Report 2022.\n## Material topics\n\n| Material topics (1st level) | Material topics (2nd, 3rd level) | GRI | Ref.

be developed where in-house redevelopment is not feasible.\nClimate change represents the main global challenge of this century and Enel plays an active role in the fight against it, by leading the global energy transition towards zero emissions.\n\nAs one of the first signatories of the 2019 \u201cBusiness Ambition for 1.5 \u00b0C\u201d campaign promoted by United Nations, Enel Group has publicly declared its commitment to develop a business model in line with the Paris Agreement (COP 21) objectives, to limit the average global temperature increase to 1.5 \u00b0C.\n\nIn 2021, we have brought forward our commitment to zero emissions by ten years, from 2050 to 2040.\n\nIn 2022, we reached a historic new milestone by defining a decarbonization roadmap that covers both direct and indirect emissions throughout the Group\u2019s value chain. Specifically, four targets have been defined, certified by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and in line with keeping global warming within 1.5 \u00b0C.\n\nThe roadmap currently envisages reducing all direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by around 99% by 2040 compared to 2017 throughout the value chain, beyond the overall threshold set by SBTi (90%). The Group aims to achieve a 100% reduction in all emissions, with a view of overcoming exogenous factors in the short to medium term such as the development of new technological solutions in the supply chain at large-scale or the improvement of certain market conditions and policies.\n\nEnel aims to promote electrification solutions powered by renewable sources, complete the phase-out of fossil fuels, accelerate renewable sources development, and digitize and upgrade networks. Specifically:\n\n- **by 2025**, Enel will cover about 90% of its fixed-price sales with carbon-free electricity, bringing renewables to about 75% of total production. In addition, progress towards digitalization of networks will increase the share of digitalized customers to around 80%.\n- **by 2027**, Enel will complete the phase-out of all its coal-fired power plants.\n- **by 2030**, around 85% of the installed capacity will be renewable and 100% of network customers will be fully digitalized.\n- **by 2040**, all installed capacity will be 100% renewable, the Group will have phased-out both thermoelectric generation and retail gas activities and 100% of the electricity sold will be produced from renewable sources.\n\n(1) Includes generation from managed capacity of 25 TWh in 2025.\nEnel will also lead its customers towards a decarbonized electrification of their consumption. Firstly, by increasing the share of renewable electricity consumption, Enel customers will reduce their indirect Scope 2 emissions; secondly, by expanding the portfolio of products and services to accelerate the electrification of other sectors, such as transport and construction, while promoting energy efficiency solutions, customers will also reduce their direct Scope 1 emissions.\n\nThrough its business strategy, the Group is committed to establish drivers, actions and investments required to complete the decarbonization and electrification roadmap, and identifying, assessing and managing the main climate risks and business opportunities emerging from the energy transition.\n\nParticular attention is placed on the climate change adaptation policies to increase the resilience of the assets along the entire value chain, thereby limiting potentially negative impact and guaranteeing a safe and sustainable energy service in all the countries in which the Group operates.\n\nEnel is committed to carry out its direct and indirect public advocacy action in line with the Paris Agreement and its objective of limiting global warming within 1.5 \u00b0C through the engagement of institutional stakeholders, trade associations, non-governmental organizations and academics. Enel promotes its point of view on public policies in the fight against climate change and on the pathways of decarbonization and electrification.\n\nIn addition, Enel is fully aware of the intrinsic link between climate change and nature loss. Rising temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns and extreme weather events impact significantly on ecosystems, forests and biodiversity. The decline of nature also affects the resilience of ecosystems to climate change, and the ability to capture carbon and generate benefits for society. Therefore, Enel\u2019s business model aims to synergistically address climate change and promote the protection and conservation of nature, as an essential factor in its corporate strategy and everyday operations.\n\nSimilarly, there is a strong link between climate change and the social dimension. An active role in the fight against climate change focusing on people requires of decarbonization strategies that stimulate social inclusion, and at the same time favors decent work, the pillars of which \u2013 according to the International Labour Organization \u2013 are full productive employment, the guarantee of rights at work, the expansion of social protection, and the development of social dialogue. As such, Enel fully supports the principles of a just transition, so that no one is left behind even in the short term, and recognizes the relevance for its business of the social impacts arising from its climate strategy, aimed at the progressive reduction of emissions in line with the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn addition, as a result of a solid corporate governance system that defines roles and responsibilities, Enel\u2019s Board of Directors and Management oversee the main decisions regarding climate.\n\nIn order to guarantee increased transparency in its communications and relationships with its stakeholders, the Group periodically reports on its related activities around climate change in line with the international standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and is publicly committed to adopting the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) of the Financial Stability Board. The guidance from the \u201cEnhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures\u201d of the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), the standards issued on the EFRAG website, and the ISSB\u2019s recently published exposure draft are also taken into account.\n\nFor details on the alignment of the structure of the chapter relating to the TCFD recommendations, please see the TCFD Content Index in the 2022 Sustainability Report.\nEnel\u2019s roadmap to decarbonization and electrification\n\nTCFD: Metrics & Targets\n\nIn 2022, Enel carried out a full update of its decarbonization roadmap. The process was validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative according to the criteria and recommendations related to short-term objectives and according to the SBTi Corporate Net Zero standard. This review included updating existing medium-term (2030) and long-term (2040) objectives, as well as setting new targets, all aligned to a 1.5 \u00b0C pathway, as defined by the SBTi, according to IPCC scenarios and other international benchmarks.\n\nThe main updates are:\n\n- 2017 baseline was restated for all targets to exclude those direct and indirect GHG emissions from assets disposed in 2017-2022 period, including thermoelectric and renewable plants and energy distribution assets that were disposed or are no longer consolidated within Enel\u2019s financial perimeter, in accordance with the GHG Protocol and SBTi guidelines;\n- target ambition on Scope 1 GHG emissions intensity relating to power generation has been improved, from 82 gCO\u2082eq/kWh to 72 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2030. This target covers all greenhouse gas emissions (including CO\u2082, CH\u2084 and N\u2082O) deriving from the power generation process with respect to total electricity and heat generated by the Group (excluding pumped storage generation to avoid possible double counting in the Scope 2 emissions calculation).\n\nScope 1 GHG emissions intensity relating to power generation (gCO\u2082eq/kWh)\n\n![Graph showing Scope 1 GHG emissions intensity]\n\n(1) The 2017 baseline has been restated from 416 gCO\u2082eq/kWh to 365 gCO\u2082eq/kWh to exclude GHG emissions from assets disposed in 2017-2022 period, in accordance with SBTi.\n\n(2) 2022 value has not been restated and includes the GHG emissions of assets in operation during 2022 and disposed before the end of the year, according to the consolidation guidelines of the Sustainability Report. The figure, excluding GHG emissions by these assets, is 217 gCO\u2082eq/kWh, down 40% compared to the restated baseline.\n\n(3) Target previously validated by SBTi in 2020 (1.5 \u00b0C pathway) of 82 gCO\u2082eq/kWh.\n**target ambition on Scope 1 and 3 GHG emissions intensity relating to Integrated Power** has been improved, from 83 gCO\u2082eq/kWh to 73 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2030. This target is calculated as the combination of direct Group GHG emissions (Scope 1 \u2013 including CO\u2082, CH\u2084, and N\u2082O) from electricity and heat generation and Group indirect GHG emissions (Scope 3) from power generation electricity purchased and sold to end customers (an element of the 3-Fuel and Energy Related Activities subcategory of the GHG protocol Scope 3 standard), divided by power generation (including heat and excluding pumped power storage) and purchase of electricity.\n\n**Scope 1 and 3 GHG emissions intensity relating to Integrated Power (gCO\u2082eq/kWh)**\n\n![Graph showing Scope 1 and 3 GHG emissions intensity]\n\n(1) The 2017 baseline has been restated from 373 gCO\u2082eq/kWh to 332 gCO\u2082eq/kWh to exclude GHG emissions from assets disposed in 2017-2022 period, in accordance with SBTi.\n\n(2) The 2022 value has not been restated and includes the GHG emissions from assets in operation during 2022 and disposed before the end of the year, according to the consolidation guidelines of the Sustainability Report. The figure, excluding GHG emissions from these assets, is 217 gCO\u2082eq/kWh, down 40% compared to the restated baseline.\n\n**target ambition on absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions relating to Gas Retail** has been significantly improved from 21.2 MtCO\u2082eq to 11.4 MtCO\u2082eq by 2030, to increase the level of alignment with temperature scenarios of the Paris Agreement, from a previous 2 \u00b0C pathway to one of 1.5 \u00b0C, to which the target is now aligned:\n\n**Absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions relating to Gas Retail (MtCO\u2082eq)**\n\n![Graph showing absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions]\n\n(1) Target previously validated by SBTi in 2019 (WB2C scenario) of 21.2 MtCO\u2082eq.\n\u2022 new target has been defined for additional absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. The target covers i) Scope 1 GHG emissions from vehicles fleet and buildings, and losses of SF\u2086 in distribution assets; ii) all Scope 2 emissions; iii) Scope 3 emissions from the supply chain and all other activities related to fuel purchase and transportation. This objective provides for different levels of coverage of GHG emissions deriving from the supply chain for the 2030 and 2040 targets, allowed by SBTi methodology, which translate into two decarbonization curves:\n  - 2017-2030 roadmap covers specific supply chain categories that accounted for 40% of supplier emissions in 2017;\n  - 2017-2040 roadmap covers all supply categories included in the 2017-2030 roadmap and additional ones, which account for 54% of supplier emissions in 2017.\n\nThe first three targets envisage a 100% reduction in emissions generated by 2040, as the Group will produce and sell 100% of energy from renewable sources by then and will no longer maintain a presence in the retail gas market. The fourth objective currently envisages a 90% reduction by 2040 from 2017, with a residual volume of less than 2.5 MtCO\u2082eq, which will be neutralized through carbon removal in the event that the current external factors (linked to the supply chain, the market and the regulatory frameworks) that prevent Enel from mitigating them will also be present after 2040.\n\nThe four targets cover the 93.3% of the total direct and indirect GHG emissions reported by Enel in 2022. Specifically:\n  \u2022 98.6% of Scope 1 GHG emissions. Minor sources of GHG emissions were excluded as they were not directly related to the combustion process for electricity generation or the power distribution activity (such as GHG emissions from ancillary services in renewable power plants and distribution sites, CH\u2084 leakage in gas-fired plants, and SF\u2086 leakage in thermal and renewable plants) or of biogenic origin (such as CH\u2084 emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs);\n  \u2022 100% of Scope 2 emissions, including all indirect emissions from electricity consumption and technical grid losses;\n  \u2022 87% of Scope 3 emissions for the target set for 2030, compared to 90% for the target set for 2040. Specific categories of the supply chain have been excluded from the scope of the targets.\n### GHG targets\n\n| GHG targets | Core business activity | GHG sources covered (GHG Protocol) | Timing | GHG targets | Climatic scenario | Main drivers and actions |\n|-------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------------|\n|             |                        |                                   |        |             |                   | \u2022 Gradual phase-out of coal-fired capacity over the period 2023-2025 (percentage weight of coal-fired capacity in consolidated capacity from about 7% in 2022 to less than 0.5% in 2025). |\n|             |                        |                                   |        |             |                   | \u2022 Invest 15 billion euros to accelerate the development of renewable energy by installing 17 GW of new renewable capacity (including about 13 GW at consolidated level) and 4 GW of BESS in the period 2023-2025, reaching 75 GW of renewable capacity (including 4 GW of BESS) by 2025. |\n|             |                        |                                   |        |             |                   | \u2022 Continue the process of decarbonization of electricity generation, thanks to a Group-wide investment plan that will be confirmed at the annual levels of the 2023-2025 plan, reaching a managed capacity of more than 130 GW by 2030, thus bringing the Group\u2019s generation facilities to consist of about 85% renewable plants. |\n|             |                        |                                   |        |             |                   | \u2022 Exit the coal-fired generation business on a global scale by 2027. |\n|             |                        |                                   |        |             |                   | \u2022 Exit the thermal electricity generation business, achieving a 100% renewable energy mix. |\n|             |                        |                                   |        |             |                   | \u2022 No use of carbon removal technologies |\n\n#### Intensity of GHG Scope 1 emissions relating to power generation\n\n- **Electricity generation**\n  -

Technological development, in particular in the area of renewable energies, has completely transformed this scenario by making electricity one of the main solutions for reducing the carbon footprint worldwide. Enel is aware of these impacts and implements specific actions to minimize them, promoting the decarbonization of the energy system and the electrification of the energy demand. As a result, this reduces the greenhouse gas emissions along the entire value chain.\n\nEnel\u2019s **power generation from fossil fuels** (mainly gas and coal) traditionally represents the main source of greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, in 2022 the direct emissions (Scope 1) relating to power generation from fossil fuels were about 52.1 mil t eq CO\u2082, whereas indirect emissions (Scope 3) relating to the extraction and transport of fuels were 10.3 mil t eq of CO\u2082. Enel is reducing this impact by accelerating the phase out of coal-fired plants, with a reduction of capacity in 2022 of around 2.5 GW compared to 2021. In parallel, the Group is increasing the development of renewable capacity that, together with the contribution of nuclear generation, has avoided 81.6 mil t eq of CO\u2082 emissions. Furthermore, Enel is actively committed to the development of electricity storage systems that support the integration of renewable capacity, with a total installed capacity of 316 MW in 2022. Decarbonization of the energy mix also has a positive impact on the reduction of customers\u2019 indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 2) associated with the acquisition of electricity to cover their energy demand.\n\n**Electricity grids\u2019 management** involves indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 2) associated with technical energy losses on the grid of 3.3 mil t eq of CO\u2082 in 2022 (according to the \u201clocation based\u201d calculation methodology). Enel is actively investing in the digitalization and automation of the electricity grid to reduce these losses and increase reliability, while promoting the diffusion of renewables in the energy system.\n\nConcerning the **end customer**, the use of the products sold by Enel\u2019s customers generates GHG emissions that are accounted for as indirect (Scope 3). In particular, the emissions connected to the purchase of electricity to be sold to customers equaled approximately 28.4 mil t eq of CO\u2082, whereas those related to the use of gas sold equaled 22.9 mil t eq of CO\u2082. Enel regularly monitors these emissions and adopts measures aimed at minimizing them. Furthermore, it offers its customers technical solutions to reduce carbon emissions related to their energy consumption in a wide range of sectors, including transport, property management as well as industrial processes and services. For example, with Enel X the Group is promoting the deployment of owned public charging infrastructure for electric vehicles (22,600 charging points installed in 2022), the development of energy efficiency solutions, distributed generation, consultancy services, smart public lighting and circular cities.\n\nEmissions related to the **activities of the Group\u2019s suppliers** amounted to 14.2 mil t eq of CO\u2082 in 2022. To reduce this impact, Enel adopts a circular procurement approach and includes assessments of the carbon footprint of the products and services involved in the purchasing processes and encourages their reduction.\nAdvocacy about climate change policies\n\nWithin the framework of its commitment to climate change, Enel is firmly committed to promoting and defining:\n\n- **ambitious climate and decarbonization targets** consistent with the objectives set by the Paris Agreement;\n- **effective and efficient implementation mechanisms** capable of exploiting market dynamics, by fully supporting the role of carbon pricing;\n- **constant dialog on climate issues within multi-stakeholder initiatives**, actively contributing to groups and coalitions such as the Just Transition Think Lab and Caring for Climate under the UN Global Compact, the SOS 1.5 and Policy Advocacy and Member Mobilization (PAMM) projects of the WBCSD (World Business Council for Sustainable Development), and the World Bank\u2019s Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition (CPLC);\n- **private sector leadership on decarbonization** through its continued participation in initiatives such as the CEO Alliance, WEF CEO Climate Leaders Alliance, IETA (International Emissions Trading Association), FMC (First Movers Coalition), and regional and national trade associations.\n\nEnel is committed to ensuring that its direct advocacy activities are aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, involving institutional stakeholders, trade associations, non-governmental organizations and academia, in order to promote the Group\u2019s vision on climate and policies to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. Stakeholder engagement contributes to the evolution of the regulatory framework towards ambitious climate goals and promotes an economy in which carbon pricing plays a fundamental role in orientating long-term investments.\n\nIn particular, Enel interacts directly with policy makers, contributes to the positioning of trade associations, and engages with a broader set of stakeholders to build consensus and support for specific policy proposals. Enel supports the integration of carbon pricing into the decision-making process in all countries where it operates. In doing so, it underlines the importance of well-functioning mechanisms for carbon taxation and emissions trading. These must be able to provide short- and medium-term predictability to support market efficiency, as well as strong long-term price signals to support investment and innovation.\n\nThe worldwide coordination of Enel\u2019s global public policy positioning on climate is ensured by the Energy and Climate Policies unit. This unit is responsible for developing global scenarios and position papers on climate policies with the support of the Country and Global Business Lines. Its objective is to guide Enel\u2019s national and local advocacy activities, thanks to a continuous dialog with institutions and the widest possible range of stakeholders active in the climate debate. In this sense, Enel is also committed to ensure continuous and full alignment with the objectives of the Paris Agreement within the associations of which it is a member.\n\nDuring 2022, the Group represented its interests and promoted its position vis-\u00e0-vis the European institutions (Commission, Parliament, Council) with the aim of orientating legislative proposals and decisions that could have affected the EU\u2019s Climate and Energy Policy Framework, and the Group\u2019s activities. In carrying out these activities, Enel is committed to acting in a transparent and responsible manner. In this sense, it is listed on the European Transparency Register, the specific activities of which are linked to the main EU legislative and/or policy proposals (including the European Green Deal, Fit for 55, the REPowerEU plan, ETS reform, Air Quality Directives, Sustainable Finance, State Aid and Competition, Hydrogen).\n\nThe dedicated website contains a public list of meetings Enel has held with the EU Commissioners, members of their Cabinets and EC Directors-General between December 2014 and January 2023. Specifically, for 2022, issues discussed included: the European Green Deal, Energy Taxation Directive (ETD), Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), the Renewable Energy Directive, and the ETS Directive. In addition, Enel\u2019s positions and responses to EU consultations (such as the Critical Raw Materials Act) are made public, together with a list of the main professional associations and think-tanks in which Enel is active.\n\nIn all countries, Enel\u2019s pursues its advocacy efforts through specific activities and broader stakeholder engagement on decarbonization and energy transition issues. The approach is similar to that adopted at global level. The objectives of the Enel Group\u2019s advocacy policy include promoting greater climate ambition, carbon pricing, accelerating the deployment of renewable technologies, developing and upgrading infrastructure through smart grid technologies to support the energy transition, and electrification as a means for decarbonizing energy end-uses. In this context, through the \u201cEnergy Transition Roadmap\u201d engagement\n\n---\n\n[2] https://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=6256831207-27&locale=en#en, number 6256831207-27. By registering, Enel signed the Transparency Register Code of Conduct, and also declared that it is bound by its own Code of Ethics.\nplatforms, Enel engages with a wide range of stakeholders on the definition and implementation of the actions needed to pursue the Paris Agreement goals. These platforms take decarbonization by 2050 as a starting point, then proceed to identify the technology mix needed to reach this and the medium-term goal for 2030, and to develop specific policy recommendations aimed at achieving this transformation.\n\nThe Group\u2019s positioning on the main climate policies\n\nDuring 2022, several regulatory and legislative events took place, both specific to the climate and concerning energy and environmental issues related to it. The number of dossiers on which Enel focuses its advocacy increases annually and, in particular, our main positions are as follows:\n\nGlobally:\n\n- as part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Enel has been active in promoting greater ambition in the implementation of the Transparency Governance Framework, in the full mobilization of carbon finance envisaged by the Paris Agreement, together with rapid development of international cooperation envisaged by Article 6 of the same Agreement. In this sense, Enel also played an active role during the various preparatory events for COP 27 in Sharm el-Sheikh. In particular, Enel has asked: to efficiently accelerate the energy transition by guiding the world\u2019s economies on the path to Net-Zero, as recalled by the latest IPCC Report; to prepare the stocktaking planned for COP 28; to catch up in mobilizing finance to support mitigation and adaptation in developing countries; finalizing the implementing provisions of Article 6 on cooperation in terms of climate change;\n\n- Enel promotes greater climate ambition in line with the Paris Agreement, in a just transition framework. Enel\u2019s advocacy in this area is implemented through ad hoc engagement on specific legislative proposals (e.g. the European Climate Law), but also through broader stakeholder engagement at national level through Enel\u2019s Energy Transition Roadmap platform (see above). Through such platforms, Enel promotes NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions) that fully reflect the highest possible climate ambition and are fully in line with the requirements of the Paris Agreement;\n\n- Enel has strongly promoted carbon pricing in the form of both carbon tax and emissions trading. In particular, Enel believes that the adoption of these mechanisms based on Cap and Trade systems should be preferred in industrialized economies and industrial sectors where operators can effectively manage and internalize the price signals recorded on the market in their decision-making processes. Conversely, carbon-pricing mechanisms should tend to take the form of carbon taxes in countries with weaker institutions and in sectors characterized by distributed emission sources, and where non-economic barriers are significant. The Enel Group strongly supports carbon pricing as a means to decarbonize economic systems efficiently and effectively around the world. Enel\u2019s positions on the adoption of carbon pricing are conveyed both directly and through participation in the activities of organizations such as IETA, CPLC, Eurelectric and WBCSD. In 2022, specific activities were dedicated and aimed at analyzing and promoting carbon pricing, at global, regional (EU and Latin America) and national (EU member states, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Guatemala, Panama, Costa Rica, Colombia and Peru) levels.\n\nAt European level:\n\n- The European Green Deal, together with recent acceleration as a result of the REPowerEU plan to reduce Europe\u2019s energy dependence, represents for Enel a unique opportunity to accelerate the EU\u2019s path to a fully decarbonized and sustainable economy, especially when aligned with the mobilization of significant resources to ensure a rapid recovery from the ongoing crises. For Enel, the EU\u2019s climate and environmental goals require a new industrial strategy to reach climate neutrality, and an action plan for the circular economy, pursuing the decarbonization of each sector. The energy sector must aim to be fully decarbonized ahead of other sectors, as such ensuring decarbonization through direct and indirect electrification. For example, the study \u201cPowering our buildings: how policies can support energy efficiency through building electrification\u201d, developed together with FIRE (Italian Federation for the Rational Use of Energy) and IEECP (Institute for European Energy and Climate Policy), addresses energy improvement and decarbonization of the building sector;\n\n- Enel has supported EU proposals for reform of the Emissions Trading System (ETS), which must be strengthened to pursue the EU\u2019s higher climate ambition and supported by a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. The revision of the ETS Directive is in line with Enel\u2019s positioning. The overall ambition of the scheme has been reinforced with a target of reducing emissions by 62% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. The EU ETS has been extended to new activities in hydrogen production and maritime transport. A separate ETS for transport and for the heating of buildings has been launched with differ-\nEnel has supported a revision of the Effort Sharing regulation that fully exploits the decarbonization potential of energy end-uses in the EU\u2019s increased climate ambition. The review aimed to update the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) targets of individual member States in an upwards direction, in line with the higher ambition of 2030. The ambition also needed to be aligned with 2050 climate neutrality, to avoid the technological lock-in of emitting technologies and infrastructure. However, the impact on prices and energy bills must be carefully managed when adopting the recently revised regulation;\n\n- Enel has welcomed the publication of the hydrogen and gas market decarbonization package by the European Commission. The package also includes the proposed regulation on reducing methane emissions throughout the value chain in the energy sector and introduces new requirements for measuring, reporting and verifying emissions, as well as emission abatement measures. In addition, the regulation also proposes rules to increase transparency on methane emissions associated with fossil fuel imports;\n\n- Enel supports the European Commission\u2019s proposal on an upward revision of the EU\u2019s 2030 energy efficiency target to at least 36% for final energy consumption and at least 39% for primary energy consumption to achieve the ambition of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Significant energy efficiency improvements are needed to achieve the Net-Zero emissions target by 2050. As such, the proposed revision of the Directive, as part of the \u201cDelivering on the European Green Deal\u201d package, raises the level of ambition of the EU\u2019s energy efficiency target and makes it binding;\n\n- Enel welcomes the Commission\u2019s initiative to review the Renewable Energy Directive and increase its ambition. It believes that the main contributions to efficient decarbonization of the energy sector, as well as buildings, heating and cooling, transportation and industry, will come from further end-use electrification (direct and indirect electrification for sectors that are difficult to abate emissions by means of green hydrogen). In this regard, low carbon fuels should be excluded from the scope of this Directive. Enel believes that the EU regulatory framework should provide long-term predictability for investors, as well as simplified and standardized authorization procedures. Finally, Enel supports a technology-neutral approach that at the same time creates the necessary conditions for the penetration of fully sustainable technologies;\n\n- as part of the European Commission\u2019s hydrogen strategy, the Enel Group actively promotes green hydrogen (generated by electrolysis powered by 100% renewable energy). Enel believes that this is the only truly sustainable generation pathway for hydrogen, powered by renewable sources with zero greenhouse gas emissions. Hydrogen is best used as a complement to electrification, not as a competitor. It has an efficient role in decarbonizing those parts of the economy that cannot be electrified easily or economically, for example, hard-to-abate sectors such as heavy industry, aviation and shipping. In addition, Enel participated in 2022, together with many other multinationals, in two different working groups within the \u201cEnergy Pathway\u201d project promoted by WBCSD, with the aim of participating in the discussion on how to stimulate the development of projects and, at the same time, the hydrogen market;\n\n- as part of its smart and sustainable mobility strategy, the Enel Group is actively promoting e-mobility as a key factor in reducing road transport emissions and contributing to the achievement of EU energy efficiency targets. Since 2011, the EU has been involved in the process of updating its transport policy framework to reduce emissions in this sector, particularly road transport. Mobility is a critical aspect of social inclusion and a determining factor in human well-being, especially for disadvantaged groups. Recognized as an essential service in the European pillar of social rights, transport meets a fundamental need in enabling citizens to integrate into society and the labor market. By far the most serious challenge facing the transport sector is to reduce its emissions significantly and become more sustainable. The European Green Deal calls for a 90% reduction in GHG emissions from transport so that the EU can become a climate neutral economy by 2050, including working towards a zero pollution ambition. In addition, in 2021 the European Commission unveiled the \u201cEU Urban Mobility Framework\u201d, complementing the proposed revised guidelines for the Trans-European Network. The new EU Urban Mobility Framework outlines a common list of measures and initiatives for with which EU cities can address the challenge of making their mobility more sustainable. Finally, in 2022 Enel participated in the\nMobility Decarbonization working group promoted by WBCSD, with the aim of encouraging the decarbonization of road transport, facilitating the development of new technologies for zero-emission vehicles and the creation of new charging infrastructure;\n\n- Enel fully supports the European building renovation strategy and actively participates in discussions on the proposed review of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. The building sector is one of the most lagging industries as regards decarbonization due to criticalities in the value chain, in building efficiency, and in choice of energy source. Enel believes it can contribute substantially to the decarbonization of the building sector by installing efficient electrical technologies such as heat pumps, charging infrastructure for mobility and solar panels on roofs, improving building efficiency through electrification and digitalization, making buildings dynamic elements of the energy system through storage, remodeling of demand, and electric vehicle charging;\n\n- Enel has involved various stakeholders in the European Commission\u2019s New Circular Economy Action Plan, stressing the importance of ensuring the circularity of the main supply chains, particularly in relation to electric vehicles, batteries and renewable energy technologies. Furthermore, Enel\u2019s advocacy has highlighted the need to develop appropriate circular economy metrics and to focus on the high potential of urban environments through the implementation of a clear vision of circular smart cities;\n\n- within the framework of the Zero Pollution dossier and other environmental dossiers, the Enel Group is actively promoting the maximization of synergies between decarbonization and other environmental policies. In this context, synergies of climate and air quality policies are perhaps the most critical, and electricity technologies can play a key role in combating climate change, improving local air quality and increasing the circularity of the EU\u2019s economic system. The revision of the Air Quality Directive, proposed by the Commission in 2022, has proved crucial to strengthen the role that clean technologies can play in improving air quality for European citizens. Soil management is vital for a circular economy that aims to develop sustainable models capable of encouraging the coexistence of different activities and creating synergies and mutual benefits, such as agrivoltaics. The new soil strategy published in November 2022 is a step in the right direction. However, its scope should also be extended to the redevelopment of brownfield sites and the reuse of brownfields to avoid further land acquisition and soil pollution.\n\nIn the USA and Canada, the main dossiers on which the Enel Group has taken action with advocacy actions include:\n\n- the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), aimed at incentivizing the deployment and generation of clean energy technologies. The law is expected to provide new incentives for clean energy and facilitate a 40% reduction in the US economy\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Enel has supported the IRA, presenting its assessments to Congress and working with trade associations to inform and model the design elements of policies within the law;\n\n- the US Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), the impact of which has been particularly significant on imports from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in China. In June 2022, the provisions for major solar energy importers came into force. Enel has supported the sector\u2019s action to develop supply chain traceability programs and, with trade associations, has opposed any presence of forced labor in supply chains, in line with the public commitment made in this regard through the human rights policy;\n\n- in California, the mobilization of financing for distributed generation and resilience: funds have been allocated to support resources (generation and storage) distributed at low/zero emissions, but also for demand management on electricity grids. In addition, a commitment has been made to accelerate the electrification of transport. Enel has supported the allocation of these funds and met and provided its assessments to the legislature, working with trade associations;\n\n- the Massachusetts Climate Bill enacted in August 2022, which aims to promote a 50% reduction in emissions compared to 1990 by 2030. The law includes a target of developing energy storage of 1 GWh by 2025 and requires all new sales of passenger vehicles to be zero-emission by 2035. There are also discounts for the sale of electric vehicles and incremental incentives for low-income buyers. Enel has supported the legislation and has met and provided targeted evaluations to the legislature, working with trade associations;\n\n- the increase in the carbon price in Alberta, with a carbon price trajectory to 2026 aligned with the forecasts of the Canadian Federal Government. Starting January 1, 2023, the federal carbon price will increase from CAD 50 to 65 per ton of GHG emissions, with subsequent annual increases bringing the tax to CAD 170 per ton by 2030. Enel has supported the pricing trajectory and has met directly with government officials and representatives, working with trade associations.\nIn Latin America, the main dossiers on which the Enel Group has taken action with advocacy actions include:\n\n- in Peru, the Supreme Decree 003-2022-MINAM, which declares the climate emergency of national interest and provides for the actions to be taken by the various ministries, with the aim of reducing emissions to achieve the NDC objectives under the Paris Agreement. In this sense, the country has committed to accelerate the process of reducing emissions compared to the 2030 trend scenario to 30%, for the unconditional target of its NDC, to 40% in the case of a conditional target. It has also committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Enel has supported the strengthening of the Peruvian NDC (Nationally Determined Contribution), which will increase the development possibilities of renewable companies, and worked in 2022 on the Energy Transition Roadmap project in Peru together with the consulting firm Deloitte, as well as with public and private stakeholders;\n\n- in Colombia, the Climate Action Act, which aims to regulate the objectives of the NDC and some other aspects, such as greenhouse gas inventories for the country\u2019s industrial sector. Enel has also promoted the adoption of the law through a special project, Energy Transition Roadmap, implemented with the support of the consulting firm CREE and in collaboration with public and private stakeholders;\n\n- also in Colombia, Resolution 172, approved in 2022, establishing the Presidential Cabinet Intersectoral Commission on Climate Action. Enel has promoted the establishment of the Commission that will be tasked with verifying the country\u2019s progress and requirements regarding the implementation of measures aimed at respecting the international obligations acquired by the State in terms of climate action;\n\n- in Costa Rica in September 2022, the Ministry of Environment and Energy published the Regulation of Chapter III of Law No. 9518 on Incentives and Promotion of Electric Transport, which regulates the application of temporary tax incentives for electric vehicles, as well as a temporary exemption from property tax for electric vehicles. Enel supported the publication of the law and promoted it, including through the Energy Transition Roadmap project, carried out with the support of the consulting firm Deloitte and in collaboration with public and/or private stakeholders;\n\n- in Panama, the approval of Decree-Law No. 10, which adopts the National Climate Action Plan (PNAC). The Plan is seen as a crucial tool in promoting short- and long-term national and sectoral ambitions of climate policies, in order to facilitate and ensure the implementation of the NDC. Enel supported the promulgation of the Decree and promoted a collaboration network to support the dissemination and awareness of the results, providing the recommendations that emerged from the Energy Transition Roadmap project carried out in the country;\n\n- in Guatemala, the development of an NDC, which envisages reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 11.2% by 2030 compared to the baseline scenario, as a target not conditional on international support. In 2022, Enel also worked in Guatemala on an energy transition roadmap for the country with the aim of proposing scenarios that will enable it to comply with the commitments made in the NDC;\n\n- in Argentina, the decision to maintain the commitment made in the NDC 2020, ratifying the commitment to reduce emissions by 27.7% by 2030, compared to the first NDC presented in 2016. Also in this case, as in other countries, Enel has promoted advocacy actions with the development of the Energy Transition Roadmap project. Enel also promoted the adoption of Resolution no. 370 of 2022, which provides for a mechanism for the sale of electricity from renewable sources for distributors of the Wholesale Electricity Market (MEM) through the Renewable Energy Forward Market (MATER);\n\n- in Chile, Enel implemented advocacy activities in support of the adoption of Law no. 21,455. This piece of legislation aims to address the challenges of climate change in the country and establishes climate governance mechanisms, setting the goal of carbon neutrality to be achieved by 2050 at the latest. Enel\u2019s vision is aligned with the law. This is also the background to Enel\u2019s decision to exit coal-fired generation in the country, which ended in September 2022 with the closure of the Bocamina II plant;\n\n- again in Chile, in June 2022, the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism implemented Council Agreement No. 3121 of 2022, which creates the \u201cCommittee for the Development of the Green Hydrogen Industry\u201d and establishes the rules that will govern its operation. The Committee\u2019s objective will be to accelerate the sustainable development of this industry by supporting the national strategy for green hydrogen. Enel has actively participated with several key players in the development of green hydrogen in the country and, moreover, has contributed to the public debate with the Energy Transition Roadmap project together with the consulting firm energiE, in collaboration with public and private stakeholders;\nin Brazil, Enel promoted the publication of Decree No. 11,075. It defines the procedures for the Sectoral Plans for Climate Change Mitigation and creates the National Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction System (SINARE), in order to establish emission reduction targets for compliance with the national NDC. In addition, Resolution no. 6 of June 2022 of the National Energy Policy Council establishes the National Hydrogen Program (PNH2) and creates a Committee with the aim of coordinating and supervising the planning and implementation of the PNH2. Enel has also supported the strengthening of climate ambition envisaged by Brazil\u2019s second NDC update. This strengthening aims to increase emissions reductions by up to 50% by 2030 and achieve greenhouse gas neutrality by 2050. Enel has positively assessed these developments, which will increase the possibilities of development of renewable companies. It has supported legislative action with the Energy Transition Roadmap project carried out with the support of Deloitte and in collaboration with public and private stakeholders.\n\nOn the African continent, the main climate dossiers on which Enel has carried out advocacy activities are:\n\n- in South Africa, the Climate Change Act, which creates a regulatory framework that will enable an effective response to climate change and a long-term transition to a low-carbon economy. The provisions of this law are in line with the Enel Group\u2019s operational objectives for renewable development in South Africa;\n\n- in Morocco, Enel has promoted the adoption of a new law aimed at regulating the production of its own electricity, while guaranteeing the security of the national network and compliance with the principles of transparency and non-discrimination between the various market players. For the first time, the law also provides for the right of access to electricity storage services, as well as the right to sell the excess to the TSO.\n\nIn the Asia Pacific region, the main dossiers on which Enel\u2019s advocacy actions have focused are:\n\n- in South Korea, the opening of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) market. It enables renewable generators to sell electricity directly to end users. Enel sees this initiative as a significant step towards the development and use of renewable energy. In addition, the first auction program dedicated to onshore and offshore wind has been launched. Enel also supported this legislative initiative as auctions conducted in a transparent and structured manner are recognized as one of the best support mechanisms for the development of renewable energy;\n\n- also in South Korea, the 10th Basic Plan for Electricity Supply and Demand has been finalized. It envisages that the national generation mix to 2036 will be dominated by nuclear and renewables, with a gradually decreasing role for fossil fuels. Hydrogen and ammonia will be used in LNG and coal-fired power plants to reduce emissions. In this context, Enel has supported the development of renewable energy, but considers it inefficient to use hydrogen to produce electricity;\n\n- in Vietnam, Enel promoted the finalization of a new and more ambitious NDC and, in particular, the strengthening of the unconditional objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 15.8% by 2030 compared to a business-as-usual scenario of the reference year 2010. Subject to international support and financing, the 2030 reduction target has been raised to 43.5%. In this context, the country also reiterated its goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Enel supported this decision as it will accelerate the decarbonization of Vietnam by offering development opportunities for renewable sources and end-use electrification;\n\n- in Australia, the Enel Group supported the plans of the new Federal Labor Government, aimed at mobilizing new financing for the expansion of the transmission grid and the establishment of a program to attract greater investments in the renewable energy sector;\n\n- In India, ancillary services regulations have been adopted, establishing the introduction of Secondary Reserve Ancillary Services (SRAS) and Tertiary Reserve Ancillary Services (TRAS). The regulations allow all types of technology to provide SRAS and TRAS, including battery energy storage systems (BESS). Enel is in favor of these regulations and believes that they encourage the development of renewable sources and distributed storage;\n\n- India\u2019s Ministry of Energy has also issued the Green Energy Open Access Rules. The objective of this regulation is to increase the availability and use of renewable energy and to promote the growth of the sale of energy from renewable sources with open access. Enel welcomed the enactment of this regulation as it believes that it fosters new opportunities for the development of renewable sources.\nIn addition to the direct advocacy activities, Enel is actively contributing to the debate on how best to address the challenge of climate change through specific initiatives. In 2022, these included:\n\n- **the GSEP (Global Sustainable Electricity Partnership) Global Electrification Monitor**, aimed at illustrating the state of the art of decarbonization of energy end-uses through electrification. The initiative was launched during the annual GSEP CEO Summit held in 2022 in Marrakech. Through the use of specific indicators for the 15 countries analyzed, it highlights to what extent the penetration of electrification in end-uses is in line with the International Energy Agency\u2019s scenarios for achieving the objectives set by the Paris Agreement. Also in this context, GSEP hosted a High-Level Dialogue on electrification during New York Climate Week 2022. In this context, 14 companies have signed the Catalyzing Electrification agreement, to accelerate electrification of energy end-uses, aimed at reducing greenhouse gases;\n\n- **development and collaboration on several Energy Transition Roadmap projects**, to stimulate debate on how best to accelerate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, in Europe Enel collaborated with the Enel Foundation and Ambrosetti on the Energy Transition Roadmaps for Italy and Spain and supported Eurelectric in the work to define the new decarbonization roadmap for Europe. In Latin America, Enel has completed Energy Transition Roadmap projects in several countries, including Chile, Brazil, Peru, Panama and Costa Rica. In several cases, the results of these projects were presented and discussed in the context of COP 27 events;\n\n- **strengthening commitments to Sustainable Development Goal 7 through the Energy Compacts (EC) promoted by UN-Energy and SEforALL**. Compacts are voluntary commitments by companies, governments and other stakeholders to accelerate action for universal access to clean and affordable energy for all. In this context, the Group announced Enel Chile\u2019s new Energy Compact, promoted in collaboration with the Universidad del Desarrollo and the Government of the Santiago Metropolitan Region, which aims to electrify the entire bus fleet by 2030 and expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, both public and private;\n\n- **participation in a number of specific advocacy initiatives, through letters and appeals developed under ad hoc alliances**. For example, the Enel Group, together with over 150 business leaders, has signed an open letter by CLG Europe to the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, to invite the EU to strengthen energy security by accelerating the green transition through the REPowerEU plan. In addition, Enel has participated in lobbying activities in support of the 100 gCO\u2082/kWh threshold \u2013 published in the Delegated Acts of the European Taxonomy \u2013 which allows an activity to be defined as environmentally sustainable if its CO\u2082 emissions are below this threshold. Enel not only supports compliance with this threshold, but also asks to specify how this threshold should be reduced over time until it reaches zero by 2050. Finally, through the We Mean Business Coalition, the Group signed a declaration during COP 27, together with over 270 companies and civil society leaders, reaffirming its commitment to limit global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C, while ensuring a just transition and a fair and inclusive future for all, and calling on governments to maintain it as a goal during the negotiations.\nEnel\u2019s commitment to fight against climate change through associations and organizations\n\nThe Group plays an active role in various industry and multi-stakeholder associations and organizations with the aim of promoting issues concerning energy transition and the commitment to fight climate change at national and global level. Enel is committed to ensuring that the various industry associations, business networks and think tanks of which it is a member operate in full compliance with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the decarbonization roadmap established by the Group. Enel therefore systematically verifies the consistency of the associations\u2019 positions with the climate policies shared at the Group level. This verification process is carried out in two stages: (i) before joining the association, through an in-depth analysis of the body\u2019s by-laws, in line with the Climate Policy issued in September 2021; (ii) after joining the association, by actively contributing to its work and/or taking positions of responsibility within it or promoting the Enel Group\u2019s position within working groups.\n\nFinally, a review of the level of alignment of the associations with Enel\u2019s strategy is conducted annually. Where an association is found not to be in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and Enel\u2019s climate risk mitigation strategy, the Company assesses whether the misalignment could compromise the effectiveness of Enel\u2019s advocacy and participation, and may eventually decide to withdraw from the association.\n\nBy way of example, in recent years we have withdrawn our participation from some associations whose views on climate policies and how to achieve the energy transition were persistently different from Enel\u2019s in terms of fighting climate change and pursuing the goals set forth in the Paris Agreement. On the other hand, it may happen that in some associations, despite the existence of a misalignment, Enel decides to continue to be a member with the aim of influencing and aligning association decisions with its own vision of achieving the targets set by the Paris Agreement.\n\nBack in 2020, an initial selection of the main industrial associations and organizations was carried out to identify alignment with Enel\u2019s climate position, an activity that continued in 2021.\n\nIn 2022, the analysis for assessing alignment with the Paris Agreement was extended to cover all associations involved in climate advocacy activities, of which Enel is a global member. In addition, as in 2021, the list of the main associations most involved in climate advocacy activities with which Enel collaborates worldwide (https://www.enel.com/content/dam/enel-com/documenti/investitori/sostenibilita/2022/enel-engagement-associations-involved-climate-policy-advocacy.pdf) was also published for 2022, including the assessment, for each of them, of the alignment with the Paris Agreement. This alignment was carried out on the basis of a specific methodology using targeted evaluations on the science of climate change, climate policies at global and national level, disclosures on the topic, and technologies proposed.\n\nIn particular, in 2022, the Enel Group identified for each country and/or region of presence and/or interest the main associations involved in advocacy activities of climate policies and conducted, for each of them, a qualitative assessment in order to identify the association\u2019s level of alignment with the Paris Agreement. This assessment was carried out on the basis of six main dimensions:\n\ni. Climate Science \u2013 the extent to which the association involves itself in the issues related to climate change and in the results and evidence of the Reports published by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change);\n\nii. Climate Policy \u2013 the extent to which the association supports the UNFCCC process and other global policy initiatives;\n\niii. Carbon Pricing Climate Policies \u2013 the extent to which the association supports Carbon Pricing (Carbon Tax, Emissions Trading);\n\niv. Non Carbon Pricing Climate Policy \u2013 the extent to which the association supports other types of climate policies related to energy efficiency, renewable energy and GHG regulation;\n\nv. Communication \u2013 the extent to which the association communicates on climate issues;\n\nvi. Energy Transition & Zero Carbon Technologies \u2013 the extent to which the association supports innovative and effective technologies in the fight against climate change.\n\nThe methodology developed by Enel for assessing the alignment of associations to the Paris Agreement provides, in particular, that to each of the six dimensions listed above is assigned a level of alignment (high, medium or low). Then, a numerical score is given to each of the dimensions, which reflects the level of alignment assigned. The average of the scores of the six dimensions generates the final result of alignment of the association to the Paris Agreement, which can be: high, medium/high, medium, medium/low or low.\n\nIn general, Enel believes that the most effective approach when an association is not aligned with the Paris Agreement is to remain in such association with the aim of orienting and aligning its decisions with Enel\u2019s own vision of achieving the targets set by the Paris Agreement.

Specifically, with regard to:\n\n- **the long-term variable remuneration** of the Chief Executive Officer/General Manager and Key management personnel, for which a performance objective is set, including, since 2018, with regard to the reduction of \u201cScope 1\u201d greenhouse gas emissions by the Enel Group over the next three years (with a weighting of 10% of the total long-term variable remuneration), deemed suitable to adequately support the achievement of the climate change-related targets in the 2022-2024 Strategic Plan;\n\n- **variable short-term remuneration** (MBO), the targets can include those relating to the specific company Function of each manager. For example, they include objectives related to the introduction of innovative products and services into the business for managers within Holding Functions, the development of renewable energy for managers within the Enel Green Power and Thermal Generation Global Business Line or related to energy transition solutions within the Enel X Global Retail Business Line.\n\nFor further details, see \u201cThe Enel governance model for sustainability\u201d section of the 2022 Sustainability Report.\nClimate change and long-term scenarios\n\nThe Enel Group develops short, medium and long-term scenarios for macroeconomic, financial, energy and climate conditions in order to support its processes of planning, capital allocation, strategic positioning, and assessment of risks and resilience of the strategy. For this purpose, the analysis and benchmarking of external energy transition scenarios was also carried out, which, together with the analysis of relevant reports on macroeconomic and commodity trends was a key starting point for defining the assumptions of Enel\u2019s long-term energy scenarios.\n\nGlobal energy scenarios are typically classified by scenario families based on the level of climate ambition:\n\n- **Business as usual/Stated policies**: energy scenarios based on business as usual/current policies. They provide a conservative benchmark for the future, representing the evolution of the energy system in the absence of additional climate and energy policies. Currently, these scenarios do not achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement;\n\n- **Paris Aligned**: energy scenarios aligned with the Paris Agreement, i.e., that include a goal of limiting global average temperature increase to \u201cwell below 2 \u00b0C\u201d compared to pre-industrial levels. To achieve this goal, scenarios in this category consider new and more ambitious policies for decarbonization, end-use electrification, and the development of renewables;\n\n- **Paris Ambitious**: global energy scenarios that chart the path toward Net-Zero GHG emissions by 2050, in line with the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to stabilize the global average temperature rise at 1.5 \u00b0C, although with different ranges of probability.\n\nThis classification of scenario families was developed over the years and was further expanded in 2021 by collaborating with a working group coordinated by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), which Enel took part in. The aim of the project was to devise a common and transparent approach to using public scenarios for companies in the energy industry, helping them to use them in order to assess the risks and opportunities associated with climate change, in line with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The end result of this work is: (i) a report that provides context for the energy scenarios and describes the shared definition of the scenario families, as well as (ii) an online platform that gathers the variables of a variety of scenarios (WBCSD, 2023, Climate Scenario Analysis Reference Approach).\n\nEnel\u2019s long-term scenarios are based on an overall framework so as to ensure consistency between the energy transition scenario and the physical climate scenario:\n\n- the \u201cenergy transition scenario\u201d describes how the generation and consumption of energy evolves in various sectors in a specific economic, social, policy and regulatory context;\n\n- issues concerning future trends in climate variables (in terms of frequency and intensity of acute and chronic phenomena) define the so-called \u201cphysical scenario\u201d.\n\nIn order to assess the effects of transition and physical phenomena on the energy system, the Group relies on internal models that describe the energy system for each country under analysis, taking into consideration specific technological, social-economic, policy and regulatory aspects.\n\nIn 2022, with the aim of fostering global and local cross-functional collaboration to define both physical and energy transition scenarios, while ensuring consistent compliance with the requirements of the TCFD, two internal cross-functional communities dedicated to both physical and transition scenarios were established. These were primarily intended to discuss and define context and benchmark analyses and long-term scenario assumptions, to identify relevant impact categories, and to establish methods for assessing them so as to define strategic and industrial measures.\nThe adoption of these scenarios and their integration into corporate processes takes account of the guidelines of the TCFD and enables the assessment of the risks and opportunities associated with climate change. The process that translates the scenario phenomena into information that is useful for industrial and strategic decisions can be summarized in five steps:\n\n1. **Identification of trends and factors** relevant to the business (e.g., electrification of consumption, heat waves, etc.)\n2. Development of **link** functions connecting climate/transition scenarios and operating variables\n3. **Identification of risks and opportunities**\n4. **Calculation of impacts** on business (e.g., change in performance, losses, capex)\n5. **Strategic actions**: definition and implementation (e.g., capital allocation, resilience plans)\n\n### Energy transition scenarios\n\nThe energy transition scenarios detail how the generation and consumption of energy evolve in a certain geopolitical, macroeconomic, regulatory and competitive context, depending on the available technology options; they correlate with greenhouse gas emission trends and climate scenarios and, consequently, a specific temperature increase by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial values.\n\n**The main assumptions** considered when defining transition scenarios concern:\n\n- **local policies and regulatory measures to fight climate change**, increase energy security and promote sustainable development, such as measures for reducing carbon dioxide emissions and fossil fuel consumption, for increasing energy efficiency, for consumer electrification, and the amount of renewable electricity generated;\n- **the global macroeconomic and energy context** (for example, in terms of gross domestic product, population and commodity prices), also considering international benchmarks;\n- **the evolution of technologies for the generation**, conversion and consumption of energy, in terms of both technical operating parameters and costs.\n\nIn 2022, Enel updated its framework of medium to long-term energy transition scenarios, and defined scenario narratives based on three main scenario \u201csignposts\u201d, that is, the main drivers of uncertainty in relation to developments in the macroeconomic and energy sectors: achieving the Paris Agreement goals, the escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and tackling the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Group\u2019s **reference scenario for long-term planning, called the Paris scenario**, is therefore:\n\n- a Paris-aligned scenario, which involves achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, that is, a rise in the global average temperature below 2 \u00b0C compared to pre-industrial levels, and therefore anticipating a higher level of climate ambition than business as usual, but without necessarily assuming that the Net-Zero target will be reached by 2050, considering the current level of overall ambition at a global level;\n- a scenario in which the geopolitical tensions heightened by the Russia-Ukraine conflict are expected to have lasting effects, resulting in an acceleration in electrification and renewables, as well as in a greater use of LNG in order to raise the level of security of...\nsupplies in a changed environment, especially in Europe;\n\u2022 a scenario marked by the expectation that Covid will be contained or become endemic, with a high vaccination rate and no need for large-scale lockdowns.\n\nAs for the climate ambition in the reference scenario, it is assumed that consumer electrification will continue to increase and that renewables will be further developed, partly due to the energy security policies adopted (such as REPowerEU in the EU and the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States). In this scenario, globally speaking, governments, companies, organizations and citizens effectively participate in the collective effort to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWith respect to the possibility of assuming the achievement of the most challenging objective of the Paris Agreement as a benchmark scenario for long-term planning, i.e. to stabilize the average global temperature within +1.5 \u00b0C, some uncertainty clearly remains as to whether certain countries could maintain inertial trajectories, delaying the decarbonization process that will lead to net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nAssumptions concerning commodity price trends as inputs to the Paris scenario are consistent with external scenarios that achieve Paris Agreement goals. In particular, a sustained increase in the price of CO\u2082, caused by the gradual reduction of permit supply in the face of growing demand, and a sharp fall in coal prices, due to decreasing demand, are expected by 2030. With regard to gas, it is believed that price tensions will ease in the coming years in light of a realignment between supply and demand at a global level. Finally, oil prices are expected to stabilize gradually, for which we estimate peak demand around 2030.\nAlternative scenarios to the reference scenario were defined depending on the degree of climate ambition at global and local level: a \u201cSlower Transition\u201d scenario, marked by a slower speed of transition, and an \u201cAccelerated Transition\u201d scenario, marked by an increase in ambition compared to the reference scenario, specifically with respect to some of the characteristic variables of energy transition, such as the rate of electrification of final energy consumption, green hydrogen penetration or end users\u2019 attitudes towards more sustainable consumption patterns (e.g. modal shift with regard to public/private means of transport). These scenarios are used for sensitivity analysis in the evaluation of investments, strategic stress tests, risk assessment, and to identify business opportunities.\nLocal transition scenarios\n\nEnel\u2019s reference scenario \u2013 the Paris scenario \u2013 covers all the countries and regions in which the Group operates, and therefore entails a climate ambition that is in line with the achievement of the Paris Agreement goals, supported by greater electrification of final energy consumption and the development of renewable capacity. Local scenarios were broken down based on two complementary approaches:\n\n- a bottom-up approach was taken in the main countries where the Group operates by using fundamental models to simulate the long-term balance of the entire energy system, explicitly demanding that the country as a whole limit its CO\u2082 emissions. The promotion of scenario variables that are relevant to the Group\u2019s activities (including electricity demand, rate of electrification, renewable capacity and distributed generation capacity, the number of electric vehicles and green hydrogen generation) is thus established using dedicated models with a time horizon up to 2050, with the aim of minimizing costs for the system by limiting CO\u2082 emissions;\n- for the other countries of interest, the main variables of each scenario were established by conducting statistical analyses of internal and consensus data, compared with external scenarios that are in line with the Paris Agreement goals, which were made available by accredited national and international bodies and providers.\n\nInternal transition scenarios were defined due to the need for increased modeling flexibility and increased geographical and operational granularity for the main variables that affect Enel\u2019s various businesses compared to the scenarios provided by the main external providers. The latter are typically outlined and made public on a global or regional level, with a few exceptions for larger countries, which only rarely coincide with the countries in which the Group operates or has an interest in.\n\nEurope, focus on Italy and Spain\n\nIn the Paris scenario, emissions in European countries are decreasing in line with the European \u201cFit for 55\u201d package, as a result of increased electrification of final energy consumption, driven by an increased use of renewables in the electricity generation mix.\n\nItaly\n\nIn Italy, according to the Paris scenario, which is more ambitious than the existing national plan (Integrated Energy and Climate Plan, 2020), electrification is set to increase to 30% by 2030 (from 22% in 2021), with a level of renewable generation sufficient to meet over 70% of electricity demand (instead of around 55% as envisaged in the national plan).\n\nThe Slower Transition scenario is based on the assumption that Italy will remain firmly committed to the existing Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan as regards the ambition to reduce emissions, which is a less optimistic macroeconomic scenario than the Paris scenario, particularly in the initial years, with increased pressure when it comes to the price and supply of fossil fuels and raw materials.\n\nThe Accelerated Transition scenario has the same ambition of the Paris scenario when it comes to decarbonization. This scenario assumes that authorization processes for renewable energy generation plants will be revised more effectively, resulting in a slight increase in the number of installations, with the costs of technologies for green hydrogen generation falling more rapidly and its subsequent increased penetration in hard-to-abate sectors, at the expense of blue and gray hydrogen (hydrogen produced from gas, respectively with and without the use of CCS technologies). Moreover, the fact that people are becoming more concerned about climate change promotes more \u201cclimate-aware\u201d behavior such as a modal shift in the transport sector (with a greater use of low-emission transport \u2013 for example, public transport).\n\nSpain\n\nIn the case of Spain, the level of ambition established in the national plan is in line with the achievement of the Paris Agreement goals; in light of this, the Paris scenario foresees that the electrification rate in 2030 will be of 32% (compared to 24% in 2021) and that the development of renewable capacity will be such that the share of electricity demand met through renewable generation will increase to over 80% (compared to 53% in 2021). The alternative Slower Transition scenario, instead, assumes that there will be a delay in implementing policies for greater penetration of renewables and electric technologies, especially in the case of private cars. The Accelerated Transition scenario has the same ambition of the Paris scenario and envisages that authorization processes for renewables will be quicker. This scenario also assumes that there will be a higher incentive for the electrification of buildings and the complete adoption of the national green hydrogen strategy, which will make it possible to accelerate the construction of renewable energy generation plants coupled with electrolyzers by 2030.\n\nLatin America, focus on Brazil and Chile\n\nBrazil\n\nIn the case of Brazil, according to the Paris scenario, which is more ambitious than the existing national plan (Plano Decenal de Expans\u00e3o de Energia 2031, 2022) when it comes to reducing emissions, electrification is set to increase to 25% by 2030 (from 22% in 2021), with a level of renewable\ngeneration sufficient to meet over 88% of electricity demand (instead of around 82% as envisaged in the national plan).\n\nThe Slower Transition scenario is based on the assumption of following the increasing emission trend of the existing national plan (Plano Decenal de Expans\u00e3o de Energia 2031), with fewer hydroelectric plants being expanded in favor of new thermal (gas) capacity and a less optimistic macro-economic scenario than the Paris scenario, particularly in the initial years.\n\nThe Accelerated Transition scenario increases the ambition of the Paris scenario when it comes to decarbonization, assuming that the regulatory framework for building offshore wind plants will be more quickly defined, resulting in increased exploitation of the potential of this technology, greater penetration of distributed solar generation, and further development of technologies for green hydrogen generation.\n\nChile\n\nIn the case of Chile, the Paris scenario is developed in line with the Net-Zero scenario set out in the government document PELP (Planificaci\u00f3n Energ\u00e9tica a Largo Plazo) with regard to reducing emissions, and includes ambitious targets for the generation and export of green hydrogen. As in the government scenario, it involves shutting down all coal-fired power plants by 2035, increasing taxes on CO\u2082 emissions and achieving high levels of electrification in transport by banning sales of conventional vehicles by 2040 and committing to full electrification of city bus fleets from 2040 onwards.\n\nThe Slower Transition scenario is marked by a slower energy transition, centered on implementing existing measures and policies that are less ambitious than the ones included in the Paris scenario.\n\nThe Accelerated Transition scenario reaches net zero emissions by 2050 and, compared to the Paris scenario, foresees an acceleration of the electrification process in all economic sectors, including transport. It also brings forward to 2035 the ban on conventional vehicle sales, a more ambitious target for green hydrogen exports, 100% of the electricity generation mix met by renewable sources by 2050, the phase-out of coal by 2030, and an additional increase in taxes on CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nThe physical climate scenario\n\nWithin the aforementioned framework, each scenario narrative was developed in such a way as to ensure consistency between the energy transition scenarios and the climate scenarios.\n\nClimate change is playing an increasingly prominent role in these scenarios, with impacts not only on the transition of the economy towards Net-Zero emissions, but also physical impacts that can be divided into:\n\n- **Acute phenomena**, that is, short-term but rather intense phenomena, such as floods, hurricanes, etc., with potential impacts on assets (such as damage and business interruptions);\n- **Chronic phenomena** related to structural changes in the climate, such as the rising trend in temperatures, rising sea levels etc., which can cause, for example, constant changes in the output of generation plants and in electricity consumption profiles in the residential and commercial sectors.\n\nSuch phenomena are analyzed by looking at how they will behave in the future: this is done by selecting the best available data from the output data of climate models at various levels of resolution, as well as historical data.\n\nAmong the climatic projections developed by the \u201cInter-governmental Panel on Climate Change\u201d (IPCC) on a global scale, the Group has chosen three that are in line with those taken into account in the latest IPCC report as part of the sixth assessment cycle (AR6). Such scenarios are associated with emission patterns that are linked to a level of the so-called Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP), each one being related to one of five social and economic scenarios that the scientific community defines as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP):\n\n- **SSP1-RCP 2.6**: compatible with a global warming range below 2 \u00b0C, compared with pre-industrial levels (1850-1900), by 2100 (the IPCC projects approximately +1.8 \u00b0C on average over the 1850-1900 period); the Group associates the SSP1-RCP 2.6 scenario with the Paris and Accelerated Transition scenarios in analyses that take into account both physical variables and transition variables;\n- **SSP2-RCP 4.5**: compatible with an intermediate scenario, in which an average temperature increase of around 2.7 \u00b0C is expected by 2100 when compared with the 1850-1900 period. The RCP 4.5 scenario best represents the current global climate and political context and the associated transition assumptions. This scenario projects global warming as being consistent with the estimated temperature increase that takes into account current global policies; the Group associates the SSP2-\nRCP 4.5 scenario with the Slower Transition scenario in analyses that take into account both physical variables and transition variables;\n\n- **SSP5-RCP 8.5**: compatible with a scenario where no particular measures are taken to combat climate change. According to this scenario, the global temperature is estimated to increase by around +4.4 \u00b0C, compared to pre-industrial levels, by 2100.\n\nThe Group sees the RCP 8.5 scenario as a worst-case climate scenario, which is used for assessing the effects of physical phenomena in a context in which climate change is particularly severe, but is not considered likely at present. The RCP 2.6 scenario is used for the assessment of physical phenomena and for analyses that consider an energy transition that is in line with the most ambitious mitigation targets.\n\nThe analyses performed on the physical scenarios considered both chronic phenomena and acute phenomena. In describing specific complex events of interest, the Group looks at data and analyses conducted by both private entities and public and academic institutions.\n\nClimate scenarios are global in nature. Accordingly, in order to determine the effects in the areas of relevance for the Group, they must be analyzed locally. The Group\u2019s active partnerships include an ongoing collaboration with the Department of Geosciences of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste. As part of this collaboration, the ICTP provides projections for the main climate variables with a grid resolution that varies from approximately 12 km to approximately 100 km on the side and a time horizon of 2020-2050. The main variables are temperature, rainfall and snowfall, and solar radiation. With respect to previous analysis carried out, the current studies are based on the use of multiple regional climate models: the one developed by ICTP combined with five other simulations, selected as representative of the ensemble of climate models currently available in the literature. The output of the ensemble represents all the different climate models, which are averaged together. This technique is usually adopted in the scientific community to obtain a more robust, bias-free analysis mediated by the various assumptions that could characterize the single model.\n\nFor certain specific climate variables, such as gusts of wind, the Group also relies on other providers specializing in the topic.\n\nIn this phase of the study, the future projections were analyzed for Italy, Spain and all countries of interest to the Group in South America, Central America and North America, obtaining, also due to the use of the ensemble of models, a more definite representation of the physical scenario. In addition, similarly, the Group is also analyzing climate projection data for Africa, South Asia and South-East Asia, so as to cover all the main countries and regions where the Group operates globally.\n\nThe ICTP also offers scientific support when it comes to interpreting any other acquired climate data. Climate scenarios are always used for the countries that the Group is interested in, so that climate risk can be uniformly assessed.\n\nSome of these phenomena involve high levels of complexity, as they do not only depend on climatic trends but also on the specific characteristics of the territory, and require an additional modelling activity for their high-resolution representation. For this reason, in addition to the climate scenarios provided by ICTP, the Group also uses Natural Hazard maps, which make it possible to obtain, with a high spatial resolution, the return times of a series of events such as storms, hurricanes and floods. The use of these maps, as described in the section \u201cRisks and opportunities connected with climate change\u201d, is widely consolidated in the Group, which already uses this data based on a historical perspective to optimize insurance strategies. Furthermore, work is underway in order to be able to use this information also when processed in compliance with the projections of the climate scenarios.\nIntegration of climate scenarios into the Open Country Risk model\n\nEnel has adopted a quantitative Open Country Risk assessment model that can accurately monitor the level of risk of countries within its scope, which includes four elements of risk:\n\n- **economic factors**: measuring the economic resilience of each country, which is defined as a balanced position with respect to the external environment, effectiveness of domestic policies, banking and corporate system vulnerability, attractiveness in terms of economic growth and, ultimately, a quantification of extreme climate events as a source of environmental and economic stress;\n- **institutional and political factors**: assessing the soundness of institutions and of the political context;\n- **social factors**: a detailed analysis of social phenomena and of human rights aimed at measuring the degree of well-being, inclusion and social progress;\n- **energy factors**: measuring the effectiveness of the energy system and how it fits into the energy transition and into the fight against climate change, which are crucial factors for assessing the sustainability of investments over a medium to long-term period.\n\nTherefore, this work has made it possible to also integrate climate change aspects into the Open Country Risk model. More specifically, by introducing extreme weather events into the Open Country Risk, the evolution of several climate hazards can be assessed, both in the country and on a global scale, in a uniform manner. In particular, a modular approach was adopted that will enable analyses to be progressively improved by including new physical phenomena and fine-tuning methodologies and reference data. At present, it includes four climate phenomena: two are related to extreme temperatures, one to heavy rainfall and another to drought. In addition, the possibility of introducing other phenomena such as extreme wind and rising sea levels is being looked into. Phenomena are described with a numerical index, developed by taking into consideration global distribution, with a resolution of approximately 100 km x 100 km and summarized in a composite index.\nItaly\n\n**Acute phenomena**: a number of acute phenomena in Italy were analyzed, such as fire risk, extreme rainfall and heat waves. The first two phenomena were described using standard metrics, which are extensively used in the literature. With regard to heat waves, custom metrics were also defined for Enel Grids, in addition to the standard metrics, which were identified by comparing extreme phenomena that occurred in the past and that could potentially damage underground grids. The results in the RCP 2.6 scenario are shown in the figure. Therefore, the average number of days with heat waves in a year is likely to increase compared to the past, and will be more intense in areas currently affected by this phenomenon. Moreover, the situation is worse in the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.\n\nExtreme rainfall was studied by calculating the variation of daily rainfall above the 95th percentile, calculated as average annual millimeters in the periods of reference. A general increase in extreme rainfall can be observed in the period 2030-2050 in all analyzed scenarios. However, this is accompanied by a slight decrease in the annual sum of daily precipitation, if we exclude acute rainfall. In addition, this increase is more pronounced in Northeast Italy and along the Tyrrhenian coast.\n\nAs already shown in the analyses previously published by the Group, fire risk will also undergo important variations, which increase in the various climate scenarios considered. In particular, fire risk is described through the Fire Weather Index (FWI), a widely used indicator at international level that takes into account temperature, humidity, rain and wind in order to estimate a fire risk index. The data provided by the FWI can be useful in characterizing fire risk trends to support the business in managing it properly. The studies conducted, which examine the change in projections to 2030-2050 compared to 1990-2020, show that in all scenarios there is an increase in the number of high-risk days (index value > 45) in the summer season. This change mainly affects the islands and the southern regions of the country, where the increase in extreme risk days ranges from about +6 to +8 days compared to the historical period.\n\n**Chronic phenomena**: chronic changes in temperature can be analyzed to obtain information on the potential effects on cooling and heating demand in local energy systems. Similar to what was done in 2020, Heating Degree Days (HDD) were used to measure heating requirements, that is\n\n---\n\n(4) The number of average days per year for each province were calculated, under the following conditions: at least five days in a row with a minimum temperature above the 95th percentile of the historical distribution (1990-2020) and at least 18 \u00b0C. In addition, these five days must be characterized by the absence of rain, and at least one day must have a maximum temperature above the 95th percentile of the historical distribution (1990-2020). This metric was calculated by considering the entire country at the original resolution of the climate data (approximately 12 km x 12 km). Therefore, the high-resolution data were aggregated according to each province, considering as a single heat wave the phenomenon occurring at the same time on several pixels within the same province, and considering as duration the maximum width by combining the various pixels.\nthe sum, extended to all days of the year with $T_{\\text{average}} < 15 \\, ^\\circ\\text{C}$, of the differences between the indoor temperature ($T_{\\text{indoor}}$ assumed as 18 \u00b0C) and the average temperature, and the Cooling Degree Days (CDD), which is the sum, extended to all days of the year with $T_{\\text{average}} \\geq 24 \\, ^\\circ\\text{C}$, of the differences between the $T_{\\text{average}}$ and $T_{\\text{indoor}}$ (assumed as 21 \u00b0C), respectively for heating and cooling requirements. Average country data were averaged over the nation, weighting each geographic node by population through the use of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways associated with each RCP scenario. The figure shows the CDDs, which were calculated across Italy at high resolution for the historical period, and the expected average variation in the RCP 2.6 scenario. It also shows how the distribution of population is used as a basis for calculation at a national level. Generally speaking, an increase in CDDs is observed in the period 2030-2050, which are consistently higher than over the historical period, with an increasing trend in the various scenarios RCP 2.6 (+~45%), RCP 4.5 (+~80%) and RCP 8.5 (+~110%). On the other hand, a reduction in heating demand is observed, which is -8% in the RCP 2.6 scenario, -12% in RCP 4.5 and -16% in RCP 8.5 compared to the 2000-2020 period.\n\nWith regard to total rainfall, variations in this phenomenon in the basins of interest for the Group\u2019s hydroelectric generation were analyzed. Based on this analysis, in which the period 2030-2050 was compared with the period 1990-2020, no significant changes emerge, with a general trend of slight decrease in Central and Southern Italy in the RCP 2.6 scenario.\n\n---\n\n(5) Please note that the population density varies in the various SSPs, while population distribution across the country is much the same.\nSpain\n\n**Acute phenomena:** for Spain, the acute rainfall phenomenon was analyzed first, calculated as average annual millimeters in the periods of reference. As shown in the following figure, in which the 2030-2050 period is compared with the historical period 1990-2020, this acute event will be subject to variations throughout most of Spain as early as in the RCP 2.6 scenario. In particular, heavy rainfall will increase in the north, whereas in the southeast it is expected to decrease. The other scenarios show that there will be a decrease in heavy rainfall in the southern part of the country (in RCP 8.5 this reduction also affects the north-west).\n\nWith regard to fire risk, the area of Spain that will see the biggest increase, when compared to the historical period, in the number of days per year with Fire Weather Index greater than 45 (i.e. extreme risk) is the center-south, in all future scenarios. This increase is greater in worst-case scenarios (RCP 8.5) than in the RCP 2.6 scenario.\n\nHeat waves, as already highlighted in the analyses published previously by the Group, will be more geographically widespread and more frequent in the period 2030-2050, especially in the southern part of the country.\n\n**Chronic phenomena:** analysis of potential cooling and heating demand has been refined and updated in a similar way to that for Italy. In terms of Heating Degree Days and Cooling Degree Days, compared to the period 1990-2020, HDDs are estimated to decrease in all scenarios in the period 2030-2050, from around -10% in RCP 2.6 to -20% in RCP 8.5, and RCP 4.5 in the middle. The data also confirm an increase in CDDs (+34%) in the RCP 2.6 scenario and a change of +61% and +87% in the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively.\n\n---\n\n(6) Extreme rainfall is the sum of daily rainfall above the 95th percentile of the historical distribution in a specific period.\nCooling degree days (CDD) in the historical period (1990-2020) and expected change in the RCP 2.6 scenario. The distribution of population (1990-2020) on the same grid as the climate models is shown on the right, whereby the most densely populated areas that have the biggest impact on the calculation of the country-level metric are clearly visible.\n\nWith regard to total rainfall, variations in this phenomenon in the basins of interest for the Group\u2019s hydroelectric generation were analyzed. Based on this analysis, the data do not show appreciable variations when comparing the RCP 2.6 scenario (2030-2050) and the historical period (1990-2020), with a general trend of slight decrease.\n\n**Latin America**\n\n**Acute phenomena:** the fire risk, measured as the number of days per year with a FWI greater than 45 (extreme risk), differs from one area to another. As the figure on the left shows, when comparing the RCP 2.6 scenario (2030-2050) with the historical period (1990-2020), there is an increased number of days at high risk of fires in most parts of Brazil and in the Atacama Desert. In the rest of South America, it stays the same or decreases a little. Interestingly, the risk of fire is particularly high in areas with the lowest current Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values (as shown in the figure on the right(7)), that is, in areas with sparse vegetation. Some areas of the Amazon, in the heart of Brazil, are an exception, as they show not only a sharp increase in the number of days at risk of extreme fire, but also high vegetation coverage. It is essential to combine the fire risk index and vegetation, since the latter can potentially fuel fires and increase the likelihood of fire spreading.\n\n---\n\n(7) The map in the figure on the right shows processed NASA data on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from June 2021 to June 2022. The NDVI quantifies vegetation by measuring the difference between near-infrared light (which is strongly reflected by vegetation) and red light (which is absorbed by vegetation). This is a good indicator of vegetation growth and density. The higher the NDVI, the denser and healthier the vegetation.\nThe \u201cWarm Spell Duration Index\u201d (WSDI) is a standard indicator that can be used to evaluate extreme temperatures. Comparing the period 2030-2050 with the period 1990-2020, the data show a significant increase in days characterized by heat waves already in the RCP 2.6 scenario, especially in some areas of Brazil, Colombia, Peru and northern Chile. This increase in extreme temperatures will be even more pronounced in worst-case scenarios (RCP 8.5).\n\nFor extreme precipitation, daily rainfall above the 95th percentile was considered, similar to what was done for Italy and Spain. Future changes for this phenomenon are less homogeneous. For some areas, such as northern Brazil and northern Argentina, decreases compared to the historical reference period are expected in the RCP 2.6 scenario. On the other hand, in other areas, such as western Colombia and parts of Brazil and Peru, heavy rainfall increases are expected.\n\n**Chronic phenomena**: a study was carried out on potential changes in heating and cooling demand related to chronic changes in temperature. Again, changes in Heating Degree Days and Cooling Degree Days over the period 2030-2050, compared to the period 1990-2020, were calculated from data from 6 models, with a resolution of 25 km x 25 km. Average country data were averaged over the nation, weighting each geographic node by population through the use of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) associated with each RCP scenario. In each country studied, CDDs increase progressively in all scenarios: in the RCP 2.6 scenario they increase by 35% in Chile, while the increase is between 13% and 18% in the other countries examined. In the RCP 4.5 scenario, this increase becomes 113% for Chile and slightly more than 25% for Argentina, Brazil and Peru, while it stands at 18% for Colombia. The increase in CDDs with respect to the historical period is even more marked in the RCP 8.5 scenario. With regard to HDDs, in the RCP 2.6 scenario considerable reductions are estimated in Colombia (~52%), Brazil (~21%) and Peru (~14%), as well as a slight decrease in Chile (~5%). This trend intensifies in the RCP 4.5 scenario: ~62% in Colombia, ~27% in Brazil, ~20% in Peru and ~8% in Chile.\n\n---\n\n(8) The WSDI considers heat waves characterized by at least 6 consecutive days with a maximum daily temperature above the 90th percentile of the historical distribution.\n\n(9) In Chile, the percentage increase is higher than in the other LATAM countries, since the absolute values of CDD are very low. In fact, historically, CDDs are very close to zero throughout most of the country, with a few degrees Celsius annually only in the central part of the country.\nCooling degree days (CDD) in the historical period (1990-2020) and expected change in the RCP 2.6 scenario. The distribution of population (1990-2020) on the same grid as the climate models is shown on the right, whereby the most densely populated areas that have the biggest impact on the calculation of the country-level metric are clearly visible.\n\nWith regard to total rainfall, variations in the basins of interest for the Group\u2019s hydroelectric generation were analyzed. Analyses comparing 2030-2050 projections in the three scenarios to the historical period 1990-2009 show a trend of rainfall reductions in Argentina and Colombia. A slight increase or decrease in total rainfall is expected for the RCP 2.6 scenario in Brazil, based on the group of basins in question. In contrast, in Peru, rainfall will basically stay the same in the RCP 2.6 scenario. Ultimately, in Chile, as in Argentina and Colombia, total rainfall is expected to decrease in the lowest-emission scenario, but this decrease may have already taken place over the last few years (as it is already decreasing compared to historical levels).\n\n**North and Central America**\n\n**Acute phenomena:** first of all, the variation of frost days, that is, the average number of frost days per year, was analyzed for North America and Central America in several future scenarios (2030-2050) compared to the historical period (1990-2020). As shown in the maps in the following figure, the number of frost days will decrease mainly in the western part of the macro-region, with major variations in terms of magnitude in worst-case RCP scenarios. It is important to stress the fact that the decrease in frequency does not mean that the intensity of this acute phenomenon has increased, which is a topic that the Group is currently looking into.\n\n---\n\n(10) For the sake of accuracy, frost days are the number of days per year when the minimum temperature Tmin is lower than 0 \u00b0C.\nVariation in the average number of frost days per year between the various RCP scenarios (2030-2050) and the model history (1990-2020).\n\nWith regard to heat waves, as in the case of South America, the WSDI was studied. When comparing the 2030-2050 period with the historical period 1990-2020, we can expect a significant increase in the number of days characterized by heat waves as early as the RCP 2.6 scenario, especially in Central America and along the west coast of North America. This increase in the WSDI will be even more pronounced in the RCP 8.5 scenario.\n\nThe number of days in a year with a high fire risk, namely with a FWI greater than 45, is basically the same across most of the macro-region in the RCP 2.6 scenario (2030-2050) compared to the historical period (1990-2020). In the western part of the US and Mexico, instead, the number of high-risk days is expected to increase, becoming increasingly higher in the worst-case scenario.\n\nFurthermore, acute precipitation is expected to increase in nearly all of North America in the RCP 2.6 scenario compared to the historical period. It is important to highlight the fact that the magnitude of such increases varies from one area to another. Also in the RCP 2.6 scenario, in Central America, heavy rainfall will decrease in the central part of the region. In other areas it will remain the same or will slightly increase.\n\nChronic phenomena: as shown in the figure below, the average annual temperature increases in all future scenarios (2030-2050) compared to the historical period (1990-2020). On the whole, the increases are greater in the RCP 8.5 scenario than in the RCP 2.6 one. In all RCP scenarios, the regions that will get warmer are the ones located in the far north.\n\nBy comparing the various RCP scenarios (2030-2050) and the model history (1990-2020), the expected total annual rainfall tends to decrease in Central America, while in North America it will remain the same or will increase depending on the area.\n\nFor further information, please read the 2022 Integrated Annual Report.\nThe strategy to tackle climate change\n\nEnel\u2019s efforts to fight against climate change are one of the key pillars of the Group\u2019s strategy in the short and long term. On the one hand, Enel plays its part in driving the global energy transition towards a zero-emission model as a mitigation lever and, on the other hand, by setting up the best adaptation measures in order to adapt to changes that will eventually take place, in greater or lesser frequency and intensity.\n\nMitigation includes all initiatives intended to minimize the direct and indirect impact of the Group\u2019s activities on climate change, that is, first and foremost, all measures taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAdaptation, instead, includes all the initiatives that Enel intends to implement so as to make its assets more resilient, increase its capacity to react to extreme climatic events, and come up with strategic options and business models that will address various needs as the climate changes.\n\nIn each of these two areas, there are challenges but also opportunities that the Group is aiming to seize through its strategy. According to Enel\u2019s vision, adapting to climate change also entails exploring new business opportunities associated with the changed environment, developing new technologies and creating value from acquired skills.\n\nThe impact of climate change can also be mitigated by researching breakthrough technologies that allow for a greener economy by design or which, for example, simply improve performance and circularity.\n\nMedium and long-term strategy\n\nThe Group\u2019s decarbonization strategy, combined with its drive toward electrification, once again reaffirms its commitment to achieving zero emissions by 2040. In this respect, goals have also been set with regard to both direct and indirect emissions throughout the Group\u2019s value chain. Specifically, the strategy is based on:\n\n- **the decarbonization of the generation mix**, by progressively developing renewable energy while ceasing to produce electricity from thermal power sources;\n- **the electrification of final energy consumption**, by promoting new products and services for customers while gradually exiting the business of gas sales to end consumers (to be completed by 2040);\n- **the digitalization and upgrade of distribution network**, so as to tackle the ongoing energy transition and ensure service quality for customers.\nEnergy mix decarbonization:\n\nEnel expects to reach about 85% of its installed capacity from renewable sources by 2030, compared to around 65% in 2022, also considering the managed and not consolidated capacity (63.3%, considering only the consolidated capacity). In addition, it promotes a gradual reduction in the share of thermoelectric capacity in its energy mix, aiming to phase out coal-fired generation by 2027 and gas by 2040, thus achieving a 100% renewable, zero-emission energy mix by 2040.\n\nElectrification:\n\nElectric mobility is one of the top priorities in the field of electrification. Expanding the electric vehicle charging infrastructure is one of the prerequisites for achieving widespread use of electric cars and is therefore absolutely essential for the transition to zero-emission mobility. Enel X Way shares the same goal and is currently expanding its charging network even further, with the aim of having more than 4 million charging points by 2030. Another key aspect is the electrification of residential consumption, which Enel will be encouraging by promoting heat pumps for domestic heating and induction cooktops in kitchens, resulting in an increased electrification rate of Enel\u2019s customers from 17% today to around 20% in 2025 and 30% in 2030. This will allow them to reduce their total energy expenditure by 5% by 2025 and by around 20% by 2030, as well as their carbon footprint by 2030 as a result of a reduction in gas sales from approximately 10 bcm today to around 3 bcm in 2030, and then down to zero in 2040.\n\nDistribution grids:\n\nMoreover, Enel will support electrification also by investing in infrastructure, since grids are the key enablers of the energy transition. Out of the total amount to be invested in grids over the next few years, an increasingly large portion will be spent on expanding the number of connections with new users and on increasing the flexibility and capacity of the grid so that it can handle a growing share of distributed generation. Smart grids, clean energy, and energy efficiency are accessible to Enel customers through new features in each smart meter. The Group has already installed 46 million electronic meters to date and expects to reach 80 million units by 2030.\n\nShort-term strategy \u2013 Investment Plan 2023\u20132025\n\nThe Group\u2019s investments in 2023\u20132025, totaling approximately 37 billion euros, will be primarily aimed at promoting an integrated industrial supply chain to achieve sustainable electrification, which is becoming more and more necessary in global energy systems. This will involve supplying around 90% of fixed-price sales in \u201ccore\u201d countries (Italy, Spain, the United States, Chile, Brazil and Colombia) with carbon-free electricity in 2025 (compared to 70% in 2022), increasing generation from renewable sources to about 75% of the total, as well as achieving a digitalization rate of grid customers of around 80%. Specifically:\n\n- The Group intends to add around 21 GW of installed renewable capacity (of which around 19 GW in \u201ccore\u201d countries) by 2025, so it is well on track to meet its decarbonization targets, in line with the Paris Agreement. The Group intends to develop this renewable capacity through a market-leading pipeline of around 455 GW. Ultimately, the Group is planning to reduce installed thermoelectric capacity by 42% in 2025 (16 GW) compared to 2022 values (27.7 GW).\n\n- As for end customers, it plans to accelerate the provision of value-added services and the implementation of a state-of-the-art infrastructure over the next three years, in particular:\n  - charging points for electric vehicles (from approximately 0.3 million in 2022 to approximately 1.4 million in 2025);\n  - behind-the-meter storage systems (from around 75 MW in 2022 to around 352 MW in 2025);\n  - demand response (from around 8.5 GW estimated in 2022 to around 12.4 GW in 2025).\n\n- As for the grids, the Group is planning to invest approximately 15 billion euros in the 2023\u20132025 period, mostly in Europe (more than 80% of investments), since the Group now has a more geographically balanced presence and the regulatory frameworks are favorable, so as to promote the role of grids as enablers of the energy transition and as a driving force in the fight against climate change.\n\nBy adopting the Stewardship business model, Enel will also be mobilizing Group and third-party investments worth a total of approximately 15 billion euros. Such resources are instrumental in adding new generation from renewable sources, as well as a new infrastructure and services to accelerate the electrification process for the Group\u2019s customers.\nAround 94% of the Group\u2019s total investments in 2023-2025 are in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (\u201cSDGs\u201d), directly pursuing SDGs 7 (\u201cAffordable and clean energy\u201d), 9 (\u201cIndustry, innovation and infrastructure\u201d) and 11 (\u201cSustainable cities and communities\u201d), all of which are functional to SDG 13 (\u201cClimate action\u201d). The investments envisaged in the Group\u2019s Strategic Plan are in line with the decarbonization and greenhouse gas reduction targets, based on a specific methodology whereby investments made in renewables and retail power inherently fall under SDG 7, investments in the distribution network fall under SDG 9, and investments in Enel X are related to SDG 11. Therefore, the 94% referred to above does not include investments in conventional generation (including investments in maintenance) and in retail gas.\n\nIn addition, over 80% of the Group\u2019s investments in the 2023-2025 period will be aligned with the EU Taxonomy criteria due to their substantial contribution to climate change mitigation.\nRisks and opportunities connected with climate change\n\nThe process for defining the Group\u2019s strategy is accompanied by a careful analysis of the risks and opportunities connected to it, also including the aspects related to climate change. Every year, before the Board of Directors examines the Strategic Plan, the Control and Risk Committee is presented with a quantitative analysis of the risks and opportunities related to the Group\u2019s strategic positioning, which includes aspects related to the climate, such as regulatory factors and weather and climate phenomena.\n\nIn order to facilitate the proper identification and management of risks and opportunities related to climate change, a Group policy was published in 2021 that describes common guidelines for assessing the risks and opportunities arising from climate change. The \u201cClimate change risks and opportunities\u201d policy defines a shared approach for the integration of climate change and energy transition issues into the Group\u2019s processes and activities, thus informing industrial and strategic choices to improve business resilience and long-term sustainable value creation, consistent with the adaptation and mitigation strategy. The main steps considered in the policy are as follows:\n\n- **Prioritizing phenomena and scenario analysis.** These activities include the identification of physical and transition phenomena relevant to the Group and the consequent development of scenarios to be considered and developed through analysis and processing of data from internal and external sources. Functions can be developed for the phenomena identified that link the scenarios (e.g. data on the change in renewables) to business operations (e.g. the change in potential output);\n- **Impact assessment.** Includes all analyses and activities necessary to quantify the effects at the operational, economic and financial levels, depending on the processes into which these are integrated (e.g. design of new constructions or operational performance appraisal, etc.);\n- **Operational and strategic actions.** Information from previous activities is integrated into processes, informing Group decisions and business activities. Examples of activities and processes that benefit are capital allocation, e.g. for evaluating investments on existing assets or new projects; defining resilience plans, risk management and financing activities and engineering and business development activities.\n\nIn order to identify the main types of risk and opportunity and their impact on the business associated with them in a structured manner consistent with the TCFD, we have adopted a framework that explicitly represents the main relationships between scenario variables and types of risk and opportunity, specifying the strategic and operational approaches to managing them, comprising mitigation and adaptation measures. Two main macro-categories of risks/opportunities are identified:\n\n- those connected with developments in physical variables;\n- those connected to the evolution of the transition scenarios.\n\nThe physical risks are divided into acute (or extreme events) and chronic: the former are linked to extremely intense weather-climatic conditions, while the latter are linked to gradual and enduring changes in climatic conditions. Extreme events expose the Group to: potential unavailability of assets and infrastructure for longer or shorter periods of time, service restoration costs, inconvenience for customers, etc. Chronic changes in climatic conditions, on the other hand, expose the Group to other risks or opportunities: for example, structural temperature changes can impact electricity demand and affect generation, while changes in rainfall or wind patterns could impact the Group\u2019s business in terms of lower or higher output. Generally speaking, adapting to the changes that will most likely take place in the future also leads to efforts in innovation and strategic positioning: it may be possible to develop new businesses and better products in order to live sustainably in a changed environment.\n\nWith regard to the energy transition process, marked by a progressive reduction in CO\u2082 emissions, there are risks and opportunities associated with the changing regulatory and legislative context, with trends in technological and competitive development, with electrification and behavior, and with the resulting market trends. In line with the climate and transition scenarios that Enel has used to define risks and opportunities, it appears that the main phenomena related to the transition are now becoming evident depending on the behavior adopted by customers, the industrial strategies adopted by various sectors of the economy and regulatory policies, including fiscal policies. By the year 2030, transition trends will be observable as the context evolves: the Enel Group has decided to lead and pave the way for the transition, and is prepared to seize any associated opportunities. As previously mentioned, strategic choices that focus strongly on energy transition, with more than 90% of investments being dedicated to improving some of the SDGs, make it possible to adopt risk mitigation \u201cby design\u201d and to maximize opportunities by maintaining a position that takes into consideration the identified medium and long-term phenomena. Strategic choices go hand in hand with the operational best practices implemented by the Group.\n| Scenario phenomena | Time horizon | Risk & opportunity driver | Description | Management approach |\n|--------------------|--------------|---------------------------|-------------|---------------------|\n| Acute physical     | Starting with short term (1-3 years) | Extreme events | Risk: especially extreme weather/climate events, which can damage assets and interrupt operations. | The Group adopts best practices to manage the restoration of service as quickly as possible. We also work to implement investments in resilience (e.g., the Italian case). With regard to risk assessment in insurance, the Group has a loss prevention program for property risk that also assesses the main exposures to natural events, supported by preventive maintenance activities and internal risk management policies. Looking forward, the assessments will also include the potential impacts of long-term trends in the most significant climate variables. |\n| Chronic physical   | Starting with long term (2030-2050) | Market | Risk/opportunity: increase or decrease in electricity demand under influence of temperature, whose variations can impact the business. Increase or decrease in renewables output, which may be affected by structural changes in resource availability. | The Group\u2019s geographical and technological diversification means that the impact of changes (positive and negative) in a single variable is mitigated at the global level. In order to ensure that operations always take account of weather and climate phenomena, the Group adopts a range of practices such as, for example, weather forecasting, real-time monitoring of plants and long-term climate scenarios to identify any chronic changes in renewable source availability. |\n| Transition         | Starting with short term (1-3 years) | Policy & Regulation | Risk/opportunity: policies on CO\u2082 prices and emissions, energy transition incentives and policies, revision of market design and permitting procedures, and resilience regulation. | The Group is minimizing its exposure to risks through progressive decarbonization and the focus of the business on renewables, grids and customers. The business model is designed to maximize the benefits of our integrated position in the core countries and leveraging stewardship activities, which enables us to exploit the opportunities connected with the energy transition. The Group is also actively contributing to the formation of public policies through its advocacy efforts. These activities are conducted within platforms for dialogue with stakeholders that explore ambitious national decarbonization scenarios in the various countries in which Enel operates. |\n| Transition         | Starting with medium term (2022-2030) | Market | Risk/opportunity: changes in the prices of commodities and energy, evolution of energy mix, changes in retail consumption, changes in competitive environment. | The Group is maximizing opportunities by adopting a strategy founded on the energy transition, focusing on the electrification of energy consumption and the development of renewables and a geographical positioning in countries in which we have an integrated presence. Considering alternative transition scenarios, the Group assesses the impact of different commodity price trends, changes in the share of renewables in the generation mix and the electrification of final consumption. |\n| Transition         | Starting with medium term (2022-2030) | Product and Services | Opportunity: increase in margins and greater scope for investment as a consequence of the transition in terms of greater penetration of electrical mobility, distributed generation and new technologies for the direct and indirect electrification of final consumption. | The Group is maximizing opportunities thanks to its strong positioning in new businesses and beyond-commodity services. In addition, considering alternative transition scenarios, the Group assesses the impact of different trends in the electrification of consumption. |\n| Transition         | Starting with medium term (2022-2030) | Technology | | The Group is maximizing opportunities thanks to its strong strategic positioning in new businesses and global grids. With the penetration of direct and indirect electrification technologies, considering alternative scenarios, the Group assesses the potential opportunities for scaling existing and potential businesses and for the development of new solutions linked to digitalization and resilience of power grids. |\nThe framework outlined above also highlights the relationships that link the physical and transition scenarios with the potential impact on the Group\u2019s business. These effects can be assessed over three time horizons: the short-medium term (1\u20133 years), in which sensitivity analyses based on the Strategic Plan presented to investors in 2022 can be performed; medium-term (until 2029), in which it is possible to assess the effects of the energy transition; and long-term (2030\u20132050), in which chronic structural changes in the climate should begin to emerge.\n\nThe following will describe the main sources of risks and opportunities identified, operational best practices for managing weather and climate phenomena, and qualitative and quantitative impact assessments conducted to date. All of the above activities are performed throughout the year through an ongoing effort to analyze, evaluate and manage the information processed. As TCFD states, the process of disclosing risks and opportunities related to climate change will be gradual and incremental from year to year.\n\n**Transition phenomena: business effects, risks and opportunities**\n\nAs regards the risks and opportunities associated with transition variables, we consider the different reference scenarios in combination with the elements that make up the risk identification process (e.g. competitive context, long-term vision of the industry, materiality analysis, technological evolution etc.) to identify the drivers of potential risks and opportunities, with priority on events with greater relevancy. The main identified risks and opportunities are described below.\n\n**Policy and Regulation**\n\n- **Limits on emissions and carbon pricing**: the enactment of laws and regulations that introduce more stringent emissions limits by government action (non-market driven) and market-based mechanisms.\n  - **Opportunities**: Command & Control regulations and market-based mechanisms strengthening CO\u2082 price signals to foster investment in carbon-free technologies.\n  - **Risks**: lack of a coordinated approach among the various actors and policy-makers involved and limited effectiveness of the policy instruments deployed, with an impact on the speed of the trend toward electrification and decarbonization in the various sectors, compared with a decisive group strategy focused on the energy transition.\n\n- **Policies and regulation to accelerate the energy transition and energy security**: introducing policies, regulatory frameworks and market design revisions that promote the energy transition, consequently guiding the energy system toward the use of renewable energy sources as the mainstream approach in the energy mixes of countries, greater consumer electrification, energy efficiency, flexibility of the electrical system and upgrading of infrastructure.\n  - **Opportunities**: creating a more favorable framework for investing in renewables, also through the development of long-term markets (PPAs, CfDs), electrical technologies and distribution networks in line with the Group\u2019s strategy.\n  - **Risks**: lengthy administrative authorization processes and ineffective market design and regulatory frameworks in core countries can lead to reduced asset profitability and limited opportunities for growth.\n\n- **Resilience regulation and adaptation**: improvement of standards or introduction of ad hoc mechanisms to regulate investments in resilience in the context of the evolution of climate change.\n  - **Opportunities**: benefits from investments that reduce service quality and continuity risks for the community.\n  - **Risks**: in the case of especially severe extreme events with a greater-than-expected impact, there is a risk of failure to recover within an adequate timeframe and consequently a risk to Enel\u2019s reputation.\n\n- **Financial measures for the energy transition**: developing policies and financial instruments that promote the energy transition, which should be capable of supporting an investment framework and a long-term, credible and stable positioning of policy-makers. Introduction of rules and/or public and private financial instruments (e.g. funds, mechanisms, taxonomies, benchmarks) aimed at integrating sustainability into financial markets and public finance instruments.\nOpportunities: the creation of new markets and sustainable finance products consistent with the investment framework, activating greater public resources for decarbonization and access to financial resources in line with energy transition objectives and the related impact on costs and on finance charges; introduction of subsidized support tools (funds and calls) for the transition.\n\nRisks: actions and instruments not sufficient to provide incentives consistent with an overall positioning tailored to the energy transition, uncertainty or slowdown in the introduction of new instruments and rules due to the deterioration in finances.\n\nMarket\n\nCommodity price dynamics: changes in market dynamics, such as those relating to commodity price volatility, may influence the behavior of traders, policy makers and customers.\n\nOpportunities: accelerating clean electrification as a solution for cutting energy costs and limiting exposure to commodity volatility. Customers are more likely to switch from conventional fossil-fuel technologies to efficient electrical technologies.\n\nRisks: a \u201cdisorderly\u201d energy transition due to the introduction of potentially distortive measures.\n\nMarket dynamics: end users are more likely to choose more sustainable technologies as they are more aware of climate change risks and due to greater regulatory pressure.\n\nOpportunities: positive effects associated with the growth in electricity demand and the greater room for renewables, also thanks to an increased demand for long-term contracts (PPAs).\n\nTechnology\n\nTechnology penetration to support the transition: gradual penetration of new technologies such as storage, demand response and green hydrogen; digital lever for transforming operating models and \u201cplatform\u201d business models.\n\nOpportunities: investments in the development of technology solutions, as well as positive impacts from increased electricity demand and increased room for renewables from green hydrogen generation.\n\nRisks: slowdowns and interruptions to the raw materials supply chain, including metals for batteries (such as lithium, nickel and cobalt) and semiconductors, could lead to delays in procurement and/or increased costs, such as to slow down the penetration of renewables, storage and electric vehicles.\n\nProducts and services\n\nElectrification of residential consumption and industrial processes: with the gradual electrification of end uses, the penetration of products with lower costs and a smaller impact in terms of residential emissions will expand (for example, the use of heat pumps for heating and cooling).\n\nOpportunities: increase in electrical consumption in the context of reducing energy consumption, thanks to the improved efficiency of the electric carrier. More opportunities to provide beyond commodity services and the chance of reducing the energy expenditure and carbon footprint of customers. Increasing investment in networks to drive consumer electrification.\n\nRisks: additional competition in this market segment. This phenomenon depends on whether electricity networks are well developed, which is crucial for ensuring increasing load levels and service continuity.\n\nElectric mobility: use of more efficient and effective modes of transportation from the point of view of climate change, with a special focus on the development of electric mobility and charging infrastructure; electrification of large-scale industrial consumers.\n\nOpportunities: positive effects of the increase in electricity demand and greater margins connected with the penetration of electric transportation and the relative beyond commodity services.\n\nRisks: additional competition in this market segment.\n\nThe Group has already implemented strategic actions to mitigate the potential risks and exploit the opportunities associated with transition variables. Shared long-term value can be created through an industrial and financial strategy that incorporates ESG factors, with an integrated approach focusing on sustainability and innovation. The strategy focusing on full decarbonization and energy transition enables the Group to be resilient to risks resulting from the introduction of more ambitious policies for reducing emissions. It also maximizes opportunities for developing renewable generation, infrastructure and enabling technologies, partly through geographic positioning in countries with an integrated presence and by promoting stewardship activities.\nTo quantify the risks and opportunities deriving from the energy transition in the long term, two transition scenarios, described in the paragraph \u201cEnergy transition scenarios\u201d. The effects of Slower Transition and Accelerated Transition scenarios have therefore been identified on the variables that can have the greatest impact on the business, in particular electricity demand, influenced by the dynamics of consumer electrification, and therefore of penetration of electrical technologies and the electricity generation mix. These considerations offer a basis for determining the Group\u2019s strategic positioning in terms of resource allocation.\n\nEnel\u2019s reference scenario \u2013 the Paris scenario \u2013 entails a growing ambition in terms of decarbonization and energy efficiency, supported by greater electrification of final energy consumption and the development of renewable capacity. The dynamics related to the energy transition will bring increasing opportunities to the Group. In particular, in the retail electricity market, progressive electrification of final energy consumption \u2013 especially for transport and the residential sector \u2013 will lead to a considerable increase in electrical consumption to the detriment of other, more high-emissions energy carriers. Similarly, the gradual increase in the proportion of renewable energy in the energy mix is expected to lead to a reduction in the wholesale price of electricity in the medium to long term. However, this impact is limited, given that the market design based on the system marginal price is unchanged in the medium term. Possible alternative market structures could induce different effects.\n\nIn reference to the economic impacts that may result from the change in the transition scenarios, the Group has performed some analyses regarding impacts in terms of EBITDA that the Slower Transition and Accelerated Transition scenarios would bring to the 2030 results compared to the baseline Paris scenario.\n\nWith reference to consumer electrification, the Slower Transition scenario encompasses lower penetration rates of the most efficient electrical technologies, in particular electric cars and heat pumps, causing a decrease in electricity demand compared to the Paris scenario, which is estimated to cause limited impacts on the Retail commodity business & beyond. At the same time, lower electricity demand results in less development space for renewable capacity, with impacts on the generation business.\n\nWith reference to the Accelerated scenario, a more rapid reduction in the cost of green hydrogen generation technologies is assumed. This results in a higher penetration of this energy carrier, at the expense of blue and gray hydrogen, with a consequent additional effect on domestic electricity demand and renewable capacity installations compared to the Paris scenario.\n\nFor the different countries and regions, all scenarios, but to a greater extent the Paris and Accelerated scenarios, will involve a considerable increase in the complexities that will have to be managed by the grids. A significant increase is expected in fact in distributed generation and in other resources, such as storage systems, greater penetration of electric mobility with the relative charging infrastructures, as well as the increasing rate of electrification of consumption and the introduction of new actors with new methods of consumption. This context will involve a decentralization of the extraction/feed-in points, an increase in electric demand and the average requested power, a considerable variation in energy flows, which will require dynamic and flexible grid management. The Group therefore expects that in this scenario incremental investments will be necessary to guarantee the connections and suitable levels of quality and resilience, by promoting the adoption of innovative operating models. These investments must be accompanied by coherent policy and regulation scenarios to guarantee suitable economic returns for the Enel Grids Business Line.\n| Category          | Time horizon | Main drivers                                      | Scenario                                                                 | Quantification - range | Mitigation Actions |\n|-------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|\n| Market            | Medium       | Electrification trend and unit consumption        | **Accelerated**: increase in average unit consumption thanks to greater electrification.

Basically, even though weather changes are being recorded, which are often significant, it is nevertheless difficult to determine in the short term whether certain phenomena are changing structurally, that is, whether average reference values are already changing. This can be established in the long run with probability intervals.\n\nThe main impacts of chronic physical changes can produce similar effects on the following variables:\n\n- **electricity demand**: variation in the average temperature level with a potential increase or reduction in electricity demand;\n- **thermal generation**: variation in the level and average temperatures of the oceans and rivers, with effects on thermal generation;\n- **hydroelectric generation**: variation in the average level of rainfall and snowfall and temperatures with a potential increase and/or reduction in hydroelectric generation;\n- **solar generation**: variation in the average level of solar radiation, temperature and rainfall with a potential increase or reduction in solar generation;\n- **wind generation**: variation in the average wind level with a potential increase or reduction in wind generation.\n\nThe Group is working to estimate the relationships between changes in physical variables and the change in the potential output of individual plants in the different categories of generation technology. As part of the assessment of the effects of long-term climate change, chronic events relevant to each technology were identified and analyses of their impacts on manufacturability were initiated.\n\n| Event | Rain/snow | Wind | Solar radiation | Sea level | Air temperature | River/sea temperature |\n|-------|-----------|------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| Thermal | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf |\n| Solar | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf |\n| Wind | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf |\n| Hydro | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf |\n| Storage | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf |\n| Geothermal | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf |\n| Enel Grids | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf |\n| Enel X Global Retail | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf | \u25cf |\nThe initial scenario analysis has shown that chronic structural changes in the recent trends of physical variables will begin to occur in a considerable manner starting from 2030. However, in order to obtain an indicative estimate of the potential impacts, and include the possibility of the early onset of chronic effects, it is possible to test sensitivity of the Industrial Plan to the factors potentially influenced by the physical scenario, regardless of any direct relationship with climate variables. The existing Industrial Plan was created based on the information contained in the average scenarios for chronic phenomena, so that the possible effects of trends in climatic variables could also be taken into consideration.\n\nAnalyses of the impact of chronic climate change on renewable generation\n\nA number of ad hoc functions were created for each renewable technology (wind, solar and hydroelectric) and plant in order to calculate the impact of the chronic effects of climate change on the generation of our assets. For each variation in climate variables (such as temperature, radiation, wind speed and rainfall), these functions associate likely changes in the electrical output of the plants in our portfolio. The first step in calibrating these \u201clink\u201d functions was to use the historical data of the weather-climate variables and the internal references of the observed energy output of our plant fleet. This allowed us to obtain \u201clink\u201d functions that meet the specific characteristics of each renewable plant and technology. As a result, we were able to study the chronic climate impacts for possible future forecasts of climate variables (RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios).\n\nIn addition to chronic phenomena involving average structural changes, it is also important to study the volatility that is characteristic of weather and, consequently, more short-term. Information obtained from the ranges of variation of chronic trends predicted by climate scenarios was taken as input for strategic planning, as was the historical volatility of meteorological data by analyzing variations in electricity generation (TWh) over the last 10 years. Weather and climate fluctuations can lead to adjustments, since the output of power plants feeds sourcing for selling energy to customers. This means that reductions in the amount of energy used for renewable generation may lead to sourcing imbalances, which may result in missing volumes being purchased on the market in order to drive the business strategy. On the other hand, increased generation from renewable sources may lead to reduced purchases of volumes on the market (or even more sales). Based on the analyses conducted at each plant, which were then aggregated, it was calculated that, on average, hydroelectric generation may slightly decrease in the future (with substantial differences between sites), with average variations at country level ranging between -1% and -5% in the 2030-2050 period in the RCP 2.6 scenario compared to historical values. The average changes in wind power output will largely depend on the location of the assets, with minor variations that can be either positive or negative. Ultimately, the effects for solar technology will be mostly positive, with average increases at a country level of up to 3% in the 2030-2050 period in the RCP 2.6 scenario. Such effects, aggregated at portfolio level, highlight the fact that the geographical and technological diversification plays a role in balancing the different variations.\n\nAcute physical risks\n\nWith regard to acute physical phenomena (extreme events), their intensity and frequency can cause significant and unexpected physical damage to assets and generate negative externalities associated with the interruption of service. Within the scope of scenarios regarding climate change, the acute physical component continues playing an extremely important role when defining the risks to which the Group is exposed, both due to the wide geographical diversification of its asset portfolio and due to the primary importance of the renewable natural resources for the generation of electricity. In the various cases, the acute physical phenomena such as wind storms, floods, heat waves, severe cold, etc., demonstrate a high level of intensity yet do not have a very high occurrence frequency in the short term, but, considering the medium and long-term climatic scenarios, this will increase considerably in the future. Hence, for the reasons described above, the Group is currently managing the risk deriving from extreme events in the short term. At the same time, it is extending its methodology also to longer time periods (until 2050) according to the identified climate change scenarios (RCP 8.5, 4.5 and 2.6).\nMethodology for evaluating the risk of extreme events\n\nIn order to quantify the risk deriving from extreme events, the Group refers to a consolidated methodology for analyzing the catastrophic risk used in the insurance sector and in IPCC reports. Through its own insurance business units and the captive insurance company Enel Insurance NV, the Group is managing the various phases connected to risks deriving from natural catastrophes: from the assessment and quantification to the corresponding coverages to minimize the impacts. The methodology applies to all extreme events that can be analyzed, such as wind storms, heat waves, tropical cyclones, floods, etc. In all of these types of natural catastrophes, however, three independent factors can be identified that are summarized below.\n\n- The probability of the event (\"hazard\"), that is, its theoretical frequency over a specific period of time: the \"return time\". In other words, a catastrophic event that has a return time of 250 years, for example, implies that it can be associated with a probability of 0.4% that it will occur in a year. This information, which is necessary for assessing the frequency of the event, is then associated with its geographical distribution with respect to the various areas where portfolio assets are located.\n\n- Therefore, for this purpose, the Group uses \"hazard maps\" which associate, for the various types of natural catastrophes, each geographical points on the global map with the corresponding estimate of the frequency associated with the extreme event. This information, which is organized in geo-referenced databases, is provided by global reinsurance companies, meteorological consultancy companies or academic institutions.\n\n- The vulnerability, that, in percentage terms, indicates how much value is lost and/or damaged upon occurrence of the catastrophic event. In more specific terms, therefore, it is possible to refer to the damage to the material assets the impact on the continuity of generation and/or distribution of electricity, and also the provision of the electric services offered to the end user.\n\n- The Group creates and promotes specific vulnerability analyses, especially in the case of damage to its assets, related to every technology in its portfolio: solar, wind and hydroelectric power plants, transmission and distribution networks, primary and secondary substations, etc. These analyses are then, of course, focused on the extreme events that have greater impact on the various types of technology; as a result, this defines a matrix that associates the individual natural catastrophic events with the corresponding type of asset that is impacted in a considerable manner.\n\n- The exposure, which is the set of economic values in the Group portfolio that can be considerably impacted by the occurrence of natural catastrophic events. Also in this case, the scopes of the analyses are specific to the various generation technologies, for network assets and for the services to the end user.\n\nThe combination of the three factors described above (hazard, vulnerability and exposure) provide the fundamental element for assessing the risk deriving from extreme events. From this point of view, the Group differentiates the risk analysis with respect to the climate change scenarios, depending on the specific nature of the various associated time periods. The following table summarizes the scheme adopted for the evaluation of impacts deriving from acute physical phenomena.\n\n| Time horizon | Hazard | Vulnerability | Exposure |\n|--------------|--------|--------------|----------|\n| Short term (1-3 years) | Hazard maps based on historical data and meteorological models | Vulnerability, being related to the type of extreme event, to the specifics of the damage type and to the technical requirements of the technology under consideration | Group values in the short term |\n| Long term (at 2050 and/or 2100) | Hazard maps and specific studies for different IPCC RCP climate scenarios | Vulnerability is essentially independent of time horizons | Long-term evolution of Group values |\n\n(11) L.

It is possible to distinguish two main types of actions: defining an effective insurance coverage and the various climate change adaptation activities related to preventing damage that could result from extreme events. The main components of these actions are described below and, in the case of activities related to preventing and mitigating the damage, specific reference is made to the Group\u2019s Generation and Infrastructure and Networks Global Business Lines.\n\nImpacts of acute physical events on the Group\n\nThe Enel Group has a well-diversified portfolio in terms of technologies, country and regional distribution and asset size. Consequently, the exposure of the portfolio to natural risks is also diversified. The Group implements various risk mitigation measures which, as will be described below, include both insurance coverage and other managerial and operational actions aimed at further reducing the Company\u2019s risk profile.\n\nIndeed, empirical evidence shows negligible repercussions of such risks, as demonstrated by data for the last 5 years. Considering the most relevant events, defined as those with a gross impact >10 million euros, the cumulative value of the gross impact amounts to ~130 million euros, which represents less than 0.06% of the Group\u2019s insured values as of 2022, or ~224 billion euros, most of which are recovered through insurance payouts.\n\nEnel Group insurances\n\nEvery year, the Group defines global insurance programs for its business in the various countries where it operates. The two main programs, in terms of scope of coverage and volumes, are as follows:\n\n- the Property Program (\u201cProperty Damage and Business Interruption Insurance Program\u201d) for material damage that can be caused to the assets and the resulting interruption in business. Therefore, in addition to the cost for the new reconstruction of the asset (or its parts), also the economic losses due to their shutdown in terms of gen-\neration and/or distribution of electricity are also remunerated according to the limits and conditions defined in the policies;\n\n- the Liability Program (\"General & Environmental Liability Insurance Program\"), which covers third party damage following the impacts that extreme events can have on the assets and on the Group\u2019s business.\n\nStarting from an effective assessment of the risk, suitable limits and insurance conditions can be defined in the insurance policies and this also applies in the case of natural extreme events related to climate change. In fact, in this latter case, the impacts on business can be considerable but, as shown in cases that occurred in the past and in various areas around the world, the Group has shown absolute resilience thanks to the wide insurance coverage limits, which are also the result of a solid reinsurance structure, as regards the Group\u2019s captive company Enel Insurance NV.\n\nIn this context of effective insurance coverage, the measures implemented by the Group with regard to the preventive maintenance of electricity generation and network assets are equally important. In fact, while the effects of such activities are directly reflected in the mitigation of the impacts of extreme events, they are also an essential prerequisite for optimizing risk financing and for minimizing \u2013 compared to the insurance market \u2013 the costs of global hedging programs, including the risk associated with natural catastrophic events. This adaptive strategy consists of managerial strategies and actions, not only related to insurance, which change according to boundary conditions; for instance, the Group was able to substantially reverse the sharp upward trend in premiums in insurance markets by modifying its risk retention policies for assets and by implementing internal risk transfer policies that reward better performing Business Lines when it comes to risk mitigation. From this perspective, the method and information extracted from ex-post event analyses play a crucial role in defining processes and practices for mitigating similar events in the future.\n\nAs part of the Property Program, Enel Insurance NV envisages a Premium Refund program for Business Lines related to the loss ratio and the achievement of the Group\u2019s SDG goals, thereby contributing to the virtuous circle linked to the Group\u2019s adaptation to the challenges posed by climate change.\n\nFor further information, please read the 2022 Integrated Annual Report.\n\n**Enel\u2019s resilience and adaptation to climate change**\n\nThe application of long-term climate scenarios makes it possible to prepare adaptation plans for the Group\u2019s portfolio of assets and activities. Climate scenarios are developed by identifying the physical phenomena that are most relevant to each business (such as heat waves, extreme rainfall, fire risk, etc.) in order to produce analyses that provide not only high-level indications (such as country risk indices that can be compared with each other), which make it possible to study physical impacts at an individual site. This approach applies to both the existing portfolio and to new investments.\n\nBy assessing the vulnerability of assets, priority actions to increase resilience can be identified.\nADAPTATION: a climate-proof future\n\nWe are building a climate-proof company, combining mitigation efforts with the ability to understand change and deliver solutions aimed at maintaining profitability and promoting resilient growth models for the benefit of all stakeholders.\n\n\u201cAdaptation to climate change is only possible by taking a multidisciplinary approach. At Group Strategy, we work together and exchange views with climate change experts in order to translate the latest knowledge into useful information for the Group. Along with all business lines, we apply instruments and expertise so that we can develop solutions that will increase our resilience, our ability to deal with adverse events and to design products and services that support stakeholders\u2019 adaptation.\u201d\n\nSince 2018, the Group has been working with the International Center for Theoretical Physics in Trieste to define climate scenarios for the next 30 years and even longer. Since then, we have continued to develop instruments and skills in order to manage, understand and apply a huge amount of data. We now provide the Group with global climate analyses, which are based on data gathered both independently by the scientific community and through partnerships with academic and private institutions and innovation challenges. These analyses look at three different climate scenarios that cover all possible futures.\n\nA project to define a Climate Change Adaptation Plan was launched in 2022, involving staff departments and business lines, with the aim of translating the study of complex physical phenomena and asset vulnerability into tangible actions. The goal is to increase business resilience, enhancing responsiveness to adverse events and seizing opportunities by creating products and services that will benefit customers and all stakeholders. Besides using high-resolution data and carrying out detailed analyses of individual assets, the approach that was adopted enables global climate risk to be assessed by comparing the evolution of several extreme events in the different countries.\n\nFor example, one of several results achieved in collaboration with EGP was the calculation of the expected variation in renewable output from hydroelectric, wind and solar plants between 2030 and 2050. A further example is the study, conducted with Enel Grids, which has estimated that breakdowns could potentially increase as a result of increased heat waves in Italy between 2030 and 2050. These works will continue by incorporating more and more Adaptation into all of the Group\u2019s processes so that, by working together, we can build a climate-proof future.\nAdaptation activities\n\nThe Group implements solutions to climate change adaptation by taking a comprehensive approach, which involves assessing the potential impacts in order to properly target the measures required to improve the ability to respond to adverse events (Response Management) and to increase business resilience (Resiliency Measures), consequently reducing the risk of adverse events having a negative impact in the future. Moreover, the Group will use the expertise and instruments developed to analyze the effects of climate change in order to create value by devising new business options aimed at offering solutions that will make the adaptation process easier for communities and all stakeholders.\n\nAdaptation solutions may concern both actions implemented in short-term and long-term decision making, such as the planning of investments in response to climate phenomena. Adaptation activities also include procedures, policies and best practices.\n\nFor new investments, action can also be taken early in the design and construction phase to reduce the impact of climate risks by design, for example by taking into consideration climate scenarios and analyses of the vulnerability of assets to specific phenomena in order to implement resilient solutions.\n\nThe following table shows a high-level summary that represents the type of actions that Enel implements for proper management of adverse events and to increase resilience to weather phenomena and their evolution due to climate change. Several activities are described in greater detail below.\n\n| Business Lines | A. Resiliency Measures - Enhancing asset resilience | B.

Enel X Critical Event Management |\n\nGeneration assets resilience\n\nWith regard to generation, over time the Group has carried out targeted actions on specific sites and established ad hoc management activities and processes.\n\nActions on specific sites in recent years include, for example:\n\n- improving cooling water management systems for certain plants in order to counter the problems caused by the decline in water levels in rivers, such as the Po in Italy.\n- installing fogging systems to improve the flow of inlet air and offset the reduction in power output caused by the increase in ambient temperature in CCGTs.\n- installing drainage pumps, raising embankments, periodic cleaning of canals and interventions to consolidate land adjacent to plants to prevent landslides in order to mitigate flood risks.\n- periodic site-specific reassessment for the hydroelectric plants for flood scenarios using numeric simulations. The processed scenarios are managed with mitigation actions and through interventions on the civil works, dams and intake systems.\nThe Group adopts several best practices to properly manage the impact of weather events on electricity generation, such as:\n\n- **weather forecasting** both to monitor renewable resource availability and detect extreme events, with warning systems to ensure the protection of people and assets;\n- **hydrological simulations, territory surveys** (also using drones), monitoring of possible vulnerabilities using digital GIS systems (Geographic Information System) and satellite measurements;\n- **advanced monitoring of more than 100,000 parameters** (with more than 160 million historical measurements) detected on dams and hydroelectric civil works;\n- **real-time remote monitoring of power plants**;\n- **safe rooms in areas exposed** to tornadoes and hurricanes, such as wind plants in Oklahoma, USA;\n- **adoption of specific guidelines for carrying out hydrological and hydraulic studies** that are targeted, from the first development phases, toward assessing risks inside the plant and toward the external areas of the plant, with the application of the principle of hydraulic invariance during the design of the draining and mitigation works;\n- **check of potential climatic trends for the main project parameters** in order to keep the dimensioning of the systems into account for relevant projects (for example: assessments of the temperature of a cold source to guarantee greater flexibility for cooling the new CCGT) and specific civil works (for example: rainfall assessments for the design of drainage systems in solar plants);\n- **estimate of extreme wind speed using updated databases** containing the registers and historical trajectories of hurricanes and tropical storms, with the resulting selection of the wind turbine technology that is best suited to the conditions that were found.\n\nIn order to be able to promptly react to adverse events, the Group also implements dedicated emergency management procedures with real-time communication protocols, planning and management of all activities to restore operating assets in a short space of time, as well as standard checklists for assessing damage, ensuring that all plants can be put back into service as safely and quickly as possible. One way of minimizing the impacts of climate phenomena is the Lesson Learned feedback process, which is implemented by the technical departments, is governed by the existing operating model and influences future projects.\n\n**Grid assets resilience**\n\nIn order to deal with extreme climatic events, in the Grids Business Line, the Enel Group has adopted an approach called \u201c4R\u201d which, in a dedicated Policy that aims to ensure an innovative strategy for the resilience of distribution networks, defines the measures to be adopted in the phase of preparation for an emergency on the network and to ensure swift restoration of services ex post, i.e. once the climatic events have caused damage to assets and/or disconnections. The 4R strategy is divided into four phases:\n\n1. **Risk Prevention**: includes actions that make it possible to reduce the probability of losing grid elements due to an event and/or to minimize its effects, such as interventions able to increase the robustness of the infrastructure and maintenance operations. When choosing technical solutions to increase resilience, a catalogue is used to determine which is the best way to intervene for each climatic event and geographic area;\n\n2. **Readiness**: comprises all measures that aim to improve the timeliness with which potentially critical events are identified, ensuring coordination with the Civil Protection Department and local officials, as well as to prepare the necessary resources once a grid disconnection has occurred;\n\n3. **Response**: represents the phase for assessing the operating capacity for facing an emergency when an extreme event occurs, which is directly correlated to the ability to mobilize operating resources in the field and the possibility to perform remote controlled operations to restore service via resilient backup connections;\n\n4. **Recovery**: the final phase which has the goal of reconnecting the grid as soon as possible with ordinary operating conditions, in the cases in which an extreme weather event cause interruptions in service in spite of the previously adopted measures for increasing resilience.\n\nFollowing this approach, the Business Line has prepared various policies on specific actions aimed at dealing with the various aspects and risks inherent in Climate Change, in particular:\n\n- **Policy for preparation and recovery during emergencies**: a policy related to the last 3 steps of the 4R approach which indicates the guidelines and measures targeted toward improving the preparation strategies, mitigating the impact of total interruptions and, finally, restoring service to the largest number of customers possible as quickly as possible.\n\n- **Guidelines for the Resilience Plan of the electricity grid**: a dedicated policy has the objective of identifying the extraordinary climatic events with the greatest impact on the grid, assessing specific KPIs of the AS-I5 grid and improving them on the basis of proposed actions in order to finally assess their order of priority. This makes it possible to select the actions that, when implemented, minimize the impact on the grid of particularly critical extreme events in a certain area/region. The Policy is therefore set in the first two phases of the 4R approach, suggesting measures regarding Risk Prevention and Readiness. In Italy, this Policy translates into the Resilience Plan that e-distribuzione has prepared every year.\nsince 2017, and which represents and addendum to the Development Plan that includes ad hoc investments over a 3 year period that aim to reduce the impact of extreme events belonging to a certain critical cluster: heat waves, ice loads and wind storms (falling of tall trees). Around 672 million euros were invested in the period 2017-2021 and a further 262 million euros will also be used in the following three years, as explained in the addendum to the 2022-2024 Plan. In the face of these risks, investments have been planned such as the targeted replacement of bare conductors with insulated cable, in some cases the burying of cables, or solutions that provide re-powering routes that are not vulnerable to the above-mentioned phenomena. As in Italy, similar topics are being examined in other countries too, such as Europe and South America, so as to prepare a process for planning ad hoc investments that can increase the resilience of grids to extreme events, while taking into consideration the specific characteristics of each territory.\n\n- **Policy on the prevention and preparation of the risk of fire for electrical installations**: a policy dedicated to fire risk defines an integrated approach to emergency management applied to forest fires, both in cases in which they are started by events exogenous to the networks and in cases, albeit rare, in which they are caused by the networks themselves and, in any case, are potentially dangerous for Enel plants. The document sets out the guidelines to be implemented in the various areas of presence so as to identify areas/plants at risk, define specific prevention measures (such as evaluating specific maintenance plans and any strengthening measures) and, in the event of a fire, to manage the emergency in the best possible way so as to limit its impact and resume the service as quickly as possible.\n\n- **The implementation of systems for weather forecasting, grid monitoring** and assessing the impact of critical climate phenomena on the grid, preparation of operational plans and organization of special exercises. In this regard, it is particularly important to have prior agreements in place for mobilizing extraordinary resources \u2013 which are identified beforehand in order to deal with the emergency \u2013 whether internal or from contracting companies. For instance, in Italy, besides installing and putting into operation three experimental stations in order to observe and investigate the phenomenon of ice-sleeve formation on MV conductors, IoT sensor trials were conducted for monitoring overhead lines in areas that are particularly exposed to snow and wind (Newman project).\n\n### Inclusion of climate change effects in the evaluation of new projects\n\nMany activities related to the evaluation and implementation of new projects can benefit from climate analyses, both general and site-specific, which the Group is beginning to integrate with those already considered in the evaluation of new projects. For example:\n\n- **Preliminary studies**: in this stage, climate data can offer preliminary screening, through the analysis of specific climate phenomena, such as those shown above in the analysis of physical scenarios, and summary indicators such as the Climate Risk Index, integrated into the Open Country Risk. These data provide a preliminary measure of the most relevant phenomena in the area, among those identified as being of interest for each technology.\n\n- **Estimation of potential output**: climate scenarios will be progressively integrated to allow for an assessment of how climate change will modify the availability of the renewable resource at the specific site. In the preliminary analysis of the impact of chronic climate change on renewable power generation, the approach applied for the moment on a few pilot sites and then scaled to the entire generation portfolio is described.\n\n- **Environmental impact analysis**: the Group has begun to integrate the Climate Change Risk Assessment into the set of documentation produced, which contains a representation of the main physical phenomena and their expected change in the area.\n\n- **Resilient design**: as described above, among the climate change adaptation activities, those aimed at devising resilient assets by design take on great importance. The Group is working to consider progressively analyses based on climate data, for example the increase in frequency and intensity of acute events. These will complement existing analyses based on historical data already in use, in order to increase the resilience of future assets, including any adaptation actions that may be required over the life of the project.\nEnel\u2019s performance in fighting against climate change\n\nOur carbon footprint\n\n| Total direct GHG emissions Scope 1 (MtCO\u2082eq) | Total indirect GHG emissions Scope 2

emissions from biomass, which amounted to 114,838 tCO\u2082 in 2022 (125,878 tCO\u2082 in 2021), were not included as they cannot be considered within Scope 1, while CH\u2084 and N\u2082O emissions were considered.\n(2) NF\u2086 losses were 14 tCO\u2082 in 2021 and 4 tCO\u2082 in 2022.\n(3) CH\u2084 leakage in gas-fired thermal power plants was 3,255 tCO\u2082 in 2021 and 6,754 tCO\u2082 in 2022.\n(4) 2021 figure restated following the introduction of a new method for calculating GHG emissions from pumping systems.\n(5) Scope 3 categories according to the GHG Protocol.\n(6) 2021 figure restated following the implementation of a new, more precise methodology for calculating indirect emissions related to work performed in the power distribution business.\n(7) 29% of 2022 emissions contribute to the target on absolute additional GHG Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions in 2030 and 43% in 2040 (these percentages cannot be added together).\n(8) GHG emissions from transport of other fuels, raw materials and waste on wheels are 4,032 tCO\u2082 in 2021 and 9,842 tCO\u2082 in 2022.\nThe calculation of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions covers all greenhouse gases (CO\u2082, CH\u2084, N\u2082O, HFCs, PFCs, SF\u2086, NF\u2083), depending on the type of emission source.\n\nIn 2022, Enel\u2019s carbon footprint was 132.9 MtCO\u2082eq (up from 2021 by 6%), broken down as follows:\n\n- **Scope 1**: 53.1 MtCO\u2082eq, representing 40% of total GHG emissions (98.2% of these emissions of CO\u2082, CH\u2084 and N\u2082O result from the combustion of fossil fuels in thermal power plants for electricity generation). Despite the positive impact of the sales of gas-fired plants in Russia and the closure of coal-fired plants in Chile, there was a 3% increase in direct emissions compared to 2021, due to an increase in coal-fired electricity generation in Europe of about 7 TWh (61.5% increase compared to 2021) as a result of the current geopolitical environment and various weather factors, including a reduction in gas availability and an increase in drought, which limited hydroelectric generation in Europe (7 TWh less compared to 2021, a 31% reduction). The percentage of emissions related to EU-ETS is 66.8% of the total Scope 1 (compared to 61.5% in 2021) and the percentage of emissions related to the green tax system in Chile (Sistema de Impuestos Verdes) accounted for 9.0%.\n\n- **Scope 2**: 4.0 MtCO\u2082eq accounting for 3% of the total GHG emissions. Despite the 6% reduction in scope 2 emissions from energy consumption in 2022 compared to 2021 due to a reduction of 9% of the energy consumption in 2022 (from 3.6 TWh to 3.2 TWh), there has been a 7% increase in overall Scope 2 emissions compared to 2021, due to the worsening of the emission factors of the electricity systems in some countries where Enel distributes energy, including Italy, Romania, Chile and Brazil, with a negative impact on indirect emissions related to technical grid losses, which have a weight of 81% in Scope 2.\n\n- **Scope 3**: 75.8 Mt CO\u2082eq accounting for 57% of total GHG emissions. There has been an 8% increase over 2021 as a result of:\n  - a 9% increase in indirect emissions from suppliers (from 13.0 MtCO\u2082eq to 14.2 MtCO\u2082eq), due to a 19% increase in the volumes (measured in euro) of products, services and works ordered, although the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions to volumes ordered improved by 8% due to the circularity approach in procurement (from 968 tCO\u2082eq/\u20ac to 889 tCO\u2082eq/\u20ac);\n  - a 19% increase in indirect emissions from the purchase of energy for sale to end customers (from 24.0 MtCO\u2082eq to 28.4 MtCO\u2082eq), mainly due to the worsening of the emission factors of the electricity systems in which Enel purchases electricity in the wholesale market;\n  - a 52% increase in indirect emissions from the coal mining and transport process for thermal power plants (from 1.2 MtCO\u2082eq to 1.9 MtCO\u2082eq), due to the geopolitical context and the drought period in Europe. In spite of this, indirect emissions related to the process of extracting and transporting gas for thermal power plants and end customers decreased by 16% in 2022 compared to the previous year (from 10.0 MtCO\u2082eq to 8.4 MtCO\u2082eq).\n\nCO\u2082 emissions from biomass combustion, not included in Scope 1, were 114,838 tCO\u2082 in 2022, down 9% from 2021.\nIn 2022, the trend in intensity metrics compared to 2021 was as follows:\n\n| Intensity metric                                      | 2021 (gCO\u2082eq/kWh) | 2022 (gCO\u2082eq/kWh) | Var. % |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|\n| CO\u2082 emissions intensity relating to power generation  | 222                | 225                | 1.4%   |\n| Scope 1 GHG emissions intensity relating to Power Generation | 225                | 229                | 1.8%   |\n| Scope 1 and 3 GHG emissions intensity relating to Integrated Power | 203                | 218                | 74%    |\n| Scope 1 GHG emissions intensity                       | 229                | 233                | 1.7%   |\n\nMetric considered for the 2020-2022 long-term incentive program. Takes into account CO\u2082 emissions relating to power generation, excluding other greenhouse gases. The target set in 2022 of 220 gCO\u2082/kWh was not reached due to the following exogenous factors related to the geopolitical context:\n- non-authorization of the closure of the As Pontes coal-fired plant (Spain), requested in 2019 for 2021;\n- three-month delay in authorizing the closure of the Bocamina coal-fired plant (Chile).\nThe sterilization of these exogenous effects leads to a result of 220 gCO\u2082/kWh.\n\nMetric considered in the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework. It considers Scope 1 emissions relating to power generation (including heat), including CO\u2082, CH\u2084 and N\u2082O, and excluding pumped storage power generation.\n\nThe increase compared to 2021 is mainly due to higher coal production in Europe following the drought period (particularly in Italy) and the geopolitical context.\n\nMetric considered in the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework. It is calculated as the combination of the Group\u2019s direct GHG emissions (Scope 1, including CO\u2082, CH\u2084 and N\u2082O) from power generation and the Group\u2019s indirect GHG emissions (Scope 3) from generation of electricity purchased and sold to end customers, divided by power generation (including heat and excluding pumped storage generation) and purchase of electricity.\n\nIn addition to the exogenous factors already indicated in the previous metrics on direct emissions, the increase compared to 2021 is also due to an increase in indirect emissions relating to the purchase of energy caused by a worsening of the emission factors of the electricity systems in which Enel sells electricity to the end customer.\n\nThe metric considers 100% of direct emissions (Scope 1), including those from power generation (and other emissions in plants), energy distribution, the vehicle fleet and buildings, compared to all power generation (except pumped storage generation). The increase is due to the exogenous factors described above.\n\nThe GHG inventory statements were audited by DNV GL, one of the main certification bodies world-wide, with a reasonable level of certainty for Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions, as limited to the sale of natural gas, and with a limited level of certainty for the other Scope 3 emissions included within the scope of application of the inventory. The audit was conducted according to Standard ISO 4064-3 for the compliance of greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories with the WBCSD/WRI Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol). Furthermore, the calculation of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions has been subject to reasonable assurance by the independent auditing company, KPMG SpA.\n\nFor more details concerning Enel\u2019s carbon footprint, please refer to the 2022 GHG inventory (accessible via the following link: https://www.enel.com/content/dam/enel-com/documenti/investitori/sostenibilita/ghg-inventory-2022.pdf.)\nFinancial, operational and environmental metrics\n\nThe main metrics and financial goals regarding the risks and opportunities connected to climate change, as well as the operational metrics along the entire value chain and the environmental ones, are reported below.\n\n### Financial metrics\n\n|                                | UM 2022 | 2021 | 2022-2021 | %  |\n|--------------------------------|---------|------|-----------|----|\n| Ordinary EBITDA for low-carbon products, services and technologies\\(^{(1)}\\) | billions of euros | 13.9 | 17.3 | 3.4 | -19.6 |\n| % of tot EBITDA                |         | 70.6 | 90.1 | -19 | -    |\n| Capex for low-carbon products, services and technologies\\(^{(2)}\\) | billions of euros | 13.3 | 12.3 | 1.05 | 8.5 |\n| % of total Capex               |         | 92.1 | 93.9 | -1.8 | -    |\n| Revenues from coal plants\\(^{(3)}\\) | billions of euros | 6.5 | 1.9 | 4.6 | -    |\n| % of total Revenues            |         | 4.6  | 2.2  | 2.4 | -    |\n| Revenues from thermal generation\\(^{(3)}\\) | billions of euros | 24.1 | 12.9 | 11.2 | 86.8 |\n| % of total Revenues            |         | 17.2 | 15.1 | 2.1 | -    |\n| Revenues from nuclear plants\\(^{(3)}\\) | billions of euros | 1.6 | 1.4 | 0.2 | 14.3 |\n| % of total Revenues            |         | 1.1  | 1.6  | -0.5 | -    |\n| Debt ratio with sustainability criteria | % | 63  | 55  | 8  | -    |\n| CO\u2082 reference price            | \u20ac/ton   | 78.2 | 53.2 | 24.9 | 46.8 |\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) 2021 figure has been restated to integrate the changes of gas margin due to a change of the control model.\n\n\\(^{(2)}\\) 2021 figure has been restated to consider the inclusion of Latin American retail business in Enel Grids.\n\n\\(^{(3)}\\) 2021 figure has been restated to consider the classification in the count \u201cnet results of discontinued operations\u201d concerning the results from the business activities performed in in Russia (disposed in the fourth quarter of 2022), Romania and Greece as they meet the requirements established in the international accounting principle IFRS 5 for the classification of \u201cdiscontinued operations\u201d.\n\nIn 2022, Enel\u2019s ordinary EBITDA associated with low-carbon emissions services and solutions was 13.9 billion euros, down 19.6% from 2021. The Capex dedicated to low-carbon emission technologies, services and solutions has increased as compared to 2021, reaching 13.3 billion euros, equal to 92.1% of total Capex.\n\nThe percentage share of revenues from coal-fired plants increased, mainly due to the need to compensate for low hydraulicity in Italy and Spain due to adverse weather conditions that severely penalized hydroelectric generation in 2022. Specifically, in 2022, revenues related to coal-fired plants correspond to 4.6% of the Group\u2019s total revenues.\n\nEnel\u2019s strategy of promoting a sustainable financial model has contributed to reaching 63% of debt related to the sustainability objectives.\n\nWith regard to the effects of climate change issues, the Group considers them an implicit element in the application of the methodologies and models used to make estimates in the valuation and/or measurement of certain accounting items. Furthermore, the Group has also taken into account the impacts of climate change in the significant judgments made by management. In this regard, the main items included in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 affected by the use of management\u2019s estimates and judgments concern the impairment of non-financial assets, bonds related to the energy transition, including those for decommissioning and site restoration of certain power generation plants.

Of which second-generation smart meters 25.2 million in 2022 and 23.5 million in 2021.\n\\(^{(5)}\\) KPIs changed from previous year, with focus on publicly owned infrastructure.\n\nThe net electricity generated by Enel in 2022 increased by 5.2 TWh (+2.3%) compared to the value recorded in 2021, mainly due to higher generation from wind sources (+5.5 TWh) mainly in Brazil and North America, a higher contribution from coal-fired plants (+5.9 TWh) in Italy, and higher generation from combined-cycle plants (+2.7 TWh) mainly in Spain and Chile. It should also be noted that the complete deconsolidation of the companies present in Russia took place in 2022, which led to a decrease in net power generated of 11.2 TWh for oil & gas and combined cycle sources only.\nAt the end of December 2022, Group\u2019s total net installed maximum capacity was 84.6 GW, down by 2.5 GW compared to 2021. In addition, Group\u2019s net renewable installed capacity reached 53.6 GW, up by 3.5 GW from 2021, and accounting for 63.3% of total net installed efficient power. During the year, 1.8 GW of new wind capacity was installed, mainly in North America, Brazil and Spain, and 2.6 GW of new solar capacity, mainly in Chile, the United States, Spain and India. In addition, as already mentioned for net power generated, all companies in Russia totaling 5.3 GW were deconsolidated.\nIn 2022, Enel maintained a key role in developing new solutions to accelerate the energy transition process through the development of 760 MW of storage capacity, increasing the current GW of demand response by 51% compared to 2021. The digitalization of the electricity grid, which has been identified as a key enabler able to positively influence climate change through levers such as the integration of more renewable energy or an increase in energy efficiency, continued being a priority for Enel also in 2022. In particular, in 2022 the total number of end users with active smart meters grew 1.9% as compared to the previous year, reaching 45,824,963 in 2022.\n\nEnvironmental metrics\n\nThe following table presents the environmental metrics related to climate change, in addition to the greenhouse gas emissions previously described. Refer to the chapter on \u201cConservation of natural capital\u201d of 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\n| UM | 2022 | 2021 | 2022-2021 | % |\n|----|------|------|-----------|---|\n| Specific withdrawal of freshwater(1) l/kWh eq | 0.23 | 0.25 | -0.02 | -8.0 |\n| Withdrawal of water in water stressed areas(1) (2) % | 19.2 | 23.0 | -3.7 | -16.3 |\n| Generation with water withdrawal in water stressed areas(2) % | 13.3 | 14.0 | -0.70 | -5.0 |\n\n(1) The new target of reducing specific freshwater withdrawals, turning its attention to the most valuable and vulnerable water resource, testifies to Enel\u2019s even more explicit commitment to the protection of natural habitats and the needs of the community. In particular, the objective is in keeping with the reporting and commitment requirements introduced by the new proposed EU EFRAG ESRS-E3 Water and Marine Resources standard, and with the environmental impact (or pressure) priorities indicated for corporate analysis of nature-related risks and opportunities by the international TNFD and SBTN frameworks.\n\n(2) The total value of process and closed-loop cooling water withdrawals for the year 2021 was recalculated following the refinement conducted in 2022 of the way in which water withdrawn for cooling purposes at certain nuclear power plants in Spain was calculated.\nFinancial and operational targets\n\nThe table below shows the main operational objectives included in the 2023-2025 Strategic Plan, which reflect Enel\u2019s role in combating climate change along the entire electricity value chain, in addition to the GHG emission reduction targets described in the previous section.\n\n| Segment of the electricity value chain | Description of the goal | UM 2025 |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------|\n| GENERATION                             | Net installed maximum capacity\\(^{(1)}\\) | GW 79.9 |\n|                                        | -

Sustainable urban development models such as CO2 City Index, Circular City Index, 15Min City Index are also available on the platform.\n\n---\n\n<sup>9</sup> The 2030 target is >20 GW.\n<sup>10</sup> KPI changed from previous year, with a focus on public owned infrastructure.\nClean electrification\nThe energy sector underwent a profound revolution in 2022 that required a twofold acceleration: diversifying and ensuring security of supply at predictable prices, as well as continuing on the path taken in achieving an increasingly sustainable energy mix.\n\nTo reduce the dependence on raw materials, we are promoting greater diversification of the supply chain of key technologies for the transition, including investments to locate photovoltaic panel production in Europe, particularly with the 3SUN Gigafactory in Sicily, whose generation capacity will grow 15 times over current output, reaching 3,000 MW per year in 2024.\n\n**Electrification is the common strategic horizon** toward the progressive decarbonization of the economy, which cannot disregard the efficiency and digitalization of infrastructure and, in particular, distribution networks. As a global player distributing to both rural areas and some of the largest megacities on the planet, we are committed to developing a unique integrated operating model to manage the transformation of the traditional distribution business model and the evolution of electricity grids into resilient, participatory and sustainable platforms.\n\n**Electrification is also the lever** through which customers can participate first-hand in the change taking place, choosing and tapping into the benefits of sustainable solutions that are affordable, innovative, flexible and digital. The change starts precisely with individuals and households who, with the choices they make, can help accelerate the energy transition, not only by purchasing energy generated from renewable sources rather than fossil fuels, but also by becoming \u201cprosumers\u201d, that is, generators of energy as well as consumers, through, for example, the new Renewable Energy Communities (RECs).\n\nElectrification of final energy consumption is confirmed as the optimal solution to decarbonize the economy, make transportation more efficient, reduce environmental impacts and digitalize our homes and cities. It must therefore be understood as an essential tool to achieve the energy transition and shape a sustainable development model. We continue to lead the development of innovative technologies that make the use of clean electricity increasingly affordable and widespread in homes, businesses and government entities, while accelerating the digitalization of services for greater efficiency in the use of energy itself.\n\nIn addition, 2022 saw the birth of the Enel X Way Business Line, fully dedicated to electric mobility and in particular the expansion of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, with the goal of meeting the rapidly growing market, the development of advanced charging technologies and flexible solutions aimed at improving customer experience and supporting the electrification of transportation for consumers, businesses and cities.\nCommitments to electrification: Enel\u2019s Energy Compact\n\nEnel is among the companies that participated from the beginning in the United Nations High-Level Dialogue on Energy (HLDE), which led to the launch of a global roadmap to set specific goals in accelerating the energy transition and ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy systems for all by 2030.\n\nIn order to monitor the overall progress of the more than 200 Energy Compacts launched to date and counting over USD 600 billion in investments, in 2022 the UN launched the first data collection process to monitor the progress of SDG 7 commitments, the results of which were published in the Annual Progress Report 2022. Commitments to date have resulted in USD 46 billion of investment, providing better access to electricity and clean, sustainable cooking for 6 million and 14 million people worldwide respectively; 88 GW of renewable energy capacity has been installed and 2,450 GWh of electricity will be saved between 2021 and 2022 through energy efficiency.\n\nEnel\u2019s commitment includes several objectives underpinning the electrification strategy, such as increasing renewable capacity and demand response, reducing GHG emissions in line with the 1.5 \u00b0C scenario (certified by SBTi), installing new electric vehicle charging points, and committing to achieving new connections in rural and suburban areas in the countries where the Group maintains a presence. The commitments reported in the Energy Compact are in line with the Strategic and Sustainability Plans so as to ensure transparency and traceability in the Group\u2019s path to clean electrification.\n\nThe Group\u2019s commitment is complemented by:\n\n- **the Energy Compact for the electrification of Sardinia**, which aims to phase out coal, increase generation from renewable sources, and electrify final demand;\n- **Enel Chile Energy Compact**, promoted in collaboration with the Universidad del Desarrollo and the Government of the Santiago Metropolitan Region, with the goal of electrifying the entire bus fleet by 2030. In addition, efforts will be made to accelerate the replacement of wood-burning stoves in residential, commercial and government buildings with electric heating systems, from the 10,000 substitutions made by Enel to date, to over 60,000 planned by 2030.\nSardinia: the perfect island for a sustainable model\n\nThanks to the many renewable resources on the island, Sardinia can act as a driving force for electrification and sustainability.\n\nSardinia has all the characteristics to become a green model for the energy transition of the near future. An ambitious goal to which our Group intends to contribute, powering the entire Mediterranean island with the abundant renewable resources available there. Sardinia has geographical, economic and demographic characteristics that differentiate it from other Italian regions: its insularity has limited the development of energy infrastructure, to the extent that it has been excluded from methanization. On the other hand, natural resources such as wind, water and solar energy are present in abundance due to the advantageous location, making it possible to create plants capable of producing large amounts of energy.\n\nIn line with the Enel Group\u2019s nationwide commitment, the sustainability goal can only be to reduce to zero the use of both coal and natural gas, starting with the promotion of alternative, green solutions. When completed, the electrification process will at the same time promote sustainable tourism through the spread of environmentally friendly vehicles by land and sea as fossil-fueled means of transportation gradually disappear. In this regard, Enel X Way has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Region of Sardinia that entails the installation of 1,200 charging points in the island\u2019s urban centers to support the energy transition.\n\nBased on estimates of Sardinia\u2019s energy needs, it is predicted that by 2040 it will be possible to reduce the use of coal and natural gas to zero, using only renewable sources. Most of the installations will be photovoltaic and wind plants: together with the existing hydroelectric power plants and storage systems, therefore, the aim is to have an energy mix that can guarantee continuity in the availability of electricity. With the acceleration of enabling regulatory factors and authorization time lines, within a few years this scenario will bring concrete benefits for people\u2019s health and especially the environment, making Sardinia an energy benchmark model for green development, potentially replicable elsewhere. The public will also be the main players in this transaction through a model of distributed generation on the ground and also active through participation in energy communities.\n\nThanks to the creation of partnerships and agreements, in which the Enel Group will play an active role, the state-of-the-art facilities and innovative infrastructure will also allow for significant development of the island from an economic point of view, with the creation of new jobs and the arrival of investments.\nDespite the difficult geopolitical context and the energy crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine, the Group generated around 124 TWh of electricity from renewable sources in 2022 (119 TWh in 2021), of which more than 50% (66 TWh) from wind and solar power. We installed and commissioned new capacity of 5,223 MW, up from 5,120 MW in 2021, thanks to more than 80 plants divided between solar and wind power. In addition, we reached 387 MW of battery storage, an element of flexibility that is becoming increasingly strategic in the energy transition process we are currently experiencing. In 2022, the process of shutting down coal-fired power plants proceeded. In September, we shut down the last coal-fired unit at the Bocamina power plant, decommissioning the entire coal-fired fleet 18 years ahead of the 2040 targets set in Chile\u2019s National Decarbonization Plan. In Spain, the Teruel thermal power plant was also dismantled with the demolition of the cooling towers. For more details, please refer to the chapters \u201cZero emissions ambition\u201d and \u201cOur commitment to a just transition: leaving no one behind\u201d in this Report.\n\nAs of the end of December 2022, the Group\u2019s net renewable installed maximum capacity reached 53.6 GW, up by 3.5 GW from 2021, and corresponding to 63.3% of the total net installed maximum capacity. This achievement enabled Enel to meet the target set in all those financial instruments related to attaining a renewable installed capacity percentage in excess of or equal to 60%. For further details, please refer to the chapter \u201cSustainability-linked finance according to Enel\u201d in this document.\n\nTHE SUSTAINABLE SITE AND PLANT MODEL\n\nThe Design and Site models of the sustainable plant were created to integrate sustainability into the business along the value chain (phases of Business Development, Engineering & Construction, Operation & Maintenance, Repurposing) and are based on the principles of Creating Shared Value (CSV) to forge synergies between the needs of the business and those of the region. These are constantly evolving pillars centered on best practices and procedures that aim to mitigate the impact of our plants on the local areas, increase and foster collaboration with communities and generate efficiency by promoting and applying the principles of CSV, circular economy and innovation, based on a deep knowledge of the context in which we operate. The use of local labor for construction activities and actions taken to maximize the recycling of waste produced and reduce water consumption are examples of the application of the models. Specifically, the sustainable Design and Site pillar applies to the construction phase of a plant up to its completion, while the Sustainable plant pillar applies to the Operation & Maintenance (O&M) phase, i.e. the plant\u2019s operations and generation activities. In 2022, the sustainable Design and Site model was applied at all construction sites, and the sustainable practices under the model were adopted at 75% at the hydroelectric, geothermal and thermal sites and 95% at the remaining renewable sites.\n\nAccording to studies by the IEA (International Energy Agency), the pace of growth of renewables must increase year after year. They must support the electrification of sectors such as private transport or domestic heating, which until now have been almost entirely based on fossil fuels. We have therefore set ourselves the ambitious goal of generating 100% energy from renewable sources by 2040.\n\nTo achieve this goal, we must also invest in the supply chain. In April 2022, Enel Green Power signed a subsidized loan agreement with the European Union for the transformation of 3SUN into a solar panel Gigafactory in Catania, Sicily, Italy, which will become Europe\u2019s largest factory for the production of high-performance double-sided photovoltaic modules. The Gigafactory will help raise efficiency standards in the market while improving the reliability and sustainability of the panels manufactured, and will make an important contribution to the growth and maintenance of a solar power industry in Europe.\n\n---\n\n(1) 124 TWh equals about 50% of total net production and excludes generation from managed capacity of 11 TWh in 2022.\n(2) Including managed renewable capacity and BESS in 2022, 59 GW of installed capacity or 66% of total capacity was reached.\n(3) From the calculation of the percentage of renewable installed capacity for the purpose of the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework, 531.1 MW of purchased capacity from power plants acquired by the Group was excluded in accordance with the contractual documentation of the individual instruments.\n3SUN Gigafactory: the future of energy takes shape in Catania\n\nA hub of technological excellence for energy self-dependence\n\nOur 3SUN photovoltaic module factory in Catania, established in 2010 and continuously growing, is preparing to become a true Gigafactory. By July 2024, 3SUN will see its annual generation capacity grow 15-fold, from the current 200 MW to 3 GW, becoming the largest photovoltaic panel factory in Europe. We expect an investment of around 600 million euros, of which almost 118 million euros from the EU Innovation Fund, which identified TANGO, i.e. iTaliAN Giga factOry, as one of the seven initiatives selected. The project has been included in funding requests for Italy\u2019s National Recovery and Resilience Plan and, if awarded, the total project funding could reach up to 188 million euros.\n\nThe selection process to recruit more than 500 secondary school graduates for technical and operational positions in the areas of generation, maintenance, auxiliary services, product quality and plant management has just begun. In 2022, 50 graduates were hired and the process to select another 100 is currently underway.\n\nWith these new recruits, 3SUN\u2019s team, which already includes more than 200 resources, will be significantly expanded to around 900 employees in total. Not only will the Gigafactory increase direct employment, it will also generate a total of 1,000 indirect jobs, including current ones, by 2024.\nDigitalization of grids\n\nElectricity distribution grids by country and region\n\n| km | High voltage | Medium voltage | Low voltage |\n|----|--------------|----------------|-------------|\n| 2,024,038 | 40,566 | 717,992 | 1,265,480 |\n| 2% | 35% | 63% |\n| Europe and North America | 5% | 27% | 68% |\n| Iberia | 6% | 36% | 58% |\n| Italy | - | 31% | 69% |\n| Latin America | 4% | 50% | 46% |\n\n(1) In Italy there are almost 20 km of high-voltage grid.\n\nThe grid is not an infrastructure for its own sake, but enables the interconnection of the different players in the energy market. Supply electricity is reliable only if it is guaranteed by a grid that, through innovation and digitalization, is capable of ensuring the completion of the energy transition through the electrification of uses. Aware of its strategic role, we now have one of the most innovative and digitalized electricity infrastructures in the world. We also launched an action plan called Grid Futurability\u00ae, a comprehensive, customer-oriented industrial approach aimed at renewing, strengthening and expanding the Enel Group\u2019s grids in the coming years. Our aim is to provide a more resilient, participative and sustainable grid, one which can anticipate, through an investment roadmap, the needs of stakeholders and harness innovative technological developments to meet them.\n\nThe grid is key to achieving decarbonization targets. In 2022, we presented the Net-Zero strategy for grid activity to counter direct emissions inherent in the infrastructure, acting on digitization, remote operations, the use of electric vehicles for work, measures to protect biodiversity and reducing technical grid losses. In addition, we are engaging suppliers, equipment manufacturers and construction companies in our supply chain to reduce indirect emissions and implement more sustainable processes and network components, such as SF\u2086-free switchgear, vegetable oils for transformers and environmentally friendly or standard cables for sustainable construction sites.\n\nOver the past year, we have entirely rethought the value chain by applying the concept of Sustainable by Design, redesigning the production and end-of-life management processes of grid assets with the aim of decreasing raw material consumption, maximizing economic value and reducing environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\n\nA Sustainable Reference Model tool has been developed which, integrated into our digitalized systems, makes it possible to monitor the number and type of solutions implemented at all active or opening sites and to measure their impacts, along four lines: decarbonization, social, environmental and circularity. The score associated with each solution makes it possible both to identify the most virtuous sites (ex post evaluation) and to carry out simulations (ex ante evaluation) to facilitate the choice of solutions to be implemented.\n\nIn order to make the value chain circular, we also defined Grid Mining & Zero Waste strategies, to review the end-of-life management processes of grid assets in a more sustainable way and identify New Life Cycle practices (recycling and reuse of materials at the end of their life). In this regard, in order to ensure complete tracking of the materials contained in grid assets, we have developed the \u201cDigital Product Passport\u201d in our systems, which enables us to monitor any materials considered critical, for which it might be useful to evaluate an alternative, but also to define ex ante the end-of-life reuse scenarios. Having an integrated and digitalized tracking system along the entire value chain is the driving force toward the ambition to open our \u201cmine\u201d (grid mining) to the outside world as well.\nmaking it available to other companies or different sectors in order to involve their respective production chains and feed new markets for raw and secondary materials, promoting the development of the area and the saving of virgin materials, and creating new job opportunities related to waste material recovery initiatives while minimizing environmental impacts. More details can be found in the chapter \u201cCircular economy\u201d in this document.\n\nAchieving such ambitious goals necessarily requires joint multi-stakeholder action, involving suppliers, partners, competitors, industry grids, etc. In the spirit of Open Power, we have:\n\n- founded the Open Power Grids Association, which aims to share and develop grid-related technologies and methodologies with industry stakeholders in order to accelerate the adoption of safer, more efficient and sustainable solutions for faster achievement of the requirements towards the zero-emission ambition;\n- launched specific challenges on the crowd sourcing platform openinnovability.com, covering, among other aspects:\n  - a new concept for the design of the primary and secondary substations, as well as for the smart meter installed in end user homes, whose development and large-scale adoption will lead to a significant reduction in environmental impacts;\n  - the identification of low-emission gensets to be used for emergency management or in all cases where they are needed for the operation and maintenance of the grid;\n  - alternative technologies for the construction phase of traditionally concrete assets such as 3D printing.\n\nIn addition, tests were conducted on a new design of distribution infrastructure supports using alternative materials to traditional cement with a high clinker content with a high impact in terms of avoided emissions of up to 80%. Meanwhile, by way of application of the grid mining strategy, experiments continue on the reuse of composite material from wind turbines for the production of certain grid components and on the identification of solutions for the reuse of wood waste from logging near overhead lines.\n\nIn 2021 Gridspertise was established, a new industrial and commercial entity that offers innovative, flexible, sustainable and integrated solutions to electricity and distribution operators (DSOs), presenting itself to the market as a reliable partner to boost the digital transformation of power grids across the industry ecosystem as part of the energy transition. The priority areas for action are:\n\n- meter and grid edge digitalization, focused on increasing customer engagement and stakeholder participation through smart meters and grid edge technologies that also enable engagement in electricity prosumer markets;\n- digitalization of grid infrastructure, aimed at increasing the intelligence and flexibility of power grids to accelerate full-scale digitalization, increasing efficiency, reliability and service quality and supporting DSOs to manage the challenges facing network operations;\n- digitalization of field operations, to increase operational efficiency thanks to innovative solutions for planning and operational processes and, at the same time, to increase the safety of internal and external operators in the field.\n\nIn October 2022, an agreement was signed for the sale of 50% of Gridspertise Srl to the international private equity fund CVC Capital Partners Fund VIII (CVC).\n\nRecord distributed renewable generation capacity with 5.6 GW connected to its grids in 2022\n\nBy 2022, we will have connected to our grids a record nearly 5.6 GW of distributed renewable generation capacity equivalent to more than 400 thousand producers and prosumers worldwide, including more than 300 thousand in Europe and the rest in Latin America. This gives us a global cumulative capacity of 65.7 GW, equivalent to approximately 1.4 million producers and prosumers. These results were achieved thanks to the increasing capacity to accommodate distributed renewable generation (hosting capacity) and the high level of digitalization of the distribution networks operated by Enel.\n\nFor further details, see section \u201cRenewable energies\u201d in this chapter.\n\n---\n\n(1) Including about 300 MW corresponding to Enel Goi\u00e1s in Brazil, sold at the end of December 2022.\n(2) Including about 35,000 producers and prosumers added by Enel Goi\u00e1s in Brazil, sold at the end of December 2022.\n(3) Including about 700 MW corresponding to Enel Goi\u00e1s in Brazil, sold at the end of December 2022.\nElectrification of uses\n\n| 3-3 | EU3 | DMA EU (former EU23) |\n\n321.1 TWh\nELECTRICITY SOLD\n309.4 TW in 2021 +3.8%\n\n212\nCOMPLAINTS (NO./10 THOUSAND CUSTOMERS)\n\n22.6 thousand\nOWNED PUBLIC CHARGING POINTS\n18.1 thousand in 2021 +24.9%\n\n45.8 million\nEND USERS WITH ACTIVE SMART METERS\n45.2 million in 2021 +1.5%\n\nThe final number of energy and gas customers was close to 67 million in 2022, down slightly from 2021, while energy sales amounted to 321.1 TWh in 2022 (309.4 TWh in 2021).\n\nCustomer centricity\n\nThe leadership of a company like Enel necessarily passes through customer care and attention to quality service, aspects that refer not only to the supply of electricity and/or natural gas, but also and above all to the intangible aspects of the service perceived by the customer.\n\nWe aim to maximize value for customers on a daily basis:\n\u2022 through a robust business model that focuses on the continuous improvement of efficiency, effectiveness and resilience in process management (activation of new services, billing, payments and credit, customer focus) and digitalization.\n\u2022 making them more aware with offers geared towards increasing awareness of their consumption, different time slots, rewards for reducing consumption compared to the past, clear and simple communication;\n\u2022 proactively managing their needs;\n\u2022 accompanying them towards electrification.\nListen actively\n\nDeeply understanding our customers and treating everyone with respect and kindness, taking their needs to heart and solving them with concrete solutions. We have consolidated activities focused on measuring and monitoring customer satisfaction and happiness, as well as analyzing feedback to integrate the customer\u2019s point of view into the overall management of business processes.\n\nMake life easier\n\nAdopt an understandable language and always keep promises, respecting your customers\u2019 time and always working efficiently.\n\nIn order to simplify the experience of our customers, in 2022 we developed a specific platform to standardize and optimize internal processes, aware that in order to be able to offer efficient solutions to our customers, we must first simplify ourselves, also by using comprehensible language, free of technicalities. To this end, we launched the Plain Language project, aimed at simplifying the communication language used through the different channels of customer interaction. In Spain, the new global app was launched to offer a higher level of customer experience. These actions have improved the efficiency of operations with a major impact on reducing complaints and optimizing operating costs.\n\nBuild the future\n\nAccelerating electrification, anticipating customers\u2019 needs and offering sustainable solutions for families and businesses, accompanying them with honesty and determination to earn their trust.\n\nData-driven decision-making, an agile approach to design, customer centricity based on inclusiveness and accessibility, digitalization and simplification are the levers to generate value for customers and the Company.\n\nOver the past few years, new payment methods have been introduced, digital channels have been strengthened, and customers have been provided with tools to control their consumption and improve energy efficiency, with a view to encouraging their participation in the Net-Zero transition.\n\nEnel also focuses on the future, through open and sustainable innovation partnering with start-ups to engage customers towards a digital profile, standardize processes, personalize the service and ensure transparent and reliable information. We involve customers in the testing and co-design of new services, including through neuroscience and biofeedback tests in collaboration with universities and research centers.\n\nWe put customers at the center of the energy transition, offering a comprehensive product portfolio, commodity and beyond commodity, and a unique customer experience that ensures no one is left behind.\n\nCustomer satisfaction\n\n\u201cOn a scale of 0 to 10, would you recommend Enel to your family and friends?\u201d This simple question is the basis for the Net Promoter Score (NPS), which allows us to measure customer satisfaction globally through simple and immediately understandable data. It is calculated, in a range from -100 to +100, as the percentage of \u201cpromoters\u201d (score of 9 or 10 out of 10) minus the percentage of \u201cdetractors\u201d (score between 0 and 6 out of 10). Customers are interviewed by e-mail twice a year to maximize responses and to monitor trends over time.\n\nWe complement NPS, monitoring transactional aspects aimed at detecting overall satisfaction during some of the most sensitive phases of the customer experience (such as activation completion, contact center interaction, bill delivery, etc.). We survey our customers by e-mail to measure their level of Customer Satisfaction (CSAT), using an international standard that is based on the question \u201cOn a scale of 1 to 5, how satisfied are you with the \u2018moment of truth\u2019?\u201d The total is calculated as the average of all responses received. During 2022, CSAT survey coverage was\n\n---\n\n(4) Significant events in the relationship between customer and Company (e.g. completion of activation, interaction with the contact center, delivery of the utility bill, etc.) that determine the customer\u2019s opinion and evaluation of the service.\ncompleted in Italy and Spain (30 \u201cmoments of truth\u201d per Country), is ongoing in Brazil (8 \u201cmoments of truth\u201d) and is about to be launched in 2023 in most other markets. Thanks to the continuous feedback from the customer base, the dedicated Customer Happiness team and the constant monitoring of happiness and satisfaction values and insights \u2013 now integrated into the operational processes of Activation, Billing, Credit and Collection and Customer Care \u2013 2022 saw Enel achieve a solid increase in Global Net Promoter Score (weighted average of all NPS values at country level), from -2.8 in December 2021 to +5.6 in December 2022.\n\nComplaints management\n\nIn 2022, guidelines on the complaints monitoring and classification process were implemented in all countries where we operate, in order to maximize service quality and increase customer satisfaction, in accordance with applicable laws, regulations and governance rules. Our aim is the convergence of the current processes towards a common, effective and efficient model, through continuous performance monitoring and the development of internal benchmarking, aimed at highlighting a non-conformity on an existing product/service/functionality, which cannot be resolved immediately (First Contact Resolution) and therefore requires further work by the Complaints Back Office. In addition, we have worked to standardize the monitoring and quality control of complaints management with homogeneous operating methods to make the performance of the Group\u2019s different countries of presence comparable, also thanks to the creation of a global platform that enables monitoring of indicators and trends while at the same time ensuring the correct classification of complaints handled.\n\nFocus on vulnerable groups\n\nWe want to remain attentive to the needs of citizens, improving and maintaining access to electricity in the most disadvantaged areas and among the poorest populations. All the countries in which the Group operates in fact provide forms of support, often linked to state initiatives, which make it easier for certain sections of the population to pay electricity and gas bills, thus allowing equal access to energy. For further details on initiatives dedicated to vulnerable customers, please refer to the \u201cValue for Disability\u201d project in the \u201cManaging human rights\u201d chapter of this Report.\n\nTransparent relations\n\nIn line with its commitments to mitigate the effects of climate change, our Group has intensified the process of digitalizing customer relations. During 2022, digital services were further expanded, including the promotion of digital bills and payment channels with the possibility of flexible installment plans. The emphasis was placed on developing and marketing a digital solution with simpler and more transparent bills. In 2022, thanks to e-billing, 30% of bills globally was sent electronically. This not only reduces the costs of paper, printing and delivery of traditional bills, but also the CO\u2082 emissions associated with all these activities.\n\nBy leveraging state-of-the-art technology standards, telephone customer service in Chile, Colombia and Peru was standardized. Thanks to a global control center, it is possible to monitor the flow of calls and manage their routing to available operators in order to minimize waiting time for our customers. In addition, the operating methods, defined at global level, tend to the highest quality standards, standardizing the \u201ctone of voice\u201d and style of handling customer issues. Thanks to a data-driven approach and continuous benchmarking of best practices, both from energy companies and other leading digital industries, the following three\n\u201cCustomer Centric Behaviors\u201d have been defined in order to offer our customers simple, innovative, sustainable, fast and effective solutions, through a clear language that is accessible to everyone:\n\n- listen actively,\n- make life easier,\n- build the future.\n\nThe focus on Customer Happiness takes shape when we call into question all those emotional factors that, parallel to the more rational ones related to the choice and \u201cconfirmation\u201d of a brand, are built on a more human interaction in relation to the brand and its advocates. We want to exceed our client\u2019s expectations by optimally balancing the ratio of costs incurred against benefits received, thereby increasing the likelihood of a more stable and lasting relationship. Enhancing the perception of our work with an effective and efficient service leads to the building of a long-lasting relationship. Not only that: by focusing our energies on Customer Happiness we also optimize satisfaction, provide more stability in securing the Company\u2019s market share and give more support to pricing policies.\n\nEnel complies with current customer privacy regulations in all the countries where it operates. We also strive to monitor third-party companies that may be in a position to use the personal data of customers. To this end, dedicated clauses are included in contracts with partners who use personal data to carry out specific activities, for example sales services or customer happiness surveys. Customer data is an expression of the individual\u2019s personality and identity, and must therefore be treated with due caution and guarantees. Enel considers personal data to be a shared and corporate asset at the same time. For this reason, we have appointed a Data Protection Officer who aims to guarantee full respect for the privacy of all the individuals with whom we interact. For further details, see the \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter of this document.\n\nEnergy-saving commercial offers, products and services\n\nAs a result of rising energy prices, the topic of energy saving has become even more important in 2022, and in all countries where we operate, efforts have been stepped up to make energy efficiency solutions available that can guarantee customers savings in terms of both consumption and CO\u2082 emissions. From household appliances to smart home solutions, from home services to heating and air-conditioning systems, from solar-powered systems to charging infrastructures for electric cars, solutions have been developed to help save energy, time and money. Among the proposed solutions we find Homix, the smart home solution to manage temperature, lighting and security easily and intelligently in the home, optimizing consumption on the basis of the habits and needs of the family. Induction hobs that replace traditional gas cookers and enable the cooking of food in less time, with almost twice the energy efficiency of gas cookers, greater safety and significant CO\u2082 savings. Enel X Sun Plug&Play is the innovative flat photovoltaic system that can be installed on a balcony or on the fa\u00e7ade of a building at a window, allowing the energy generated by the sun to contribute to the home\u2019s energy needs, saving up to 20% on energy bills. Heat pumps use thermal energy from air or water for heating and cooling and are up to four times more energy efficient than the best boilers, saving around 40% on utility bills. Another product that is of great importance for energy freedom is rooftop photovoltaics with a storage system: it harnesses solar energy to generate electricity, saving money on electricity bills through self-consumption and energy storage. In fact, the system stores in batteries the excess electricity generated by the photovoltaic system during the day, making it available during the night when the system is not generating, thus significantly reducing energy drawn from the grid and consequently costs on the bill.\n\nIn 2022, Enel X installed a total of about 73,000 Smart Home products and more than 5,000 photovoltaic products that contribute to energy savings and efficiency.\nFrom need to solution, customer-driven change\n\nEncouraging the active participation of customers in the transition, the development of new services, a better understanding of their consumption and greater control over it is the basis of our daily commitment. We aim to develop innovative technologies that make the use of clean electricity increasingly affordable and widespread in homes (B2C), businesses (B2B) and the public sector (B2G), while accelerating the digitalization of services for more efficient energy use.\n\nBusinesses: B2B (Business To Business)\n\nOur ambition is to be able to become a partner to companies and guide them towards the use of customized integrated solutions, starting from a simple consultancy to the implementation of articulated solutions such as self-generation of electricity, installation of trigeneration plants, products and services for energy efficiency and energy demand management solutions. We aim to optimize costs and consumption, to create value where it was not possible before, taking advantage of technological evolution and making businesses increasingly sustainable.\n\nAmong the most notable achievements in 2022 is the reaffirmation of our leadership in flexibility services, i.e. the service that allows companies to reduce their energy consumption temporarily or provide their own on-site generation in order to offer this flexibility to serve grid stabilization (balancing electricity supply and demand) and receive remuneration in return. In fact, we managed 8.5 GW of capacity worldwide on behalf of our customers. We have also installed 87.8 MW of power solutions that have enabled our customers to self-generate renewable energy.\n\nDISTRIBUTED GENERATION\n\nEnel X\u2019s largest distributed solar generation project in the world: Ita\u00fa Unibanco\n\nIn August 2022, we signed an agreement with Ita\u00fa Unibanco, one of the largest private banks in Latin America, for the installation of 46 photovoltaic plants with a total capacity of 54.7 MWp. It is one of Enel X\u2019s largest distributed solar power generation contracts in the world and will be used to power 1,557 branches in 14 locations in Brazil (representing about 80% of the Brazilian bank\u2019s branches) with renewable energy. Enel X will facilitate Ita\u00fa\u2019s energy transition in support of its commitment to become a zero-emission entity by 2050. Ita\u00fa Unibanco is present in 8 countries besides Brazil, with 90,000 employees and 60 million customers. It operates mainly in Brazil, but its international presence allows it to provide high-quality services to local and Brazilian clients abroad.\nIn addition, the implementation of the Utility Bill Management (UBM) platform will enable it to:\n\n- digitalize the management of corporate payments;\n- organize information on service providers\u2019 accounts;\n- monitor the energy and water consumption of the 1,557 business units;\n- monitor sustainability indicators.\n\nEnel X\u2019s distributed energy system will enable Ita\u00fa to generate its own energy with significant cost savings on its bills and more efficient management of the company\u2019s accounts. In addition, the use of sustainable energy will avoid the emission of 10,000 tons per year of CO\u2082, thus embarking on the road to carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nTELEMEDICINE\n\nSmart Axistance e-Well\n\n\u201cEnel X\u2019s mission is \u2018to discover, nurture, fuse and perfect cutting-edge technologies and services in order to improve and make people\u2019s lives easier\u2019. This is why Enel X intends to meet customers\u2019 new needs related to the world of Health: to have the medical advice they need anywhere, any time and in any condition. Platforms and services, in turn, must comply with the principles of sustainability and circular economy.\u201d\n\nSmart Axistance e-Well is the innovative application that accompanies users on a path to personal well-being and aims to help improve lifestyle and monitor key health risk factors. The use of the e-Well application is extremely simple despite encompassing years of medical-scientific research and cutting-edge technology: simply download the app, fill in a questionnaire on your initial health status and perform the check-up, either at Policlinico Gemelli or completely digitally. Thus commences a year-long wellness journey.\n\nThe distinctive elements that characterize the innovativeness and sustainability of Smart Axistance e-Well can be summarized in five areas:\n\n- **Customization.** The Smart Axistance e-Well wellness program is fully customized to suit people\u2019s needs, characteristics and lifestyles and includes a nutrition program and a physical activity program.\n- **Medical partnership.** It is made possible by the combination of Enel X\u2019s technology and the medical expertise of the doctors at Policlinico Gemelli, Italy\u2019s leading hospital according to Newsweek\u2019s World\u2019s Best Hospitals 2022 ranking and an internationally renowned medical-biological research center.\n- **Wellness areas.** It considers the main health risk factors, recognized by the American Heart Association, such as physical activity performed, diet followed, sleep, smoking and mood.\n- **Video consultations.** In the Smart Axistance e-Well program, the relationship between doctor and user takes place via video consultations: it is therefore digital, without geographical barriers.\n- **Innovative technologies.** Smart Axistance e-Well is an application developed on the basis of the most advanced technologies and integrates its functionalities with smartbands for monitoring vital parameters.\nThe public sector: B2G (Business To Government)\n\nThe offerings for the public sector aim to make cities \u201csmart\u201d environments, accompanying them on a path of electrification and digitalization, through the integration of solutions aimed at efficiency and the improvement of services in favor of the public\u2019s well-being and the reduction of polluting emissions.\n\nWe accompany small and large municipalities in their transition towards an innovative smart city model, providing them with a portfolio of solutions aimed at improving the integration and interconnection of their services. For example, using state-of-the-art technology, we aim to transform street lighting into a smart, multifunctional and efficient infrastructure (sensors, cameras and electric car charging points) for the safety and convenience of the public and at all times connected with a digital platform for remote, real-time management and monitoring.\n\nIn addition, we promote solutions for the electrification of urban transport and public building efficiency that optimize the energy performance of buildings while opening up the possibility of active participation in the flexibility services already described for B2B customers.\n\nWith a view to facilitating the control and management of the solutions active in their region, we provide government authorities with a single digital access point, Enel X YoUrban, which allows them to monitor the status of their infrastructures, visualize performance indicators and stay connected and informed on the new technological possibilities offered by the market.\n\nDuring 2022, we achieved major milestones in the efficiency of public lighting by installing more than 3 million LED lighting points and operated more than 5,321 electric buses worldwide.\n\nELECTRIC BUSES\n\nThe Enel X TransMilenio Project\n\n\u201cWe are proud to be part of this project because, by providing the charging infrastructure for the new bus fleet, we can contribute to the development of electric mobility, the energy transition and the transformation of Bogot\u00e1 into a smart and sustainable city.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, we completed the construction of the fifth electroterminal in Colombia, Fontib\u00f3n \u2013 Escritorio, one of the largest in South America. It will serve 172 electric buses thanks to an electrical infrastructure with an installed capacity of 13.6 MW, and boasts more than 80 stations dual plug charging stations of 150 kW each provided by Enel X Way, another Group company whose mission is focused totally on electric mobility.\n\nThe project was developed within the framework of the concession contract signed with TransMilenio SA, the public transport administration body of Bogot\u00e1\u2019s Capital District, and is intended for the public transport operator Mueve Fontib\u00f3n SAS.\n\nIt is the first large-scale electric mobility infrastructure in Colombia, contributing to the decarbonization and the technological and sustainable development of the capital Bogot\u00e1. Bogot\u00e1\u2019s e-buses have enabled the municipal administration to reduce emissions by 600 tons of CO\u2082 per year. Six electroterminals capable of charging buses in a few hours have already been opened throughout the city in Fontib\u00f3n Escritorio, Fontib\u00f3n Refugio, Fontib\u00f3n Aeropuerto, Suba Las Mercedes and Usme, serving 878 electric buses with 412 smart chargers. In addition to the partners already mentioned, there is the bus manufacturer, BYD.\nSMART AND EFFICIENT PUBLIC BUILDINGS\n\nThe Mateu Orfila Hospital\n\n\u201cEndesa X wants to be the energy partner of cities to help them achieve their decarbonization goals. We put all our knowledge of the energy world at their disposal to realize cleaner cities that save as much energy as possible. The Mateu Orfila Hospital is an example of this.\u201d\n\nEndesa X built the first car park of a hospital covered by photovoltaic panels in the Balearic Islands (Spain). The project enabled the Mateu Orfila Hospital to have up to 976 kW peak power (kWp) in 100% renewable energy for its own consumption. The installation, located in the hospital\u2019s 15,000 m\u00b2 car park, will help to reduce the hospital\u2019s carbon footprint significantly, supplying 20% of the electricity consumed by the hospital and saving around \u20ac160,000 per year, according to the Balearic Islands government\u2019s Energy Transition Department.\n\nResidential customers: B2C (Business To Consumer)\n\nOur goal is to simplify and improve people\u2019s lives, through integrated solutions that combine convenience and efficiency and offer greater insight into consumption and consequently greater control over it, to enable residential customers to electrify their usage and participate in the change taking place, with an awareness of how their individual choices contribute to the transition. Our solutions therefore accompany customers along this path, guaranteeing greater independence in the supply of energy through easily accessible distributed energy products such as Enel X Sun Plug&Play rooftop and balcony photovoltaic panels. Alternatively, they can optimize their consumption, such as through the Homix smart thermostat, which optimally manages home heating, memorizing the family\u2019s habits and automating it according to different needs, also managing lighting and home security in an intelligent way, thus transforming it into a true smart ecosystem that saves consumption and respects the environment.\n\nA commitment that resulted in the sale of 73,000 Smart Home products and over 5,000 photovoltaic products within a consumer customer portfolio that exceeded 63 million units globally.\n#UnPannelloInPi\u00f9: photovoltaics for installation on apartment buildings can make a difference\n\nA fund-raising campaign promoted by Legambiente together with Enel X dedicated to the fight against energy poverty and the social and economic impact that solar home panels can have.\n\n\"With the #UnPannelloInPi\u00f9 campaign that sees us alongside Enel X, we want to offer a concrete response to high utility bills and social inequalities. It is important to give the public a structural welfare solution with tools for self-generation from renewable energy that can bring lasting benefits, both from an economic and social point of view as well as from an environmental protection point of view, while also combating energy poverty that already affected more than 2.2 million households in our country before the pandemic.\"\n\nHow can we fight high energy prices and reduce the cost of utility bills? One of the simplest and most practical solutions comes in the form of photovoltaic installation on apartment buildings: cheap, easy to install and activate, and able to cover the consumption of certain household appliances, such as the television, refrigerator or air conditioner, with bill savings of up to 20%, while also generating environmental benefits. In fact, this technology makes it possible to generate clean energy, contributing to combating the climate crisis and reducing atmospheric pollution: it avoids the emission into the atmosphere of 103 kg of CO\u2082 per year, equivalent to the amount of CO\u2082 absorbed by about 6 trees.\n\nFor these reasons, in June 2022 Legambiente, together with Enel X, launched the fund-raising campaign \"#UnPannelloInPi\u00f9\" with the dual objective of helping families in need and informing and raising awareness of the great potential of this type of panel. With a simple donation on the Legambiente website, individuals, associations and businesses were able to contribute to the purchase of photovoltaic panels for installation on apartment buildings for families in economic and social difficulty. The crowdfunding initiative was accompanied by a touring campaign that made stops in nine Italian cities from June 8 to 27, 2022. These were Naples, Brindisi, Palermo, Rome, Cagliari, Florence, Turin, Milan, and Bologna. The event included a series of events aimed at raising awareness of all the tools that exist today to reduce utility bills, including the role of solar photovoltaics in the fight against energy poverty, as well as savings and efficiency, energy communities, social bonuses and the sharing economy.\n\nIn substance we are dealing with an inexpensive, easy-to-install and easy-to-activate solution that facilitates access to solar technology by making it truly affordable for everyone. Since its launch, the campaign has raised more than 80,000 euros, which will be used to donate apartment photovoltaic systems to families in a state of energy poverty.\nEnergy communities\n\nRenewable Energy Communities (or RECs), recently introduced into our legal system, are associations of companies, businesses and members of the public who decide to join forces to equip themselves with one or more plants for the virtual and shared generation and self-consumption of electricity from renewable sources, achieving economic, environmental and social benefits.\n\nEnel X and Enel Green Power offer stakeholders the solutions and services to bring the energy community to life and make it grow in a virtuous way: from the construction of photovoltaic plants to the creation and technical-economic management of the community itself, from monitoring the community\u2019s state of service to stimulating the electrification of consumption through efficient technologies (heat pumps, induction hobs, etc.) and digital platforms. All with a view to making every energy community a truly efficient and sustainable ecosystem.\n\nIn Italy, thanks to current legislation (still awaiting Executive Decree), it has become possible to set up a condominium photovoltaic system and allow all condominiums to take advantage of it, thus creating an excellent opportunity to take advantage of a shared space that until now was almost unusable for the benefit of all.\n\nThe program involves the construction of a 10 kWp photovoltaic system for each condominium staircase, reaching a total installed system of 60 kWp, or generating about 70,000 kWh/year in total. A self-consumption of 62,300 kWh per year is estimated, which ensures the abatement of about 30 tons of CO\u2082 emitted. An estimated reduction of more than 60% in electricity use from the grid is expected, with clear benefits in terms of savings for apartment blocks. The project is not only limited to the generation and self-consumption of apartment block energy, but aims to offer a shared mobility and charging service. It would increase the overall consumption of the apartment building by 15-20% and the solution can also be implemented in existing, balanced situations.\n\nBlufi: a reality projected towards the future\n\nBlue Green Energy. This is the name of the project joined by Blufi, a small village located 800 meters above sea level, right in the heart of the Madonie Mountains, in the province of Palermo (Italy). A small village of about a thousand inhabitants that in the springtime sees the surrounding fields transformed into a carpet of thousands of wild red tulips. This \u201cLittle Holland\u201d has decided to accept Enel X\u2019s proposal to found the first \u201cinter-municipal\u201d Renewable Energy Community, which will involve five other municipalities in the Madonie: Bompietro, Castellana, Geraci, Petralia Soprana and Petralia Sottana. Specifically, the project includes the construction of three photovoltaic plants on the roofs of municipal school buildings, with a total capacity of 64 kWp, to which others will be added as soon as possible, by government-run or private entities.\n\nThis will result in the generation of around 90,000 kWh per year of clean electricity, which will be shared with an original core of 16 members. This will bring the following benefits:\n\n- **environmental**, reducing emissions by about 29 tons of CO\u2082 per year;\n- **economic**, thanks to the provision by the Gestore dei Servizi Energetici (GSE \u2013 Energy Services Operator) of a bonus of \u20ac15,000 per year (for 20 years) to be distributed among the members of the community;\n- **social**, with a concrete contribution to savings on expenditure and reducing energy poverty.\nElectric mobility to accelerate the energy transition\n\nWe actively promote electric mobility as a key factor in reducing road transport emissions and contributing to the achievement of the European Union\u2019s energy efficiency goals. Mobility is also a critical aspect of social inclusion and an important determinant of human well-being, especially for disadvantaged groups. Indeed, recognized as an essential service in the European pillar of social rights, transport meets a fundamental need in enabling citizens to integrate into society and the labor market.\n\nWe believe that an ecosystem of interconnected, intelligent products and services needs to be developed to spread the world of e-mobility. Our aim is to improve, simplify and make the world of e-mobility accessible, and to do this we have developed smart charging solutions to suit every need.\n\nOur journey in this direction started a long time ago, but in 2022, in order to cater to the rapidly growing market, we decided to create a separate Business Line, Enel X Way, fully dedicated to the expansion of infrastructure for charging electric vehicles, the development of advanced charging technologies and flexible solutions to improve the customer experience and support the electrification of transport for consumers, businesses and cities.\n\nNew frontiers of electric mobility: e-boating in Portofino\n\nOur goal is to make electric mobility affordable and increasingly efficient, including in areas such as:\n\n- **Urban Air Mobility (UAM):** we have signed an agreement with Urban V, the company founded by Aeroporti di Roma, to develop efficient and effective charging solutions for electric vertical take-off aircraft, the air mobility of the future;\n- **electric boating:** we have developed charging infrastructure for electric boats now present in Portofino and Cernobbio (Italy) and on Lake Tahoe (California).\n\nThe electric boating market is booming, driven in part by increasing customer interest in sustainable tourism that reduces air and noise pollution, among other things.\n\nIt is precisely in this context that Enel X Way\u2019s initiative to support the Ligurian municipality\u2019s \u201cPortofino Carbon Free\u201d project was born, thanks to which a fast charging infrastructure for electric boats located at Molo Umberto I is now operational. This initiative represents a tangible sign of Enel X Way\u2019s commitment to an increasingly sustainable future for the area.\n\n\u201cThrough this installation we give continuity to our project of having a comprehensive infrastructure for the marine sector, both on the sea and on the lake. Equipping ourselves with these new technologies allows us to enhance the area and increasingly turn our sights toward sustainable tourism.\u201d\n\nLorenzo Rambaldi\nHead of Innovability Enel X Way\nThe transition to a decarbonized economy passes through sustainable transport for all\n\nThe full transition to e-mobility will only be possible through the widespread deployment of safe, reliable and user-friendly charging stations. This is why we have developed a wide range of public and domestic charging infrastructures, capable of charging electric vehicles anywhere at any time. We have also developed a business model that spans from the installation and management of charging points, the so-called Charging Point Operator (CPO), in which we already rank among the most pervasive companies in the world, directly managing more than 22,6 thousand public charging points, the provision of direct electric charging services to end customers (Mobility Service Provider \u2013 MSP), through more than 260,000 charging points, accessible through the Enel X Way APP\u2122.\n\nOur solutions in the public sector are the Enel X Way Waypole\u2122, for charging up to 22 kW in alternating current, while for electric mobility on roads with a high volume of traffic, we have launched the Enel X Way Waypump\u2122, which, thanks to a modular approach, can reach powers of up to 350 kW(5) in direct current, enough to charge an electric vehicle to 80% in about 15 minutes.\n\nIn the private sector, on the other hand, we have developed the Enel X Way Waybox\u2122 to meet domestic charging needs. This can detect the consumption of other household appliances connected to the home meter, so that the maximum available capacity is never exceeded. In the world of relevant business offerings, there is the Set&Charge solution, which enables the creation of shared value for our B2B customers, allowing them to turn their charging infrastructure also into a source of revenue by making it available to the public and setting their own service tariffs.\n\nGuillermo Fumanal Achon\nHead of Sustainability Enel X Way\n\n\u201cCircularity is a natural feature of our design, as we know that the use of innovative and sustainable materials increases the resilience of our product supply chains, mitigates impacts on the geopolitical and social front (less need for materials, less exposure to the risk of human rights violations), and finally allows us to foreshadow ourselves as a Net-Zero company.\u201d\n\n(5) For vehicles with 800V batteries (under the plan only Audi, Kia, Hyundai, Genesis, Porsche, Volvo, Polestar, Stellantis, General Motors, BYD and Lotus have so far announced or launched electric cars with this feature).\nIncreasingly inclusive mobility\n\nThere is no real revolution in mobility if it is not truly accessible to everyone. That is why we promote and devise solutions that solve all mobility needs, so that even people with disabilities or reduced mobility conditions can benefit freely and independently from the opportunities offered by modern e-mobility, starting with the charging infrastructure. Our charging points dedicated to electric vehicles can now also be used to charge electric wheelchairs, thanks to our Enel X Way Wayability device, a charging cable that enables use of the same infrastructure dedicated to electric cars. In this way, can take advantage of any charging point by booking through our app in the same way as for electric cars.\n\nCreative common\nUniversal Design\n\nWhen it comes to designing electric car charging points, we cannot overlook motorists and passengers with reduced mobility. This is why our infrastructure has been redesigned in cooperation with ANGLAT (National Association of Transport Handicapped Drivers) on the basis of an inclusive design, called Universal Design, which provides parking stalls with an additional signposted maneuvering area for wheelchairs and bollards to protect the charging stations from impacts resulting from any incorrect and accidental maneuvers. In addition, the charging cable is lighter, so that it can be handled more easily by wheelchair users.\n\nOn the occasion of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities on December 3, 2022, we made the intellectual property of Universal Design accessible for free, allowing anyone to download our guidelines directly from our website.\n\nE-mobility\nEmission Saving\n\nOver the past year, Enel X Way has adopted the calculation methodology of the \u201ce-mobility Emission Saving Tool 4.0\u201d version, the tool developed to provide evidence of the organization\u2019s commitment to sustainable mobility through the electrification of the vehicle fleet on the road. The algorithm was certified by RINA on December 28, 2021 according to the principles set out in the UNI EN ISO 14064-2:2019 Greenhouse gases Part 2 standard. In version 4.0, the tool has added, compared to the previous version, quantification of the environmental benefit in terms of CO\u2082eq (CO\u2082, CH\u2084 and N\u2082O) savings. Version 3.0 of the tool already made it possible to determine the savings, generated by the distribution of public and private charging stations on the territory, of CO\u2082 equivalent trees per year, pollutants (NO\u2093, PM), noise and the associated economic quantification on health and environment. Compared to 2021, there has been an increase in the energy delivered by charging stations resulting in a significant increase in CO\u2082 savings, due to the increased deployment of both electric vehicles and Enel X Way\u2019s public and private charging points connected to the grid.\nPromoting access to energy and combating energy poverty\n\nAccess to energy is a challenge and a primary need as stated by the United Nations SDG 7, which aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy systems for all, due to the role they play as a driving force for fighting poverty and ensuring long-term economic and sustainable growth.\n\nIn its \u201cEnergy Progress Report\u201d 2022, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reports that, at the current rate, the world will fail to meet the targets of SDG 7 by 2030. In recent years, it reads, there has been a slowdown due to the increasing complexity of reaching remote unassisted populations and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The latter, in particular, continues to hold back economic development, which is also weighed down by the energy crisis triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nAccording to the latest available data, there are still 733 million people without access to electricity, a figure that, although down from 1.2 billion in 2010, should be read in conjunction with the fact that the recent slowdown in the general trend has particularly affected the most vulnerable countries and those that were already lagging behind.\n\nAt Enel, we are committed to ensuring that as many people as possible have access to energy, both by using traditional means (connections to the electricity distribution grid) and by developing off-grid solutions, and this enabled us to connect around 690,000 people in rural and suburban areas in 2022.\n\nIn Brazil, 25,800 connections were made in the State of Cear\u00e1 through on-grid and off-grid solutions in remote areas. The project reached 103,200 people from different isolated communities and traditional populations (indigenous or quilombos).\n\nIn Chile, during 2022, 1,900 new suburban connections were built in the municipalities of Lampa, Pudahuel, Colina and Maip\u00fa. Enel Distribuci\u00f3n, in alliance with Fundaci\u00f3n Techo and Litro de Luz, installed solar lights and a Wi-Fi point in the \u201cEl Esfuerzo 2\u201d camp in the municipality of Cerrillos, as well as offering workshops and training on renewable energies, entrepreneurship and digital literacy, thus attempting to promote social and economic development in the camp. Enel Grids is constantly committed to promoting and implementing training activities related to energy efficiency, electrical risk prevention for communities and climate change workshops, as well as carrying out initiatives to improve local employability such as the development of sustainable lighting in collaboration with the Litro de Luz foundation, initiatives that focus on the installation of technical tools that enable the autonomy required to ensure the long-term sustainability of the project. The monitoring process in each field is accompanied by a context analysis to measure the project\u2019s impact on the sustainability of electrification, as well as to establish a socio-energy analysis of the communities.\n\nIn the recent past, following the widespread increase in the prices of raw materials on international markets, there has been an increase in consumers who find it difficult to manage the energy expense, especially families with low incomes.\n\nThe main responsibility for guaranteeing safe and economic access to basic energy services obviously lies with governments, but the electric sector is also called on to provide a tangible contribution by promoting fair and sustainable social-economic development.\n\nIn all the countries where we operate we, together with governments and local institutions, have always been at the forefront of the fight against energy poverty and the campaign to facilitate access to energy for customers in vulnerable conditions, through specific initiatives to support the deployment of energy efficiency and responsible consumption solutions, the modernization of infrastructure and the growth of renewable energy sources, in line with our sustainable business model and our commitment to an just transition.\n\nIn this respect, our approach has two lines of action:\n\nPro-active actions aimed at anticipating critical situations through:\n\u2022 new offers that restructure the prices and reward reduced consumption;\n\u2022 support for vulnerable customers in accessing the benefits offered to them;\n\u2022 initiatives to disseminate practical tips for reducing consumption, etc.\n\nReactive actions when critical situations arise with ad hoc interventions:\n\u2022 suspension/deferral of payments;\n\u2022 access to tax bonuses or credits for customers in economic difficulties or affected by natural disasters.\n\nIn 2022, in developing countries alone, more than 182 energy access projects were developed that reached around...\n1.9 million beneficiaries and roughly 134 related partnerships were in place.\n\nSome examples of projects developed on an international level are provided below:\n\n**Training program on access to energy and social services (Spain).** This initiative is based on training courses on issues such as energy saving and efficiency measures, optimization of the electricity bill, the new Social Bonus and protection against having electricity cut off if the bills are overdue, and is directed towards NGOs and social services so they are able to improve their consultancy and their efforts for supporting families living in situations of vulnerability. In 2022 more than 106,000 beneficiaries were involved in the project, which was developed together with the trainers at Endesa Energ\u00eda and with the participation of approximately 100 institutions (NGOs). The purpose of this initiative is to demonstrate the Group\u2019s commitment to vulnerable groups and to contribute to the fight against energy poverty, improving the relationships with stakeholders, from local institutions, to municipalities and Non-Governmental Organizations. Involving the NGOs and social services in the task of observing and fighting fuel poverty increases their knowledge in order to help vulnerable families and as a result minimize the barriers to access to energy.\n\n**Enel Shares Citizenship Goias (Brazil).** In 2022, more than 13,471 beneficiaries were involved in the project that stages workshops and home visits to socially vulnerable families, disseminating information on how to reduce consumption, in line with other social projects carried out by the Company. The initiative promotes the inclusion of families in public social assistance policies, such as the low-income social tariff, which provides a discount of up to 65% on electricity bills.\n\n**We are committed to promoting access to energy in developing countries** not only by supplying electricity, but also clean, innovative technologies to the population in order to generate energy that has a reduced impact on the environment. Approximately 1,364 MW of energy from renewable sources was commissioned in Latin America in 2022, increasing the total renewable capacity to approximately 20,808 MW. In Africa, Enel Green Power is currently the main private operator in the renewable sector in terms of installed capacity (more than 1,500 MW in operation and 598 MW under construction), with a presence in different countries, including South Africa, Zambia and Morocco. In Asia, the Group is present in India through its subsidiary Enel Green Power India, one of the country\u2019s main renewable energy companies, which owns and manages 340 MW of wind capacity, producing approximately 620 GWh a year in Gujarat and Maharashtra.\n\n**PERU - Enlightening my community**\n\nThis is a program that provides clean and efficient energy to the most vulnerable rural communities close to our sites which currently lack electricity, aiming to contribute to their development and to the improvement of their living conditions by opening up a range of opportunities in relation to education, business development, connectivity, recreation inside and outside the home, and security, thus generating inclusive and sustainable growth. The communities we target are located in areas that are not part of the districts in our concession area, so they cannot be served as customers. Since 2021, we have installed renewable hybrid systems at 6 locations in 3 regions of the country, with a total installed power of 30,130 MW, benefiting more than 3,500 people, as well as educational centers, sports grounds, public lighting, and municipal premises, thus avoiding the emission of 52.34 tons of CO\u2082 per year.\nOur governance for promoting access to energy\n\nOur commitment to guaranteeing access to energy is also confirmed in our 2023-2025 Strategic Plan through the definition of specific objectives, including an increase in renewable sources, the development of sustainable and circular products and services, engaging local communities through a model for creating shared value (please see the chapter, \"Engaging communities\"). The Strategic Plan, the Sustainability Plan that describes in detail the goals and commitments from an ESG point of view, including access to energy and the corresponding financial and non-financial reporting are analyzed and monitored by the Board of Directors, by means of the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee and the Control and Risk Committee (see the Corporate Governance report, available at www.enel.com).\n\nTop management is committed on a daily basis to realizing these strategic objectives by contributing towards supporting the global challenge of guaranteeing access to energy. To support Top Management, each Country is responsible for managing relationships with institutional bodies, regulatory authorities on a national, regional and local level, and associations for promoting the development of solutions for access to energy according to different needs. The Innovability\u00ae Function, both on a holding level as well as a Business Line/Country level, also promotes the dissemination of a shared value model. It supports innovative solutions that can promote access to energy in remote areas with limited access to electricity.\nOur commitment to a just transition: leaving no one behind\nAs early as the signing of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the connection between climate change and the impacts of the measures taken in response to it were acknowledged by signatory countries in its preamble. By acknowledging that climate change is a common concern of humankind, signatories were requested, when taking action to address it, to respect, promote and consider their respective obligations on human rights, the right to health, the rights of local communities, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of women and intergenerational equity.\n\nA just transition is a key tool to ensure that the road to a climate-neutral economy is equitable and does not leave anyone behind.\n\nJust transition plans also show the way on how to best address social, economic and environmental challenges, with a specific focus on:\n\n- **workers** directly affected by the transition, who need to be supported through requalification and/or by a facilitated access to job opportunities in new sectors;\n- **people and society** at large, with a particular focus on the most vulnerable, who need facilitated access to new services, like energy efficiency for buildings, measures to fight energy poverty, and to clean and affordable energy;\n- **business** active in high-emitting industries or sectors who will need to be supported through actions easing the switch to green technologies and leading to an economy based on climate-resilient jobs and investments, also by spurring the setting up of new companies and investing in research and innovation;\n- **States** and regions heavily dependent on fossil fuels and on high-emitting industries.\n\nBusiness plays a central role in economy decarbonization since much of the CO\u2082 emissions causing climate change comes from business-driven economic activity. It acts as an enabler of innovation and solutions to prevent, mitigate and adapt to climate change and its adverse impacts on nature and people.\n\nThe role of the **energy sector** in transitioning away from a fossil-fuel based economy is crucial. Producers will need to scale up their contribution in terms of development of green technologies, grid infrastructure will need to be strengthened and digitalized to enable electrification and an efficient use of energy, and consumers will have to\n\nPlease refer to the following chapters of the Sustainability Report:\n\n1. Zero emissions ambition\n2. Empowering Enel people\n3. Sustainable supply chain\n4. Engaging communities\n5. Clean electrification\nchange their behaviors, playing an active role in electrification of uses and contributing to optimization of energy utilization. **Innovation** and **circular economy** will be vital to limit the use of newly extracted material thus reducing pressure on the supply side and mitigating human rights risks. Finally, **inclusive approaches** will be key to manage the impacts of the major changes green technologies will bring and make sure that the transitions will benefit the broader society, without leaving anyone behind. A well-managed transition may help addressing the human and economic impacts of a changing climate and also foster growth, generate net new jobs and reduce inequality.\n\n**Our strategy and our commitment for a just transition**\n\nEvery day we work for an inclusive transition by leveraging engagement of our stakeholders (Enel people, suppliers and financial and commercial partners, communities in the areas of influence of our operations, our customers, the financial community) since we are aware that we belong to the territory and we are an essential element in the lives of people, business and society at large.\n\nOur contribution to an affordable, secure and sustainable energy system goes through accelerating **decarbonization of our energy production mix**, in line with the Paris Agreement targets, thanks to the development of **renewable capacity**, coupled with energy storage, and the progressive phase-out of thermal generation sources. At the same time, we are strengthening the role of **distribution networks**, which in the future, due to the combination of greater use of electricity and greater diffusion of green technologies, will have to be increasingly reliable and digitalized in order to act as inclusive platforms for all our **customers** with whom our challenge will be to facilitate their switch to electricity for all uses and to new highly-digital services.\n\nAll of this while leveraging **innovation** and **circular economy** which act as accelerators of this path since they reduce pressure on materials and technologies critical to the achievement of our goals as well as making it possible for...\nbusiness models to evolve in an even more sustainable direction. Further information is available at \u201cOur strategy for sustainable progress\u201d.\n\nWe fully support the principles of a just transition, as outlined in the International Labour Organization (ILO) Just Transition Guidelines, so that no one is left behind, and we are aware of the social impact of our decarbonization strategy, which is in line with the Paris Agreement, and that we manage by taking into account our overall commitment in terms of respecting human rights throughout the value chain, as also set out in our Human Rights Policy which states that:\n\nA fair and inclusive transition does not leave anyone behind and takes into account the needs of all the stakeholders, and, specifically, the most vulnerable ones. To this end we:\n\n- proactively consider the needs and priorities of people and wider society because this leads to process and product innovation which is key for a competitive, inclusive and sustainable business model, including the adoption of circularity principles, protection of natural capital and of biodiversity;\n- promote the involvement of the main external and internal stakeholders to enhance awareness and develop a constructive dialogue that can provide a valuable contribution to the creation of solutions that mitigate climate change.\n\n(Enel\u2019s commitment to respecting human rights)\n\nAt the heart of our strategy is our contribution to building a fairer and more inclusive society across the whole value chain, since we believe that our integrated business model coupled with a sustainable business conduct enables contribution to the 2030 Agenda.\n\nIn 2019, we signed the United Nations Pledge Letter on business commitment to a just transition and green, decent jobs and we have committed to:\n\n- promoting multi-stakeholder engagement and social dialogue with institutions, workers\u2019 and their representatives, respecting workers\u2019 rights, encouraging social protection (including pensions and health care), and providing wage guarantees, in line with the core and occupational health and safety standards of the International Labor Organization (ILO);\n- working with existing and new suppliers that respect these standards, supporting them to increase their resilience in a transitioning economy, while advocating and acting for diversification of the supply chain of technologies critical to net zero achievement;\n- contributing to the social and economic development of local communities, particularly so in the case of those most exposed to the transition out from fossil fuels and into green technologies;\n- supporting customers in their electrification journey while at the same time allowing for an affordable, secure and green access to energy.\n\nDuring the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \u2013 COP27, we signed jointly with other 270 corporates and civil society leaders, a declaration reciting \u201cWe stand ready to deliver a just transition and an equitable and inclusive future for all. We want to work with governments in building an enduring legacy based on our collective efforts to secure 1.5 \u00b0C\u201d.\n\nWe have therefore defined specific plans and lines of work for a just transition, also at country level, consistently with the Group\u2019s strategy to decarbonize its generation capacity, with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, with the principles of the ILO\u2019s Just Transition Guidelines and the UN pledge, as well as with the public commitments outlined in our human rights policy.\nThe plan hinges on three pillars:\n\n- **involving** internal and external stakeholders to increase their awareness about a just transition and foster a constructive dialogue that can contribute valuably;\n- **transition out** of high carbon activities, supporting the vocational requalification of direct and indirect workers, developing socio-economic plans for affected communities and helping customers to quit conventional technologies;\n- **transition into** green technologies, facilitating access to new job opportunities for direct and indirect workers, and the development of inclusive and accessible solutions for communities and customers.\n\nOur plan and our lines of work for a just transition\n\n**Plan**\n\n- **Enel people**\n  - Social dialog, social protection and wage guarantees, in line with ILO standards.\n\n- **Supply chain**\n  - Support for increasing resilience in the transitioning economy and the diversification of \u2018net-zero\u2019 critical technologies.\n\n- **Communities**\n  - Contribution to socio-economic development, with a focus on those transitioning away from fossil fuels generation.\n\n- **Customers**\n  - Support in electrification journey and to access affordable, secure and green energy.\n\n**Lines of action**\n\n1. **Engagement**\n   - Stakeholders\u2019 priorities analysis + Awareness raising campaigns + Advocacy + Other multi-stakeholder initiatives\n   - Social dialog and listening\n   - Thematic supporting events (for example, decarbonization, circularity, human rights)\n   - Ongoing dialog to disseminate benefits of green transition in terms of climate change and socio-economics development\n   - Initiatives on decarbonization and electrification of uses\n\n2. **Transition out**\n   - Upskilling/reskilling, redeployment, sharing of knowledge\n   - Joint work on circular and low carbon supply models + upskilling/reskilling for workers whose jobs may disappear\n   - Development of individual and multi-stakeholder activities to manage challenges and create shared value opportunities\n   - Analysis of barriers and intervention areas to facilitate dropping out of conventional technologies\n\n3. **Transition in**\n   - Upskilling/reskilling to green jobs and digital\n   - Supplier development program (managerial and technical training to foster business reconversion and internationalization)\n   - Access to credit, inclusive business products, training aimed at facilitating access to employment and gender-gap reduction\n   - Empowerment and accessible and inclusive transition\nStakeholders\u2019 engagement\n\nWe promote a broad engagement of stakeholders, both internal and external, in line with our Open Power approach, aimed at enhancing their awareness and developing a constructive dialogue that can contribute valuably to a just transition. Such activities may be overarching, take the form of advocacy or of participation to initiatives promoting a fair and inclusive transition, as well as being tailored to specific stakeholders categories.\n\nAnalysis of stakeholders\u2019 priorities\n\nRoutinary and direct involvement of all our stakeholders through a structured process of \u2018materiality\u2019 analysis is one of the pillars of the definition of Enel\u2019s strategy. This allows to identify material topics, i.e., topics that represent the most significant impacts of the organization on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on human rights.\n\nFor more details, please refer to \u201cMateriality analysis process and results for 2022\u201d.\n\nAwareness raising campaigns\n\nAwareness raising campaigns are a focal element to empower our stakeholders in the transition to net zero. Our activities to this end are tailored to:\n\n- people working in the organization, to support their commitment and sense of purpose as well as nurturing a culture of inclusion;\n- suppliers, to support their path of change and growth since the transformation of the energy sector coupled with the push on digital requires a different approach to executing works or providing goods and services;\n- communities in our area of influence, with whom we have a structured approach to set up a broad, inclusive and ongoing dialogue and identify shared solutions;\n- customers, whose active participation to the transition needs to be fostered and supported.\n\nAdvocacy\n\nPromoting a just transition at all institutional levels is fundamental since there is a need to agree on what public policies need to be in place to ensure achievement of decarbonization objectives.\n\nBoth our direct and indirect advocacy activities are conducted in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and with our decarbonization roadmap. Specifically, we involve institutional stakeholders, trade associations, non-governmental organizations, and academia, in order to promote our vision on climate and low-carbon policies, to contribute to the evolution of the regulatory framework towards ambitious climate goals and to promote an economy in which carbon pricing drives long-term investments.\n\nTo this end, we interact directly with policy makers, contribute to the positioning of trade associations, and involve a broader set of stakeholders to build consensus and support for specific policy proposals.\n\nFor full details on our direct and indirect advocacy activities, please refer to \u201cAdvocacy about climate change policies\u201d.\n\n- Joint statement on just energy transition\n  In November 2021, the European social partners - Eurelectric, IndustriALL and EPSU - signed a joint statement on just energy transition, based on the principles defined in the ILO Just Transition Guidelines. Through such statement they have fully subscribed to the objectives of the European Green Deal while acknowledging the need for a more consistent effort by the EU to define a European strategy for the electricity sector and the transition of its workforce as well as the establishment of a coherent regulatory framework.\n\nRecommended actions include:\n\n- requiring countries to implement inclusive governance and participatory mechanisms, social dialogue and full transparency of transition planning;\n- setting a European framework on the anticipation and management of change;\n- offering employees lifelong learning to maintain a qualified workforce since the \u2018twin transition\u2019 (decarbonization and digitalization) prompts development of new business models thus spurring continuous changes in terms of job profiles needed.\n\nCommitments include:\n\n- promoting social dialogue and collective bargaining, at all levels;\n- supporting the anticipation of skills and the need to provide workers with the opportunity to update their skills.\nsupporting and promoting reskilling and upskilling through continuous professional development and life-long learning.\n\n**European Works Council**\nWe maintain a high-profile social dialogue also through the European Works Council, last renewed in July 2016, a body introduced by European Directive 94/45/EC representing the European employees of a company. Through it, workers are informed and consulted by management on the progress of the business.\n\nIn March 2022, a plenary meeting was held and attended by several representatives of Enel\u2019s management, sharing the Group\u2019s positioning on the transition and the various initiatives in place in the company to ensure a fair process and a workforce increasingly prepared for change. For further details, please refer to \u201cIndustrial relations\u201d in \u201cEmpowering Enel people\u201d.\n\n**United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \u2013 COP27**\nThe Sharm El Sheikh Implementation Plan includes a clear reference to just transition resolving to implement ambitious, just, equitable and inclusive transitions to lower emission and climate-resilient development in line with the Paris Agreement. It affirms that sustainable and just solutions to the climate crisis must be founded on meaningful and effective social dialogue and participation of all stakeholders and notes that the global transition to low emissions provides opportunities and challenges for sustainable economic development and poverty eradication. It also emphasizes that a just and equitable transition encompasses pathways that include energy, socioeconomic, workforce and other dimensions.\n\nA work program, including a yearly ministerial meeting, was also decided to discuss about the necessary steps to achieve the Paris Agreement objectives.\n\n**Electric mobility**\nWe actively promote e-mobility as a key factor in reducing road transport emissions and contributing to the European Union\u2019s energy efficiency targets.\n\nMobility is a critical aspect of social inclusion and an important contributor to human well-being, especially for vulnerable groups.\n\nTransport, recognized as an essential service in the European pillar of social rights, meets a fundamental need in enabling citizens to integrate into society and the labor market.\n\n**Other multi-stakeholder initiatives**\n\n**Just Transition Think Lab**\nAmong the main initiatives promoted by the Global Compact, the Think Lab, developed in collaboration with the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) brings together global leading companies on the topic, clarifying the strategic importance for the business to support and engage in a fair transition that leaves no one behind, examining challenges, opportunities and encouraging the sharing of best practices and joint policy-advocacy actions.\n\nIn 2022 we contributed to the development of the following business briefs:\n\n1. **Introduction to Just Transition** \u2013 outlining the behaviors and priority actions for companies to undertake a right transition.\n2. **Just Transition for Climate Adaptation** \u2013 exploring how mitigation and adaptation actions implemented by companies to address the risks and impacts of climate change must consider a fair and equitable approach from a social standpoint.\n3. **Financing a Just Transition** \u2013 focused on the role of finance in promoting a fair transition. The report also includes two Enel case studies: SDG-Linked Bonds and Futur-E.\n\n**Business Commission to Tackle Inequality (BCTI)**\nPromoted by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), it brings together business leaders and key stakeholders with the aim of building a new common narrative on the role of companies in the fight against inequalities, raising the issue of inequality in business agendas and strategies.\n\nWe are part of both the Commissioners\u2019 group and of the following working groups: 1. Respect for human rights; 2. Access to essential products and services; 3. Diversity, equity and inclusion 4. Preparing people for the future of work. We also contributed to the launch of the introductory report \u201cTackling inequality: The need and opportunity for business action\u201d and we are cooperating for the launch of the initiative Flagship Report, expected in late 2023.\n\n**CSR Europe Leaders Hub for an Inclusive Green Deal**\nSelected group of CSR Europe members who have worked on identifying the actions and tools needed by companies to facilitate a fair transition in the context of the green and digital transformations. We have been involved both in the Steering Committee and in working groups on workforce, communities and consumers. A Roadmap for a Just Transition was presented during the European SDG Summit, with the aim of providing companies with a strategic direction to contribute substantially to a just transition.\nThe document contains three Enel case studies: Value 4 Disability, Soft Leadership and Re-generation. In the first months of 2023, a second document was also launched, the \u2018European Business Toolbox for Just Transition\u2019 which provides additional tools for integrating just transition into business strategies.\n\n- **Solar stewardship initiative**\n  It is an initiative launched by the member-led association Solar Power Europe with the aim to ensure that solar products imported to our continent are not associated to human rights violations, as well as being aimed at enhancing the level of transparency, including a broader approach to sustainability, and therefore addressing the requirements that might be included in the upcoming European Union legislation.\n\n- **Global Alliance for Sustainable Energy**\n  An independent global alliance, open to all actors recognizing the urgency of tackling the climate emergency according to \u2018just transition\u2019 principles and the need to promote and embed sustainability and social responsibility in the renewable energy industry. The Alliance\u2019s initial efforts will focus on four key themes: net-zero & CO\u2082 footprint; circular design & economy; human rights; and water footprint. In addition to representatives of industry, industry associations, academia, the Global Alliance for Sustainable Energy involves civil society and especially young people to accelerate the energy transition. An energy transition that is just and leaves no one behind.\n\n### Tailored engagement activities\n\n**Enel people | Playing a leading role in the transition**\n\nListening and actively engaging the people working in Enel are core elements to foster their commitment and action on the strategy the Group is pursuing. Hereafter, the most relevant activities:\n\n- **Enel Digital Days**\n  The format runs on a proprietary digital platform that includes live streaming and on-demand content, designed according to accessibility and inclusivity standards (voice over and sub-titles in the languages spoken in the organization). 2022 edition: the narration hinged on the decade of electrification and the central role played by customers to achieve the transition, with focus areas on decarbonization and renewables, digitalization and data-driven, role of the distribution grids, energy communities. Contents are still available on-demand and the campaign achieved 36,000 unique users and 300,000 content views.\n\n- **Strategic alignment tracking**\n  In 2021, we also launched a data-driven program to measure, on a rolling basis, how much the people working in our organization feel empowered to navigate through the transition, across strategic levers such as electrification of uses, acceleration of the decarbonization path, customer centrality and the new way of working. Main objectives of the program are:\n  - keep track of the sentiment of our people about the company;\n  - understand their level of knowledge and engagement with respect to the key strategic pillars, as well as to specific projects developed to:\n    - spread Enel\u2019s clean electrification pathway;\n    - spread key notions around health, safety and well-being, diversity and inclusion, job opportunities, learning and development, listening and feedback, among others;\n    - stimulate them to become \u2018enablers\u2019, like contributing to the SDGs, customer centricity, digitalization and data-driven culture, cybersecurity and data protection, technological innovation and circular economy;\n  - identify the communication channels that facilitate understanding of a topic;\n  - develop internal communication action/remediation plans on the topics/programs least understood;\n  - track results and effectiveness of actions implemented over time.\n\nOverall population breaks down in 4 clusters, each representative of the composition of the full workforce by gender, age, role, and seniority, the survey is carried out 4 times a year (4 waves), and results are on an aggregate basis as well as per country. After each wave, results are analyzed jointly with countries/business lines/staff functions so as to define an immediate action plan, if necessary.\n\n---\n\n(1) Industrial members: 3M, Acciona, Adani renewables, EDP, Eletrobras, Enel Green Power, Goldwind, Iberdrola, JA Solar, Nordex, NTPC, Prysmian, Risen Energy, Trina Solar. Advisory members: European Space Agency, Global Solar Council, Global Wind Energy Council, Politecnico di Milano, Politecnico di Torino, Student Energy and Youth Climate Leaders. Supporting members: IRENA coalition for action.\n\n(2) 6 for the 2022 campaign and 5 for the 2022-2023 campaign as a result of the Group\u2019s exit from Russia.\nIn 2022, redemption was equal to 33.4%, higher than similar preceding surveys. Among the internal communication channels, the company intranet turns out to be the most effective means of communication.\n\nIn terms of reputation, perception is positive and generally higher than the average of other companies belonging to heterogeneous sectors (for example, telecommunications, financial) and with a perimeter comparable to the one of the Group (multinational companies).\n\nPositive aspects concern the care given to the people working in the organization, who are rewarded equitably, the responsible and transparent conduct in communication and relations with the stakeholders, protection of environment and commitment to generate both environmental and social positive impacts. Among the aspects to work on further, the ability to offer increasingly accessible products and services.\n\nIn addition, people working with us identify with the \u201cOpen Power for a Brighter Future\u201d purpose, feel involved in the strategy, and actively promote it, both internally and externally, and would recommend Enel as a workplace.\n\nSuppliers | Thematic events\n\nSuppliers are our partners in the sustainable growth path. We promote a cooperative joint effort to maximize the economic, productive, social and environmental advantages of the transition. We are committed to creating sustainable processes, both innovative and circular, that allow to better quantify, and then mitigate, total impacts they generate.\n\nWe have in place thematic events concerning decarbonization, adopting circular business models, respecting human rights with the aim of sharing best practices and multi-stakeholder approaches in line with the international reference standards for a sustainable conduct.\n\nCommunities | Ongoing dialogue\n\nWe collaborate with communities with the intent of identifying how we can work together for their socio-economic development, including fostering access to energy, fighting energy poverty, supporting quality education.\n\nActivities include spreading the notion that a transition to green technologies to fight climate change is not just beneficial to the environment and the preservation of the related human rights but that it brings socio-economic development. Indeed, the creation of new jobs is estimated to outweigh the loss of fossil-fuel related ones, and may represent a further tool to contribute to improving gender balance in the working environment as well as contributing to an improved quality of life.\n\nCustomers | Communication campaigns and international initiatives\n\n- **Social media and website**\n  We develop initiatives to raise public awareness on decarbonization and electrification of uses.\n  Worth mentioning:\n  - #WattAChange, a campaign to highlight the importance of green technologies in the European energy context,\n  - the Enel website section dedicated to the strategic role of electricity in driving decarbonization and also enhanced through the social channels of the Enel Group (https://www.enel.com/company/our-commitment/electricity-role-europe-decarbonization).\n\n- **Power2People**\n  Power2People is a Eurelectric initiative aimed at fostering customers\u2019 engagement in actively taking part in the energy transition and how different actors in the new energy ecosystem can support them on this journey. We take part into this initiative as chair of the customers and new services working group.\n\nExamples of facts-based actions to empower customers to utilize digital green technologies are:\n  - the publicly available study on the critical role heat pumps play. On average, European households save 39% on their bills when switching from fossil fuel powered heating systems to electric heat pumps. In addition, they provide an up to 400% efficiency gain over comparable gas boilers when installed in properly insulated homes and the flexibility of the technology allows for their use in a variety of household settings, including in multifamily homes, or as part of district heating and cooling systems;\n  - the publicly available study on smart thermostats, a relatively easy to use and implement technology which helps households and enterprises of all sizes improve their energy efficiency and optimize consumption without reducing user comfort and providing flexibility to the power system by adjusting consumption during peak periods. They can also provide consumers with an average of 10-15% of energy savings when connected to climate control devices like electric heat pumps or air conditioning units.\n\n- **15 Pledges to customers**\n  15 Pledges to customers was launched in March 2020 by Eurelectric and co-signed by more than 90 European electricity retailers, supported by their National Associations, who have committed to accompany cit-\n\n---\n\n(3) IEA, 2022 World Energy Outlook.\nizens in the energy transition with the broad aim to ensure a future European electricity system that is sustainable, reliable and inclusive. By signing the pledge electricity suppliers commit to developing a range of solutions to make sure that everyone can benefit from carbon neutral electric solutions and to facilitate the adoption of electro-mobility, energy efficiency services and renewable generation. The scope of the initiative also included understanding the key barriers preventing consumers from engaging in the energy transition by identifying common trends and local differences across nine countries (Ireland, Norway, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Czech Republic and Poland) involved in the joint collaboration effort with Eurelectric and Accenture through their national associations representing the electricity industry. For further details, please refer to \u201cCustomers | Empowering the transition\u201d, in the \u201cTransition in\u201d section of this chapter.\n\nTransition out\n\nEnel has defined a clear decarbonization roadmap of its energy mix, planning to complete the closure of all coal-fired power plants by 2027 and to exit both gas-fired electricity generation and gas sales to final customers by 2040. Such roadmap consists of four main actions:\n\n\u2022 promote electrification solutions powered by renewable sources;\n\u2022 complete fossil fuels phase-out;\n\u2022 accelerate the development of renewable sources;\n\u2022 digitalize and expand distribution networks.\n\nFor further details, please refer to \u201cOur strategy for sustainable progress\u201d.\n\nThe framework developed to achieve these objectives takes into account the needs of the people who work with us, the unions, our communities, our suppliers and our customers and applies to all thermoelectric generation plants impacted by the phaseout of fossil fuels, articulating in the adoption of inclusive practices through initiatives in which individual conditions, economic and social development and the general welfare of broader society are closely connected.\n\nIn 2015, we have launched the \u2018Futur-e\u2019 initiative in Italy that included thermal power plants no longer competitive on the market for a total capacity of 13 GW. The aim was to give new life to the sites that hosted the plants. Subsequently, we expanded the geographic footprint extending to Iberia and South America and leading to a portfolio of about 5 times higher than the initial one (c. 80 sites).\n\nBesides our direct involvement for other uses but always connected to the world of energy, we have expanded repurposing opportunities by integrating new business projects with complementary sustainable investments that meet the needs of the communities where the facilities are located. Specifically:\n\n\u2022 in Italy, with energy requalification projects in line with the transition objectives, the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan (Piano Nazionale Integrato Energia e Clima \u2013 PNIEC) and the European Fit for 55 and Repower EU objectives;\n\u2022 in the Iberian Peninsula with the progressive transition of coal-fired plants, like Teruel in Andorra, Compostilla in Le\u00f3n (closed in June 2020), Carboneras in Almer\u00eda Litoral (closed in December 2021) and As Pontes in Galicia; for the latter we have developed a plan of entailing approximately 2.7 billion euros of investment and the creation of more than 1,300 jobs (details of the plan are available at the following link https://www.endesa.com/en/press/press-room/news/energy-transition/development-plan-as-pontes-thermal-power-plant-closure);\n\u2022 in South America, where we have disconnected two coal plants, Tarapac\u00e1 that was closed on 31 December 2019 and Bocamina (group I in 2021 and group II in 2022). We have thus become the first electricity company in Chile to no longer use coal for its generation activities, 18 years ahead of the original goal of 2040 set by the Chilean National Decarbonisation Plan of 2019.\n\nConsistently with our commitment to a fair and inclusive transition, the plan for exiting thermal generation entails:\n\n\u2022 Enel people | maintaining and developing skills and know-how transfer\n  \u2014 agreed redeployment based on individual characteristics either in the same Business Line, on the renewable side, or in other Business Lines, in order to enhance human capital and know-how. Agreed redeployment (which also involves workers\u2019 representative bodies) is accompanied by reskilling and upskilling plans for strengthening existing skills or developing new skills needed in the new role. Redeployment does\nnot affect negatively role and contract type. In the case of Chile, for example, out of the 50 people working in the Tarapac\u00e1 power plant 26 have been re-deployed in other thermal generation units, 9 people in renewable generation, 3 in other areas of the company, while 12 opted for a voluntary exit accompanied by an economic, training and insurance package. For further details, please refer to the Bocamina dedicated box.\n\n- voluntary access to early retirement for those who are eligible. In the 2020\u20132022 period we have provisioned more than 1.5 billion euros dedicated to managing Enel people affected by the energy transition strategy.\n\n- Site repurposing/regeneration\n  - replacement of thermal production plants with renewable or hybrid plants, i.e. a combination of green technologies like, for example, renewables, storage, hydrogen;\n  - land reclamation and maximization of the reuse of abandoned structures, such as roads, infrastructure, high-voltage connections, buildings, etc. in line with our circular economy principles;\n  - engagement of impacted communities and development of multi-stakeholder projects to foster the creation of shared value throughout the project, from preliminary talks to the choice of the redevelopment project to pursue. The plan developed for the closure of the Bocamina plant contains at least two examples of this approach: for the site hosting the second unit, closed in September 2022, we drew up a project to transform the discharge of ash produced by combustion, amounting to 10 hectares, in a native forest. In addition, we signed a \u2018just transition\u2019 agreement with the municipality of Coronel that will allow the local government to invest in strengthening health services and education, in addition to the building of a new school and a new park (for further details, please refer to the dedicated box);\n  - third-party projects not in energy field that meet the needs of the communities in which the facilities are located. An example is the transformation of the site where the Porto Tolle plant operated to achieve environmental requalification and sustainable tourism thanks to a project of Human Company, a Florence-based group which is also Italy\u2019s leading open air tourism specialist.\n\n---\n\n[4] For further details, please refer to \u201cClean electrification\u201d dashboard and to the \u201cSustainable Repurposing Model\u201d box of \u201cConservation of natural capital\u201d chapter.\nThe first museum of the energy transition is being built in Montalto di Castro\n\nCulture, innovation and the energy transition: three fundamental aspects of Italy come together in the new energy exhibition center that will be built in our \u201cAlessandro Volta\u201d power plant in Montalto di Castro, in the province of Viterbo. The site once hosting the plant will become an \u201cintegrated and multifunctional energy hub\u201d thanks to the involvement of the community in the area of influence and in cooperation with the ACPV ARCHITECTS Antonio Citterio Patricia Viel studio.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the main objective of the project is to repurpose the site by developing the TECC, the Centre for Culture and Knowledge of the Energy Transition, an Energy Transition museum that will also host facilities dedicated to training, awareness-raising and energy thematic events.\n\nFurthermore, existing infrastructure will be expanded and integrated with new renewable capacity and storage, in line with our sustainability objectives, and this will contribute positively in terms of enhancement of the territory and livelihood of the local community. Third party entrepreneurial initiatives are also planned in line with our circularity strategy. Specifically, a portion of the land has been rented out to a local company for the building of a solar tracker factory, producing the devices that allow photovoltaic panels to follow sunlight during the day in order to maximize electricity production. The building of the factory will have positive outcomes for local employment and communities including, but not limited to, offering job opportunities to all site workers. In addition, spaces are dedicated to the study of further sustainable solutions, such as an innovative hydroponic greenhouse project.\nThe As Pontes plant is located in the north of the A Coru\u00f1a province, in the municipality of As Pontes de Garc\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez. It has been in operation since 1976 and it is the largest thermal plant in Spain. We have submitted to the Ministry of Ecological Transition as well as to the Regional Government of Galicia and the Council of As Pontes, a plan mainly including:\n\n- the dismantling of the coal plant (approximately 4 years) that will include training for the over 130 employed to such purpose, giving priority to local manpower and people who already worked in the plant;\n- the development of a 1.3 GW wind farm that will generate up to 2,300 jobs during construction and additional 274 direct jobs during the 25 years of estimated useful life;\n- the repurposing of the territory for new industrial uses including a smart tyre factory, that will create 750 direct jobs and will act as an economic vector for the terminal of the nearby port of Ferrol;\n- a biological plant for the recovery, development and production of natural fibre from recycled paper and cardboard, that will generate 150 direct and 400 indirect jobs;\n- the supply of electricity to Alcoa at a competitive price that would enable the latter to resume aluminum production after the downturn caused by the increase in energy prices;\n- a new logistics role for the outer port of Ferrol that will compensate the traffic decline connected to the shutdown of the plant by becoming a multi-client bulk terminal (transport and storage of bulk cargoes: grain, minerals, etc.);\n- green hydrogen generation plants, with the building of an electrolyser for up to 100 MW powered by the wind farm that will be built;\n- the development of a strategic wind maintenance logistics centre to support 120 Endesa\u2019s wind farms in Spain, that will entail the generation of 57 direct jobs;\n- training for local manpower, workers in auxiliary companies and to support women employment.\nTRANSITION OUT: Teruel (Spain)\n\nAfter 40 years of operations, Teruel\u2019s coal plant cooling towers have been demolished. The site will host photovoltaics and wind installations. An additional example of sustainable decarbonization and decommissioning.\n\nDevelopment of a hybrid energy hub, with photovoltaic and wind plants, storage and a green hydrogen installation: these are some of the projects included in the energy transition tender. A substantial change that will bring new jobs and will support requalification for the very people working in the plant thanks to job rotation. Hereby a few data:\n\n- energy transition tender: right to develop 953 MW, with the option to get to up to 1,200 MW;\n- building of 5 solar plants and 5 wind ones in a hybrid setup jointly with a storage system that will enable full exploitation of the renewable production;\n- more than 1,200 millions of euro to be invested;\n- industrial development coupled with a social plan entailing the generation of more that 3,500 jobs during construction, with 300 direct permanent jobs at regime;\n- training to upskill people in the area of influence in order for them to be able to work in the renewable energy sector and to open access to work to local unemployed people.\n\nIn addition to the plan connected to the energy transition tender, Teruel will also host a photovoltaic plant called SEDEIS V, for an installed capacity of circa 50 MW and an investment of approximately 40 million euros. The project will generate more than 280 jobs during construction (started in July 2022) and 8 permanent jobs for the operation and maintenance of the plant that will have an average life of 30 years.\nOn September 30, 2022, the town of Coronel witnessed a historic event. With the final disconnection of Bocamina II, Enel became the first company in Chile to close all of its coal-powered plants. The milestone occurred in an area historically associated with the coal industry, but that today aspires to transition to a more sustainable and inclusive development.\n\nBocamina contributed to Chile\u2019s national development and energy security and its shut-down has occurred at the end of a just transition plan launched two years before and aimed at maximizing value for Enel\u2019s people, suppliers and local communities.\n\nThe story of Michael Navarro is a good example. The shut-down of the plant has turned into an opportunity since it has offered him new options in the renewables field and, specifically, in the maintenance of the solar power plants of Enel in Chile. He has also gone from working 12-hour shift to a hybrid working framework. Now he works eight days a month at Enel Chile headquarters in Santiago or on-site the power plants in Antofagasta and Atacama. The rest of the month, he works remotely from his home so he can stay close to his family.\n\nThe people involved by the shut-down of the two units of the plant are 90: more than 60% has been redeployed in other areas of the company, like engineering and construction, renewables, health, safety, environment and quality whereas about 30% has enjoyed early retirement or voluntary redundancy, and about 7% has continued working for the Operations & Maintenance unit managing the plant.\n\nIn addition, the main contractors providing services to the Bocamina plant have been included in the eligibility programs for commercial retraining and professional skills.\nTransition in\n\nThe \u2018green transition\u2019 is the combination between technological innovation and actions aimed at a sustainable economic growth that fosters the transition from a system based on polluting energy sources to a virtuous model centered on green sources and social development at the same time. This transition couples with a digital one, which initially started for operating efficiency reasons and then transformed into a driving force for innovating traditional business models.\n\nSimilarly to \u2018transition out\u2019, however, the path to a \u2018green\u2019 and digital future must also be led in an inclusive way to enable all stakeholders to seize its opportunities and manage the risks involved. Like actions to promote requalification, vocational training, and self-learning, in the case of direct and indirect workers, support for business diversification and increased resilience for supply chain companies, as well as generation of value for communities, through access to local job opportunities, and facilitating access to products and services for customers.\n\nEnel people | Lifelong learning\n\nThe rapid and continuous evolution of the business and the support to a fair transition strategy towards low carbon technologies and services entail the need for new technical and professional profiles and the awareness that some jobs will disappear. This context prompts for an ongoing training activity accompanying people throughout their personal and professional life in a sort of \u201ccircular path\u201d, starting from school up to when the working activity ends and returning consolidated knowledge to new generations and to the ecosystem will be key.\n\nEmpowerment becomes therefore crucial to evolve culturally, because it allows to fully involve people, motivating them to express their potential, while at the same time providing them with opportunities for personal and professional development, and contributing to create conditions of well-being, motivation, responsibility and participation that will enable the achievement of strategic objectives. Among the initiatives implemented:\n\n- retraining and professional updating, up/reskilling, self-learning and knowledge transfer. Our business lines\nSchools & Academies have organized existing skills improvement programs to allow participants to access more advanced career paths (upskilling) and to learn new skills (reskilling) to hold different positions and roles, also through the enhancement of soft and transversal skills. Such programs have been realized also in collaboration with university and academic partners:\n\n- support for the dissemination of the digital culture and the utilization of digital media;\n- promotion of women\u2019s presence in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) classes and jobs. We collaborate with schools, universities, and institutions to overcome gender stereotypes and spread the importance of an increasingly integrated technical-scientific culture and humanistic dimension. These STEM awareness and orientation initiatives involved nearly 10,000 high school students in 2022 (over 30,000 students in the last 6 years);\n- career counseling: conversations on specific topics to increase awareness of third- and fourth-year high-school students when choosing what to study and which job to look for, together with shadowing meetings, i.e., working days spent alongside a professional to begin to understand how the working environment works and what is the language used, and the opportunities offered by STEM courses. For more details please refer to the chapter \u201cEmpowering Enel people\u201d.\n\n### Suppliers | Supporting change\n\nSuppliers are an essential partner in the journey to decarbonization.\n\nIn this sense, the actions we have in place aim, on the one hand, at supporting their increased resilience and, on the other, to minimize pressure on critical materials and components through continued technology innovation and recycling.\n\nThat is why we work jointly with them to develop new performance metrics and to promote co-innovation projects to support decarbonization and circular economy approaches, that will all have positive impacts on their production processes and on the purchasing methods.\n\nAmong such initiatives:\n\n- we set increasingly challenging emission targets in tender processes that also factor in the contribution of innovation. These targets are shared with our suppliers and are in line with a 1.5\u00b0C roadmap;\n- we promote a circular supply approach through the adoption of various initiatives and mechanisms that allow us to quantify, certify and communicate objectively the environmental impacts generated throughout the life cycle of the supplies (for core categories we require the Environmental Product Declaration \u2013 EPD);\n- we require information about the country of origin and the quantities of each material composing the product, including recycled and recyclable material. This allows us to reward suppliers based on their recycling capabilities thus stimulating a circular culture and meeting the increasing demand for supply chain transparency and traceability aimed at minimizing potential ESG impacts of some products production processes in terms of human rights violations, bribery, water use, air pollution, CO\u2082 emissions and loss of biodiversity.\n\nWe have also worked on several initiatives to walk the talk in terms of supporting business reconversion and diversification:\n\n- Supplier Development Program, initially launched in Italy (where it is currently open to over 6,000 suppliers) and being extended to other countries of presence, which places a specific focus on SMEs operating in strategic sectors that will benefit from our direct support for an easier access to services such as liquidi-\n\n---\n\n(5) Core categories are the ones strategic for the business, and include wind turbines, smart meters, photovoltaics, transformers, street lighting, smart home solutions, storage systems.\n\n(6) Document describing the environmental impacts related to the production of a specific quantity of product or service: for example energy consumption and raw materials, waste production, emissions into the atmosphere and discharges into water bodies.\nty sources, management and technical training programs to encourage their business requalification to serve the energy transition, advice on sustainability, circular economy, strategy, M&A and internationalization, access to catalogues of means of transport and work machines, certificates;\n\n\u2022 \u201cSportello imprese\u201d (business counter), which consists in meeting periodically with companies belonging to the traditional energy production sector to support their growth and requalification in areas such as renewables or new services related to energy efficiency;\n\n\u2022 courses focusing on the reskilling/upskilling of workers connected to jobs that risk disappearing, on fostering entrepreneurship and strengthening the Italian productive and economic fabric, such as:\n  - Digital Management Program: an initiative aimed at stimulating and encouraging businesses digital development. Our Digital Innovation Hub of Lazio has collaborated to developing a project of consolidation and growth of managerial skills of leading companies in the region. The training, that took place in 2022, was held after an initial stage of assessment instrumental to raise awareness about digital skills and improving them. The project has then given rise to the Digital Management Program which, in 2022, involved 20 companies of the local territory for a total of 24 hours of training provided by Luiss Business School;\n  - courses for photovoltaic panel installers: during 2022, we launched the initiative also in Brindisi. It aims at requalifying local suppliers training them so that they can work in solar photovoltaic plants building sites. This activity builds on what was done in 2021 for Civitavecchia and Montalto di Castro suppliers involved in the Alto Lazio energy transition and that have decided to requalify their business in order to be able to work in the renewables field;\n\n\u2022 \u201cEnergie per Crescere\u201d (Energy for Growth), a program launched at the end of 2021 with the aim of training about 8,200 new technicians, including 5,500 by 2023, creating highly requested professional profiles in the electricity sector (cable pullers, cable splicers, substations assemblers, live-line workers) to be hired by Enel grids partner companies; the remaining 2,700 technicians will be trained and hired by 2025 and the training will focus on renewable profiles for partner companies (electrical specialists, junior site managers, civil-mechanical specialists). During 2022, some 2,100 new technicians were trained and recruited from grids suppliers;\n\n\u2022 \u201cEnergie per la Scuola\u201d, a program for final year students attending technical and vocational schools with the aim of training them for the \u2018most wanted\u2019 roles in the electricity sector so that, after graduation, they can be hired by Enel\u2019s suppliers. The first edition of the program (school year 2020/2021) involved 11 schools, 8 suppliers of e-distribuzione and a total of some 100 students who were all hired by Enel\u2019s suppliers at the end of the training. The second edition, aimed at 2022/2023 school year students, is currently underway and it involves over 60 schools and some 500 students.\n\nFor full details, please refer to \u201cSustainable supply chain\u201d.\n\nMoreover, also in 2022 we have promoted employment stability in Italy thanks to the application of the so-called \u201csocial clause\u201d in our purchasing procedures. Such clause mandates a supplier taking over another in the provision of the same service to ensure continuation of the employment of the persons employed by the former supplier. This allowed 3,700 people to keep their job.\nOur efforts also go in the direction of supporting a greater diversification of the supply chain of key technologies for the transition, like for solar PV. This is the case of 3SUN, our PV modules producing factory in Catania, Sicily which is a European leader in the manufacturing of innovative bifacial cells and panels. The planned capacity expansion (from the current 200 MW to roughly 3,000 MW per year by 2024) will involve an investment of around 600 million euros and the creation of direct and indirect jobs. For further details, please refer to \u201cClean electrification\u201d.\n\nCommunities | Creating shared value\n\nOur commitment to support communities goes through initiatives that promote inclusion (with particular attention to people in conditions of physical, social and economic vulnerability) both in terms of access to local working opportunities and to facilitating access to products and services. These initiatives, as specified in the chapter \u201cEngaging communities\u201d, are the result of solid and lasting relationships that include a broad, inclusive and continuous dialogue based on clearly defined phases of \u201cStakeholder engagement\u201d in line with international reference standards. We have, for example, put in place many projects focusing on digitalization to support connectivity in rural areas, computer literacy, as well as to encourage the participation of women in STEM subjects. These include the following:\n\n- **Lethbridge College (Alberta, Canada) \u2013 partnership for wind engineers**\n  Support to the training program for wind turbine engineers and involvement of students belonging to the Piikani Nation community (indigenous population of the Alberta region, Canada).\n  The partnership creates opportunities for STEM education and access to the world of work for indigenous and other students living in the areas of influence of several of our wind farms in the southern part of the province.\n\n- **Ruta Pehuenche (Maule Region, Chile) \u2013 program for the growth of local small entrepreneurs**\n  Engagement with the local community of the area of influence where the construction of the Los C\u00f3ndores hydroelectric plant is underway has generated educational and working opportunities, with the birth of a micro-entrepreneurial fabric led by women.\n  The project was born with the twofold objective of promoting the economic growth of the whole community, through training courses, and improving living conditions, thanks to the use of environmentally friendly technologies for water supply, for the cultivation of food, for the construction of housing, for access to energy and for sanitary facilities. In the four years since the start, more than 80 participants attended the courses, including 70 women.\n\n- **\u00c8 viva la scuola, Helpcode (Italy)**\n  In partnership with Helpcode, the project aims at supporting educational institutions in their activities, by integrating training contents and strengthening curricular teaching, with the additional aim of increasing the awareness of children on issues of topical importance for Enel such as the energy transition, digitalization and human rights. The project also provides specific training for teachers.\n  For more details, please refer to \u201cSustainability projects and initiatives\u201d in the chapter \u201cEngaging communities\u201d.\n\n---\n\n**Suppliers**\n\n- **8,200 people** involved in training aimed at new technical profiles to be hired in supply chain companies\n- **5,500 people** for grids, of which 2,100 have been already trained and employed (full achievement by 2023)\n- **2,700 people** for renewables (full achievement by 2025)\nCustomers | Empowering the transition\n\nEnergy and digital technologies are key enablers for empowering consumers through new services, better insights and more control.\n\nThe first stone that must be laid is a smart meter. This is a piece of technology that allows customers to access their own consumption data more easily, increasing awareness of their energy use habits and encouraging behaviors that are more efficient and sustainable. It also enables personalized electricity rates that are better suited to different consumer habits, with dynamic and highly flexible pricing.\n\nRecently improved technology also makes it possible to integrate energy consumption monitoring with smart home management systems for electrical appliances, boilers, air conditioners and lights. Finally, it facilitates real time monitoring of self-produced energy from users\u2019 own distributed generation systems, like photovoltaics and or batteries.\n\nThe second step is putting the increasing number of connected home devices (home appliances, mobile technology, heat pumps and EVs) to the best to manage energy use. Energy suppliers and service providers can help consumers use the power of new technology by designing easy-to-use services and offers that reduce complexity and costs while increasing control and gaining new revenues (sale of the excess self-produced electricity or of unutilized available power capacity) and keeping technology innovation and evolution always in the radar to always provide the most effective and relevant solutions.\n\nAffordability of green technologies whether EVs, solar PVs, batteries or heat pumps is a relevant barrier, especially for low-income and vulnerable customers who are already affected by a low spending capacity for primary energy uses and who might be the ones to benefit the most from adopting them.\n\nThe enormous amount of data created by the growing role of connected devices offers a great opportunity to engage customers in the transition with tailored solutions but data security and privacy shall be preserved and transparency about how data is being used and shared must also be ensured with simple terms and conditions.\n\nFor further details, please refer to \u201cClean electrification\u201d and \u201cManaging human rights\u201d chapters.\nBelow the 2022 results related to the targets of the previous 2022-2024 Sustainability Plan, the resulting progress and the targets of the 2023-2025 Sustainability Plan, which may be redefined, added to, or surpassed with respect to the previous Plan.\n\n| SDG | Activities | 2022 results | Progress | 2023-2025 targets | Tag |\n|-----|------------|---------------|----------|-------------------|-----|\n| 5   | Women in selection processes (%)\\(^{(1)}\\) | 52.2% | \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf | 50.0% | S |\n| 5   | Women managers\\(^{(2)}\\) and middle managers (%) | 24.9% managers 32.6% middle managers 31.8% managers and middle managers | \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf | 26.9% managers\\(^{(3)}\\) 34.1% middle managers\\(^{(4)}\\) 33.4% managers and middle managers\\(^{(5)}\\) | S |\n| 5   | Women in managerial Succession Plans (%) | 46.1% | \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf | 46.0% | S |\n| 5   | Women in Top Manager Succession Plans (%) | 50.0% | \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf | 45.0% | S |\n| 5   | Female students involved in STEM career guidance initiatives | 9,887 female students involved | \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf | 19,200 female students involved in the period 2023-2025 | S |\n| 5   | Climate survey - Open Listening (%) | 100% people involved\\(^{(6)}\\) 75.6% participants | \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf | 100% people involved\\(^{(6)}\\) 80% participants | S |\n| 5   | Open Feedback Evaluation - Performance appraisal (%) | 100% people involved\\(^{(6)}\\) 99% appraised | \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf | 100% people involved\\(^{(6)}\\) 99% appraised | S |\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) Selection processes involving blue-collar workers or similar technical roles as well as related to the USA and Canada perimeter are not included, due to local regulations that do not permit gender tracking during the recruitment phase.\n\n\\(^{(2)}\\) Including female Top Managers.\n\n\\(^{(3)}\\) The target for 2030 is 32.1%.\n\n\\(^{(4)}\\) The target for 2030 is 38.1%.\n\n\\(^{(5)}\\) The target for 2030 is 37.5%.\n\n\\(^{(6)}\\) Eligible and reachable persons: those who have a permanent contract and have been in place and active for at least 3 months during the year.\n| SDG | Activities | 2022 results | Progress | 2023\u20132025 targets | Tag |\n|-----|------------|--------------|----------|-------------------|-----|\n| 4   | Average training hours \u2018Cultural Evolution\u2019 per capita | 47.4 hours | \u2b24 \u2b24 \u2b24 | 46.5 hours | S |\n| 4   | Digital skills \u2013 Promote training on digital skills among all Enel people | 14% of training hours dedicated to develop digital skills | \u2b24 \u2b24 | 20% of training hours dedicated to develop digital skills | S T |\n| 4   | Reskilling and upskilling \u2013 Promote reskilling and upskilling programs for Enel people | 42% of training hours conducted on upskilling and reskilling | \u2b24 \u2b24 \u2b24 | 40% of training hours conducted on upskilling and reskilling | S T |\n| 4   | Development of a new culture of \u2018Human sustainability\u2019 among our people | 12% of training hours dedicated to develop human skills | \u2b24 \u2b24 \u2b24 | 10% of training hours dedicated to develop human skills | S |\n| 4   | Scholarships available for Enel people | 151 scholarships | \u2b24 \u2b24 | 390 scholarships in the period 2023\u20132025 | S |\n| 8   | Disability inclusion | Adopting a systemic approach to disability inclusion: * within the scope of the launch of a structured process to analyze the needs of Enel people with disabilities globally, the Enel WIN \u2013 Work INclusion questionnaire was revised;

Companies must therefore be able to transform themselves to adapt to operating in scenarios of high uncertainty, volatility and complexity. Acting in an inclusive manner, placing the person in his or her social and working dimensions at the center, thus becomes indispensable to cope with this epic transformation.\n\nWe are more than 65,000 people in Enel, belonging to 86 nationalities and speaking 24 languages. The success of our strategy rests precisely on our people and on a model, in place since 2015, of shared values and behavior: the \u201cOpen Power model\u201d (see \u201cEnel is Open Power\u201d).\n\nWe are committed to promoting and enhancing knowledge, relations and influence between different cultures, as well as respect for human rights. Valuing diversity and individual talents is a fundamental prerequisite for creating an inclusive corporate culture in which everyone can recognize themselves, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation and ability.\n\nWe have strengthened our people empowerment processes to support the cultural evolution of our people, focusing on their well-being, motivation, sense of responsibility and active participation. These dimensions are closely interrelated, intertwining and mutually reinforcing, enabling the full expression of each individual\u2019s potential, with a positive impact on the sense of belonging to the corporate community, fostering involvement, attractiveness and loyalty of people, and on the achievement of the Group\u2019s sustainable results.\n\nTo ensure that our people are ready to support the Group as it transitions, embracing change and adapting quickly, we promote a continuous learning experience that accompanies them throughout their personal and professional life cycles. The People and Organization Function defines organizational models and the multiannual people management plan in line with the Group\u2019s strategy. The people selection, management and development processes are governed by specific policies and procedures that apply to the global and local levels, with specific sections on the Company intranet. In order to be able to customize the offer of empowerment, facilitate all phases of personnel management (recruiting, development, training, talent management) and thus set up a decision-making process supported by objective data, the Function has equipped itself with an analysis tool, \u201cPeople Analytics\u201d which, based on quantitative metrics and related statistics and operating through platforms, allows for a real-time assessment of the different demographic clusters, and therefore also generational clusters, relevant for the Company.\n\n| 65,124 | ENEL PEOPLE |\n| 66,279 in 2021 | -1.7% |\n\n| 6,412 | NEW RECRUITS |\n| 5,401 in 2021 | +18.6% |\n\n| 23.4% | WOMEN IN THE WORKFORCE |\n| 22.5% in 2021 | +0.9% |\n\n| 24.9% | WOMEN MANAGERS |\n| (including Top Managers) | 23.6% in 2021 | +1.3% |\n\n| 47.4 | Average hours |\n| TRAINING PER EMPLOYEE | 44.5 average hours in 2021 | +6.3% |\nThe Statuto della Persona (Charter of the Person), a cultural transformation\n\n\u201cA new working ecosystem where people are at the center with their well-being, participation and dignity\u201d. This is the core of the Charter of the Person, signed in Italy on March 29, 2022 by Enel and the trade unions FILCTEM, FLAEI and UILTEC and rapidly disseminated throughout the countries and regions where the Group operates.\n\nIt is an innovative protocol that inaugurates a model of labor relations based on the involvement of the individual and the Company, valuing the person in a harmonious relationship with the surrounding world.\n\nPutting the human being at the center, taking care of his or her needs in order to enhance their uniqueness, at all stages of life: from schooling to the transmission of knowledge to future generations.\n\nA new model, conceived in the age of uncertainty par excellence, due to the Covid-19 pandemic that has in fact transformed relations in the workplace, thus also becoming an extraordinary opportunity for change, crowning a cultural journey that had already begun some time ago at Enel. In energy, digital and cultural transition processes, the person becomes the success factor, the true competitive advantage. In order to cope with the rapid changes taking place, an inclusive path is needed, all the more so in the workplace. With this in mind, the Charter of the Person aims to value the human being by making him or her the protagonist of an ecosystem in which Company and union organizations work together to create a healthy, safe, stimulating and participative working environment. An environment in which well-being, productivity, continuous learning and safety can reinforce each other, contributing to the fullest realization of the individual.\n\nThere are three areas:\n\n- **well-being, participation and productivity**, to promote the protection of dignity at work, inclusiveness, absence of prejudice, work-life balance and attention to the human element;\n\n- **knowledge and continuous learning**, a life-long learning model, with professional training and refresher courses, women\u2019s empowerment to encourage the choice of scientific subjects (STEM), the offer of apprenticeships and openness to external training contributions, including the planning of specific moments to be dedicated exclusively to self-training;\n\n- **safety culture and behavior**, especially in the workplace, with the provision of ex ante and ex post analysis of injury-risk, the identification of the most innovative technologies for accident prevention, the empowerment of workers and the strengthening of the safety culture through the involvement of the supplier network.\n\nThe Charter of the Person represents a turning point towards a virtuous mechanism of caring for relational space in the workplace, where dignity and well-being are indispensable elements. The path to sustainability undoubtedly passes through changing the production model, but also through rethinking interpersonal dynamics, ones that are more open and receptive to others. For Enel, people have always been at the forefront. This document aims not only to improve the conditions of Enel\u2019s people, but also looks outwards, to the entire ecosystem of suppliers and contractors that work with the Group, and opens a channel for dialogue with other companies to design an increasingly sustainable workplace together.\nMulti-stakeholder initiatives\n\nIn 2022, we participated in numerous initiatives and multi-stakeholder dialogues focused on social sustainability, with special reference to Enel people. Specifically:\n\n**CSR Europe**\n\nOn the topic of just transition in the context of the green and digital transformation, in which we participated in the group on \u201cworkforce\u201d, as well as those on \u201ccommunity\u201d and \u201cconsumers\u201d. We also actively participated in the workshops organized with the aim of stimulating companies to effectively develop a people-centered approach and corporate inclusion (\u201cHow companies can include care for people and well-being in the green, digital and post-pandemic transitions in their workspace\u201d), which led to the launch at the European SDG Summit of the \u201cBuilding Inclusive Workplaces\u201d blueprint, to which we contributed the \u201cGentle Leadership\u201d case study.\n\nFinally, we took part in the **Upskill 4 Future project**, focused on the employability of vulnerable workers through the promotion of upskilling and reskilling practices, contributing to the publication of the \u201cUpskilling & Reskilling Report\u201d, in which Enel\u2019s pilot project on e-distribuzione People Business Partners (PBP) is featured.\n\n**World Business Council for Sustainable Development**\n\nWe participated in the \u201cHealthy People Healthy Business\u201d project, among others, which explored the role of businesses in developing and promoting solutions to global health challenges by supporting disease prevention and health promotion. The main outcome of the project was the flagship report \u201cHealthy People, Healthy Business: How business can contribute to global health\u201d launched during the Annual Meeting of the Planetary Health Alliance. Included in the report is our people case study entitled \u201cSupporting healthier lifestyles of employees through innovative telemedicine\u201d.\n\nFor further details on initiatives related to social issues, please refer to the chapter \u201cOur commitment to a just transition: leaving no one behind\u201d.\n\nEmpowering Enel people\nAttracting new talent\n\nThe 2022 global recruitment plan focused on tapping key roles to manage the challenge to the energy transition, capable of supporting the three main business drivers\u2014renewables, electrification of consumption, and digitalization of networks, and interpreting both new consumer needs and the dynamics of business developments to ensure increasingly sustainable energy use. There was a special focus on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) and the search for more inclusive ways of attracting talent.\n\nMore than 6,400 people(1) joined the Group in 2022, enhancing an ongoing commitment to relations with universities and to holding Recruiting Days globally, as a model of candidate engagement in relation to the various positions to be filled.\n\nTo support the selection process, we have defined several initiatives, digital and otherwise, aimed at building a corporate identity that is attractive to potential candidates and includes the transmission of our values.\n\nAmong the main initiatives are:\n\n- the launch of the Talent Engagement Program, a selection process targeting talents from the most prestigious international universities aimed at ensuring a transversal development and growth path within the different areas of the Company;\n- the \u201cA day as a colleague\u201d campaign, aimed at fostering full external knowledge of the Company\u2019s different professions, through the amplification on social channels of \u201ca typical day as a colleague\u201d with its operational activities, relations with co-workers, the story of its shared passions and how these often dovetail into everyday work;\n- specific advertising campaigns targeted at increasing the visibility of job offers, especially with a view to gender equality and full inclusiveness, launched during 2022 to support specific recruiting needs and which saw a positive engagement rate;\n- a complete restyling of the \u201cCareers\u201d section of the enel.com website, aimed at improving candidate engagement thanks to an optimized user experience and access to content providing a complete overview of the Company and a more user-friendly consultation of the various vacancies in the Group;\n- a new system (Avature) launched in November 2022 for the global collection and management of all internal and external applications, central to a data-driven strategy of the selection process.\n\nIn addition, all our brand pages were integrated into the Enel Group\u2019s, in order to optimize its positioning on the main external talent attraction platforms, such as LinkedIn, Indeed and Glassdoor, and to ensure an integrated strategy for all candidates.\n\nIn 2022, the New Onboarding Global Platform was launched, a unique, comprehensive and inclusive platform for new hires around the world, with the objective of making all cultural and organizational content accessible to them for their full inclusion in the Company.\n\nIn order to ensure the direct, open and transparent involvement of every person in the Group in the selection and development processes, the \u201cReferral Program\u201d for the search of talent through two pathways was also active in 2022:\n\n- external: everyone in Enel can provide support to identify people in the \u201coutside world\u201d who might become new colleagues;\n- internal: once a year, it is possible to recommend a colleague for advancement in their professional development.\n\nOver 14,000 reports were made during 2022.\n\nFinally, mobility at work was enhanced again in 2022, enabling people to open up to new professional challenges, facilitating the diversification of competencies, and creating increasingly horizontal profiles. In order to promote people centricity, increasing attention has been paid to the e-profile tool as an opportunity to enhance a person\u2019s hard and soft skills, aspirations and motivations for change.\n\nIn 2022, the internal job posting tool was also opened to the Group\u2019s new management positions in order to promote full global participation of the entire corporate population.\n\n---\n\n(1) Fixed-term contracts are used to a limited extent, to cope with peaks in activity or to temporarily replace workers on prolonged leave (e.g., maternity/paternity leave, etc.) and provide for salaries equal to those of permanent workers.\nContinuous learning to encourage our people to participate in cultural evolution\n\nThe participation of people in the cultural and systemic transition associated with the decarbonization of the economy and digitalization, which requires new skills, professionalism, and flexibility of adaptation, necessitates the provision of a continuous learning experience that accompanies them throughout their personal and professional life cycle on a \u201ccircular path\u201d, beginning with the school life cycle on a \u201cjob shadowing\u201d, and ending with the application of neuroscience aimed at Top Managers, which also included an in-depth look at the biases related to managerial skills and female leadership;\n\n- Job Shadowing, Mentoring and Coaching, for raising awareness and expressing talents. The courses conducted enabled people to increase their network of relationships, exchange ideas and points of view and fostered self-learning, inter-culturalism and the sharing of experiences and skills. In particular, Mentoring, which is based on the sharing of soft skills and the generosity of mentors who provide less experienced colleagues with a role model, stories of successes and failures, saw the involvement of around 670 people globally in 2022;\n\n- the adoption of the \u201cLearning Time\u201d provided for in the \u201cCharter of the Person\u201d, which will allow our people to set aside moments for training only, in which they can devote themselves to skills development, personal growth or participation in community empowerment initiatives;\n\n- training initiatives involving Enel people in the role of \u201cInternal Trainers\u201d and which in the last year saw more than 500,000 hours delivered with an average of about 8 hours per person;\n\n- the global \u201cTrain the Trainers\u201d project, which aims to identify new trainers and strengthen their role within our corporate culture, making it global and sustainable over time, enhancing talent and increasing the effectiveness of training. In 2022, four training sessions involving about 100 in-house Italian trainers were organized, and new sessions will be delivered in Italy and globally in 2023.\n\nAnother strategic pillar for Enel, also present in the Charter of the Person, concerns \u201cretraining and professional updating, up/reskilling, self-learning and knowledge transfer\u201d. In order to support the green and digital transition, enhance innovation, economic growth, promote economic and social inclusion and ensure quality employment, the various Schools & Academies have disseminated programs for upgrading existing skills to access more advanced career paths (upskilling) and learning new skills (reskilling), also enhancing transversal and soft skills. These pathways were also implemented in collaboration with university and academic partners.\n\nDuring 2022, the cost dedicated to training was approximately 30 million euros, with an average cost per employee of 455 euros; training involved 96% of the population with more than 3.1 million hours dedicated to cultural\nevolution (up from around 2.9 million hours in the previous year), amounting to more than 47 average hours per capita (over 44 average hours per capita in 2021). Of these, hours dedicated to up/reskilling amounted to more than 1.3 million, or about 42% of the total, while those dedicated to human skills amounted to about 380,000, or 12%.\n\nIn 2022, the process of evolution towards a new training model led to the adoption of a more flexible, high-frequency and continuous type of delivery, in different thematic areas, based on micro-learning, which made it possible to provide more courses and thus involve more people. On the other hand, this strategy led to a decrease in the number of total training hours in some areas, due to the short duration of the courses and the already high general level of specialization, such as in the case of digital skills, for which 430,000 hours were provided (14% of the total training hours), which is lower than the targets planned for 2022 (20%).\n\nDigital skills for the new generations and to promote multiculturalism and inclusion\n\nLearning through play: the CODY PROJECT\n\nThere is no sustainable development without quality education that is inclusive and equitable in ensuring continuous learning. Sustainable development today is inseparable from digital transformation, and it is within this framework that the subject of technology also becomes an educational tool at the service of training and promotes learning that is customized to contexts and needs, starting with young students.\n\nThe Enel Cody Robot Adventure initiative, in partnership with the multi-channel community-driven developer platform Codemotion, was created precisely to help prepare students for future challenges as key players in the digital transformation. Enel Cody Robot Adventure is in fact an online educational game made of challenges that, through gamification, accompanies children and young people to learn coding, logic concepts, computational thinking, sequencing and problem solving in a simple and interactive way. The logic behind the Enel Cody Robot Adventure is that of visual coding through the block programming system: each participant can intuitively solve the challenges set, learning while having fun. The aim is therefore to get children and young people interested in some digital skills that are essential for their future, such as robotics and programming, stimulating curiosity and creativity, while discovering the main aspects of the Company\u2019s strategy and values.\n\nPOWERCODERS PROJECT\n\nFor us, diversity is a value and an accelerator of knowledge sharing and intermingling of experience. It is an indispensable factor of human enrichment, before that of professional enrichment, that training triggers to accompany the energy and digital transformation process and to provide a concrete opportunity for employment for the most vulnerable.\n\nIt was with this conviction, as part of the ongoing commitment to initiatives that enhance multiculturalism and digital skills, which are indispensable for the future of innovation in our ecosystem and fundamental for the realization of industrial goals and sustainable progress, that the partnership with Powercoders Italia was launched.\n\nIn 2022, Enel became part of the Powercoders Italia project, a computer programming (coding) academy for refugees. It thus became part of a network that already included Reale Foundation, Fondazione Italiana Accenture, in collaboration with UNHCR \u2013 UN Refugee Agency in Italy, which offers three-month intensive courses and placement in companies operating in the IT sector, with six-month paid internships. As of 2022, Powercoders has extended participation in training to the so-called NEETs (Not in Education, Employment or Training).\n\nUnderlying the project is the desire to promote cultural diversity and meet the labor market\u2019s need for digital profiles with knowledge of programming languages. Bringing together people from different backgrounds and cultures, with different aptitudes and experiences, triggers creativity and innovation through an intensive and specialized training model that enables those with basic coding skills to obtain a diploma certifying that they are prepared for the workplace. This project, which\nThe training course, which ended in December and was supported and underwritten by Enel, resulted in 25 students of different nationalities (i.e., Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Syria, Ukraine, Liberia, Cameroon, India, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Bhutan and Italy) aged between 21 and 40, being awarded diplomas. Obtaining the qualification allowed the new graduates to enter the selection circuit of companies interested in digital profiles and to take advantage of job opportunities that Enel also offered. The collaboration undertaken represents a model of social innovation aimed at creating shared value through the inclusion of the most vulnerable segments of the workforce, in the conviction that it is increasingly important to help them build the necessary digital skills to seize the opportunities present in the labor market and ensure an increasingly inclusive and sustainable socio-economic development that is enriched by the contribution and qualities of everyone.\n\nValuing and enhancing our people\n\n2022 saw the widespread dissemination of the new \u201cGentle Leadership Model\u201d, which is based on the importance of combining well-being and motivation to generate sustainable results over time. In this context is included the quantitative and qualitative performance appraisal process for 2022, which involved, as always, the people of the Group at different levels, in a process of constant exchange and comparison that shifts the focus toward the organizational network as a model of growth and self-empowerment, as opposed to a hierarchical model.\n\nThe global evaluation model is the Open Feedback Evaluation (OFE), which encourages constant listening and exchange of feedback on skills acted upon and results achieved, all aimed at enhancing everyone\u2019s talent to build a constructive, transparent and no-stone-unturned exchange between people, networks and managers, in full compliance with the Code of Ethics.\n\nThe program, which has involved 100% of the Group\u2019s eligible people, comprises three interdependent dimensions, with three discussion meetings between managers and employees over the course of the year:\n\n- **Talent**, consisting of highlighting one\u2019s individual skills based on the 15 Soft Skills Model and linked to the 4 Open Power values of Trust, Responsibility, Innovation and Proactivity;\n- **Generosity**, intended as the propensity to enter into relationships with others, dedicating time to acknowledging talent and getting involved in turn, requesting feedback proactively, thus generating a mechanism of individual and collective growth;\n- **Action**, i.e. the ability, as assessed by managers vis-\u00e0-vis their staff, to achieve professional goals based on objectives assigned by the manager or proactively self-proposed by the staff themselves.\n\nWith a view to increasingly enhancing the value of the individual, 2022 saw the transition from the system based on assessment for access to managerial positions to the development of an empowerment path that supports people in becoming aware of their talents, skills, aptitudes, orientations and aspirations, supporting them in the most complex organizational roles. In this context, new selection criteria were introduced in the annual succession plan for management positions, aimed at including and enhancing diversity. In particular, the age limit for access to the succession plan has been removed, and a criterion was introduced to ensure a fair representation of women among the successors, and the inclusion of white collar was encouraged.\n\n---\n\n(2) Eligible and reachable: those who have a permanent contract and were employed and active in the relevant evaluation period during the three periods of 2022.\nListening and dialogue\n\nEnel has always been keen to promote initiatives aimed at listening to Group employees. At the end of 2022, a new wave of Open Listening was launched, a global listening channel aimed at surveying the corporate climate periodically throughout the year. 75.6% of the Group\u2019s employees responded to the 2022 survey, providing useful insights into their mood, well-being and job satisfaction through constant listening on issues relevant to the Group (including work-life balance, networking, training, diversity and inclusion), with an overall job satisfaction (engagement) rate of 89.6% of those involved.\n\nConstant listening aims to put people at the center of the Group\u2019s strategy, which increasingly uses analytics to respond to different needs with targeted action plans. Other listening initiatives were carried out in relation to well-being and disability (see section \u201cThe value of uniqueness and care\u201d of this chapter).\n\nAnother essential element in listening to and engaging our people are the People Business Partners, figures dedicated to listening and dialogue with people, able to grasp individual aspirations and integrate them with the organization\u2019s needs.\n\nFinally, Enel considers internal communication a mainstay in the creation of corporate culture, people growth and the growth of the organization, stimulating and promoting the exchange of information, know-how and experience. Internal communications are also the main vector to disseminate the Enel strategy and the objectives identified for the near future. In this regard, the periodic \u201cStrategic alignment tracking\u201d survey, an additional listening tool used to monitor employee sentiment and understand their level of knowledge with regard to specific projects targeted at them, showed that, among the internal projects aimed at developing and improving employee well-being and quality of work, employees give the highest priority to the following:\n\n- People caring and well-being;\n- Job opportunity;\n- Innovation and personal entrepreneurship.\n\nWith regard to Enel\u2019s projects and initiatives that contribute to the improvement of the communities in which the Company is present, the following are those considered by employees to be the most important to pursue:\n\n- Customer centricity;\n- Contributing to the SDGs;\n- Technological innovation.\n\nThe value of uniqueness and care\n\nAt Enel, inclusion, well-being, participation and value creation are closely linked, as also indicated in the Charter of the Person (see the box in this chapter). In fact, inclusion means enhancing and expressing the unique mix of talents, skills, aptitudes, visible and invisible aspects of each of our people, so as to ensure well-being and motivation, bringing out the unexpressed potential within the organization and thus contributing to growth. This is possible through actions that spread the culture of inclusiveness at all levels of the organization and act on the enhancement of individual specificities, the uniqueness of the person and care in life situations that impact on work by creating awareness, relationships and participation.\n\nThe steps of inclusion in Enel\n\nThe steps leading to the current state begin in 2013 with the publication of the Policy on Human Rights, followed in 2015 by Enel\u2019s adherence to the seven Women\u2019s Empowerment Principles (WEP) promoted by UN Global Compact and UN Women and the simultaneous publication of the Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Policy. This policy makes explicit the principles of non-discrimination, equal opportunities, dignity, work-life balance and inclusion of every person, beyond all forms of diversity. 2019 also saw the addition of the Workplace Harassment Policy, which introduced the themes of respect, integrity and individual dignity in the workplace in the prevention of all types of harassment, principles that were the basis of the Statement against Harassment in the workplace, published on Enel\u2019s website in 2020. In 2021,\nthe Global Digital Accessibility Policy was issued to ensure equal access to digital information and systems. Governance on the issues of uniqueness and people care is entrusted to a dedicated unit at Holding level, namely, People Care and Diversity Management, which has the task of defining and implementing initiatives at global level, ensuring the coordination and monitoring of local events and the sharing of best practices. At the local level there are also specific \u201cEqual Opportunity Committees\u201d in Italy and Spain, in which the social partners also participate, which contribute to the identification of needs and the proposal of solutions on inclusion issues, while in Colombia, Peru, and Mexico there are specific Diversity & Inclusion Committees that direct and monitor activities on D&I issues.\n\nThe growing focus on these issues is also evidenced by the activation of alliances and collaborations with the external ecosystem of associations and networks, which are committed to supporting companies and institutions. In many countries, there are active partnerships with international organizations that operate in different countries and regions or are in the process of internationalization.\n\nIn 2022, Enel actively participated in the D&I round tables of the Business Commission to Tackle Inequality coordinated by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the Business for Inclusive Growth, the partnership between OECD and the coalition of CEOs of companies united by their commitment to tackle inequality of income and opportunity.\n\nOn cross-cutting issues, for example, Italy and Brazil are part of the UN Global Compact Network, Italy is associated with Fondazione Sodalitas and is a signatory of the EU Diversity Charter, while Brazil collaborates on equity and human rights with the Ethos Institute.\n\nOn gender issues, Brazil, Costa Rica and Colombia are signatories of the WEP (Women Empowerment Principles). Colombia is certified Equipares, the USA and Canada are active in the Target Gender Equality Network and the Women\u2019s Energy Network, while Italy has participated in the Target Gender Equality Accelerator round tables.\n\nIn terms of LGBTQ+ rights, Chile and Mexico are associated with Pride Connection and Italy with Parks Liberi e Uguali, the USA and Canada are affiliated with the Human Rights Campaign, while to promote the attraction of young talent Guatemala is associated with the South American Employees for Youth network.\n\nEnel also supports the internationalization of local associations and networks: in Italy, for example, it participates in inter-company working groups to expand the scope of action of Valore D, of which it is a founding member, and of the Ellis Consortium, which supports the Italian national education system in the training of young people with specific attention to girls and their access to STEM professions.\n\nNetworks and/or communities within the Group (Employee Resource Groups \u2013 ERG) on various topics related to inclusion and diversity are growing:\n\n- **inclusion**: the \u201cComunidad de inclusi\u00f3n\u201d in Spain;\n- **gender**: \u201cYin Yang\u201d in Mexico, \u201cWomen in Leadership\u201d in Chile, \u201cWomen in Energy\u201d in Peru, \u201cHer Community\u201d in Greece, \u201cThe Ladies\u2019 Room\u201d for the Enel X European countries, \u201cWomen EmPower\u201d in the United States and Canada, \u201cgender community\u201d in Brazil, \u201cPower Her\u201d in Spain, \u201cWill \u2013 Women innovation lab\u201d in Chile;\n- **disability**: the global \u201cDisability community network\u201d dedicated to the focal points for disability, the \u201cComunidad de inclusi\u00f3n\u201d in Spain, the \u201cDisability community\u201d in Italy, the \u201cAnne Sullivan\u201d in Mexico and the \u201cPeople with Disability community\u201d in Brazil;\n- **ethnicity & cultural diversity**: \u201cEthnicity Community\u201d in Brazil, \u201cChontalli\u201d and \u201cExpat network\u201d in Mexico, \u201cCultural Power\u201d in the United States and Canada;\n- **LGBTQ+**: \u201cJust Be\u201d in Mexico, \u201cUn equipo con orgullo\u201d in Chile, \u201cLGBTQ+ community\u201d in Spain, \u201cPride in Power\u201d in the United States and Canada, \u201cLGBTQ+ community\u201d in Brazil;\n- **age**: \u201cBeyond Generations\u201d in Mexico, \u201cGenerations community\u201d in Brazil;\n- **care**: \u201cParenting\u201d in Mexico;\n- **veterans**: \u201cProud To Serve\u201d in the United States and Canada;\n- **well-being**: \u201cEmpowerment and Balance\u201d in the United States and Canada.\n\n### An evidence-based inclusive culture\n\nSpreading the culture of inclusion at Enel also means measuring and setting precise targets. That is why an essential part of our work is dedicated to turning phenomena into numbers and driving change from an analysis thereof. In 2022, the People Care and D&I dashboard was implemented, allowing stakeholders to gain visibility into outcomes and trends to guide strategies.\n\nIt represents an approach to the individual that is embodied in the definition of a specific diversity policy regarding the composition of the Board of Directors and specific objectives and actions published in the Plan and in the Sustainability Report, approved by the corporate bodies. Specifically:\n\n- carry out an assessment of the general level of inclusion;\n- balance the percentage of women in selection processes;\n- increase the representation of women managers and middle managers and that of women in management succession plans;\n- increase the number of female students involved in STEM awareness initiatives;\n\n---\n\n(4) In 2018, the Board adopted a specific \u201cDiversity Policy of the Board of Directors of Enel SpA\u201d: https://www.enel.com/content/dam/enel-com/documenti/investitori/governance/statuto-regolamenti-politiche/en/diversity-policy-of-the-board-of-directors.pdf.\n\u2022 promote projects for the inclusion of Enel people with disabilities at all stages of the employee journey;\n\u2022 promote the dissemination of a bias-free culture, inter-culturally sensitive initiatives and flexible forms of working arrangements.\n\nThe proven commitment and transparency to gender inclusion has been confirmed by Enel\u2019s presence in major ESG rankings, ratings, and indices (see the chapter \u201cWe empower sustainable progress\u201d):\n\u2022 inclusion for the fourth time of the Group and its subsidiaries Endesa and Enel Chile in Bloomberg\u2019s Gender Equality Index, which recognized in particular innovative practices in terms of gender diversity, conciliation and harassment prevention;\n\u2022 confirmed for the fourth consecutive year as being among the top 100 companies, and first Italian company, of Equileap\u2019s Gender Equality Global Report & Ranking for promoting gender diversity, well-being, work-life integration and ensuring a working environment that respects human rights and is free from harassment;\n\u2022 confirmed in the Refinitiv Diversity and Inclusion Index, ranked first in the industry grouping \u201cElectric Utilities and Independent Power Producers\u201d and 30th in the top 100 for initiatives in terms of gender diversity, disability and work-life balance.\n\nAt national level, Spain was awarded the \u201cDistintivo de Igualdad\u201d en la Empresa by the Ministry of Equal Opportunities, the \u201cDistintivo de Igualdad\u201d award by the \u201cClub de Excelencia en Sostenibilidad\u201d and received the Pioneras IT award by the College of Telecommunications Engineers for STEM promotion initiatives. In addition, Mexico once again received the Distintivo \u201c\u00c9ntrale\u201d for initiatives implemented for the inclusion of people with disabilities; Enel North America for the second time, and the Enel Group for the first time, were also included in the Disability Equality Index.\n\nUniqueness that makes the difference\n\nAt Enel, the evolution of the culture of inclusion has been supported over the years by intensive communications and awareness-raising at every level and in every organizational context.\n\nEach year, a specific theme has been developed that has inspired both the campaigns and the numerous events held. In 2022, the concept of the uniqueness of the individual in its relational and organizational dimensions was explored with the global event YOUUniqueness makes the difference. The dissemination of awareness-raising campaigns on the issues of bias and harassment also continued with the delivery of the two global courses:\n\u2022 Beyond Bias, an educational initiative that promotes awareness of the main prejudices we may encounter in the working environment, through ironic and surreal sketches that indicate possible avenues of escape to avoid falling into the trap. As of 2022, the course is assigned to the entire Company population and has seen the involvement of more than 33% of assignees and about 26% of managers and top managers;\n\u2022 Harassment in the Workplace explores, in fictional form, four realistic cases of harassment related to age, disability, LGBTQ+ and sexual discrimination, in various types of conduct (visual, verbal, disparaging). The course illustrates Enel\u2019s Global Harassment Policy by providing hints for recognizing cases of harassment and indicating preventive behavior. As of 2022 it is delivered to the entire corporate population and has seen the involvement of more than 32% of the assignees.\n\nOn the other hand, at Country level, there are several initiatives for the prevention of harassment, such as Chile\u2019s \u201c#RespetarEsEnerg\u00eda\u201d campaign.\n\nThe power of intergenerationality\n\nThe dimension of intergenerationality is an increasingly central and relevant issue for companies and institutions, and the exchange of skills and experience is indeed a key element for value creation.\n\nThis is why the global People EngAger project was conceived. It introduces a resource recognized and certified by the Company with the aim of supporting the evolution process in the organization both in the phase of new hires and in the internal mobility between functions, business areas and countries where the Group maintains a presence. This resource enables intergenerational exchange by stimulating dialogue on values, experiences and skills, ensuring the ability to navigate the complexity of the context independently and acquire rapidly the knowledge associated with the role.\n\nSeveral initiatives have been developed on the subject in different countries:\n\u2022 Italy: led the webinar \u201cGenerations Included\u201d which explores the diversity of each generation and its biases, with the aim of creating cross-generational collaboration networks;\n\u2022 Spain: continues with the \u201cNuestros mayores valores\u201d initiative to recognize the talent of more experienced colleagues;\n\u2022 Chile: launched communication campaigns for the International Youth Day and International Day of Older Persons with the aim of generating intrinsic motivation based on sharing between seniors and juniors;\n\u2022 Mexico: organized a training webinar on personal finance for millennials;\n\n(5) Except for the USA and Canada where courses required by local regulations are provided.\n\u2022 **Peru**: with the \u201cDiversidades\u201d initiative, it created specific workshops with the aim of promoting multi-generational talent within the organization;\n\n\u2022 **Brazil**: implemented initiatives to strengthen integration without age discrimination, through activities such as the \u201cMi experiencia Enel\u201d meeting for young professionals;\n\n\u2022 **US**: \u201cDiversity, Sensitivity & Inclusion in the Workplace\u201d course was launched in 2022 with a focus on age discrimination as well as gender, disability and LGBTQ+;\n\n\u2022 **Colombia**: conducted training sessions for trainees and apprentices on personal skills and branding held by colleagues and launched the \u201cPotential Talent\u201d project, which promotes customized development paths for young talents.\n\n**LGBTQ+ uniqueness**\n\nLGBTQ+ issues are receiving increasing attention internationally, and many Group countries have promoted measures, awareness-raising and training initiatives, and communication campaigns to reflect on inclusive language, shed light on stereotypes and explore specific aspects of people\u2019s lives.\n\nAmong the specific measures, in addition to the parental leave, already recognized, in 2022 **Italy** extended to same-sex couples in civil marriages the system of protections and facilities for parental and care purposes (parental leave for childcare, leave and absences recognized for parents with severely disabled children and in the event of death or serious infirmity of the child), while in **Peru** the extension of health insurance coverage to same-sex cohabiting couples is active. In **Italy** and **Chile**, the \u201cGuidelines on Gender Transition for Inclusion\u201d of colleagues in transition have also been adopted.\n\nVarious initiatives have been organized to promote the creation of a safe and inclusive working environment and to support colleagues in their role as parents, also in collaboration with external associations and networks that promote the enhancement of talent regardless of identity, gender expression and sexual orientation (Parks Liberi e Uguali in Italy, the REDI network in Spain, Pride Connection in Colombia, Chile and Mexico). In **Argentina**, webinars were organized on gender prejudice. **Italy** offered meetings targeted at all colleagues and one entitled \u201cDo I tell my parents or not?\u201d, aimed at parents with homosexual, bisexual and transgender children. The **USA and Canada** spread awareness on LGBTQ+ history and equal rights. **Brazil** has launched a number of communication campaigns and webinars to disseminate and raise awareness of the issue. **Chile** has launched an initiative aimed at the internal LGBTQ+ group and a communication campaign to raise awareness of the use of inclusive language through the #mipronombre initiative, which calls for respect for gender identities and the promotion of recognition for all, also setting up sharing spaces where sexual diversity can be openly discussed and ideas exchanged. **Mexico** participated in the \u201cPride Race\u201d. **Colombia** was awarded the Friendly Biz Corporate seal and produced a podcast on human rights and sexual diversity. **Costa Rica** and **Peru** respectively offered in-depth discussions on sexuality and a training program divided into 4 meetings to explore different topics related to the LGBTQ+ world.\n\n**Cultures in dialogue**\n\nWith 86 nationalities and 24 languages, Enel considers cultural and ethnic diversity to be an extraordinary asset and is committed to promoting and enhancing knowledge, relationship and intermingling among different cultures. In order to carry out a comprehensive mapping of ethnic and cultural diversity, please note that in most of the countries where we are present there are legal and privacy protection constraints that do not allow its collection, while in Argentina, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama, Mexico, Peru, South Africa, Canada, Brazil and the United States it is only possible to request such information on a voluntary basis.\n\n**Specific initiatives** in favor of intercultural diversity in its various forms have been launched in many countries:\n\n\u2022 **Italy**: the intercultural awareness webinar \u201cDifferent from whom?\u201d was organized and the project Powercoders was launched (see dedicated box);\n\n\u2022 **Brazil**: with the \u201cInclusive Estagio\u201d project, more than 30% of internship positions were filled by black candidates and days against racial discrimination were celebrated;\n\n\u2022 **Chile**: organized webinars on native cultures, dedicated an initiative for expat colleagues and celebrated Migrants\u2019 Day;\n\n\u2022 **Colombia and Central America** (Panama, Costa Rica and Guatemala): a memo was issued to promote the cultural and linguistic integration of colleagues from the four countries;\n\n\u2022 **Peru**: webinars, a podcast and a challenge on intercultural diversity were realized;\n\n\u2022 **Mexico**: produced a guide on the country, its traditions and culture for the integration of new colleagues from other countries;\n\n\u2022 **North America**: implemented awareness-raising initiatives during Black History Month and through the \u201cCultural Power\u201d ERG.\n\nAt a global level, a mentor is provided to foster the integration of expatriate colleagues in the destination countries. In addition, to train interpersonal sensitivity and communication and reduce the risk of misunderstandings in multicultural contexts, the global online course WIRED \u2013 Connecting Intercultural Skills is freely available for all colleagues on e-ducation. The course allows for reflection on the biases and coaching skills that foster intercultural inclusion and, in a specific section, offer monographic guides that explore the specificities of different cultural contexts.\nTaking action to close the gender gap\n\nEnel\u2019s efforts to close the gender gap and ensure pay equity continue with tangible results through actions and initiatives that influence all phases of women\u2019s journey in the organization: from representation at entry level to empowerment and development in positions of responsibility, paying attention to various relevant moments in life, such as becoming parents and personal or family care.\n\nGENDER GAP: the action plan, direct and indirect measures\n\nThe action plan consists of measures that directly and indirectly affect equal pay, given the fact that the gradual increase in female representation at different organizational levels is a prerequisite for natural generational exchange and thus for achieving parity in remuneration over time.\n\nEnel guarantees equal pay for equal tasks and seniority for all new managers through internal development.\n\n- The Board of Directors (BoD) of Enel SpA consists of 44.4% women.\n- At the end of 2022, women accounted for 23.4% of the Group\u2019s entire workforce, up from 22.5% in 2021.\n- In 2022, 24.9% of managers were women (23.6% in 2021) and held 15% of executive positions (CEO-1) (3 out of 20), while 32.6% of middle managers were female (31.4% in 2021).\n- By 2022, the presence of women in management succession plans was steadily increasing: 46.1% female successors in management plans and 50% in top management plans.\n- In the past year, the percentage of women in the Group working in STEM roles reached 21% compared to 18% in 2021.\n- Selection processes are closely monitored to ensure a fair balance of the two genders in the candidate pools, with a rising trend in the last five years (52.2% in 2022 compared to 39.0% in 2018).\\(^7\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^6\\) Women working in managerial roles (managers and middle managers) in revenue-generating business areas account for 28.3% of the total number of people in these areas, up from 23.3% in the 2021 Report.\n\n\\(^7\\) Selection processes involving blue-collar workers and similar technical roles are not included (as of 2021), nor is the US and Canadian perimeter, due to local anti-discrimination legislation that does not allow gender monitoring at the recruiting stage.\nThe Long-Term-Incentive Plan 2022 supports these trends by confirming a performance target, with an increased weight from 5% to 10% of the total, represented by the \u201cpercentage of women in top management succession plans\u201d at the end of 2024 with the aim of giving continuity to a policy of preparing a suitable audience for managerial appointments in the near future. The processes for managing succession plans and salary reviews are governed by specific policies, and constant monitoring of remuneration for all positions is carried out. A dedicated budget has been allocated beginning 2019 to ensure equal pay for equal work, in cases where a mismatch is found.\n\nFor the purpose of monitoring equal pay, an overall maintenance of the Equal Remuneration Ratio (ERR) of 81% was noted. The calculation of the ERR, based on the aggregate average of women\u2019s wages over the average of men\u2019s wages, is influenced by the steadily increasing trend over the years in the number of women, whose shorter tenures, given their seniority in the position, go to affect the average gender remuneration in the short and medium term.\n\nTo confirm its commitment to these issues, since 2021 Enel has been participating in the \u201cEqual by 30\u201d campaign promoted by Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM), the initiative whereby various public and private sector organizations have committed to promoting gender equality in terms of pay, leadership and opportunities in the clean energy sector by 2030. Three specific commitments have been made to raising the awareness of an increasing number of girls towards STEM disciplines and professions, fair representation of women in selection shortlists, and growth in the number of women in managerial positions.\n\nAs far as the parental dimension globally there is the \u201cParental Program\u201d, which aims to promote organizational and personal awareness of the culture of parenting and to reconcile personal and professional needs related to this phase of life, which is crucial for both parental roles. The program is based on the values of trust, care and engagement, and provides for a structured process of interviews between the new parent, the manager and the People Business Partner, before and after maternity and paternity leave. The program is supported by a single information point that offers all the information, services and training initiatives relevant in facilitating a return to the Company, in supporting work-life balance, and in promoting the motivation and organization of activities. In the various countries where the Group is present, this program is complemented by further local initiatives to support parenthood.\n\nCommitment to the promotion of women\u2019s presence has been growing over the years to supporting initiatives that promote the presence of women in study and professional pathways in STEM fields, in conjunction with schools, universities and institutions, to overcome gender stereotypes and disseminate the importance of the technical and scientific culture, increasingly integrated with the humanistic dimension. These STEM awareness and orientation initiatives involved almost 10,000 female high school students in 2022 and more than 30,000 female students in the last six years.\\(^{(8)}\\)\nBack to school: Enel\u2019s first global STEM and empowerment initiative\n\n2022 saw the launch of Back to school, a global initiative involving no less than 12 countries (Spain, Italy, Greece, South Africa, India and then Colombia, Chile, Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Romania, USA and Canada) and more than 4,000 students, almost 76% of them girls. Simplicity, scalability and experiential learning are the hallmarks that have made this initiative a success story featuring 68 female STEM professionals who have returned to schools \u2013 in some cases to the very schools from which they graduated \u2013 to talk about their experiences.\n\nBack to school brings together two mutually enriching worlds. Young people in search of prospects and the awareness that will allow them to choose the educational path to forge the future they desire, and female managers whose generosity and empathy point to \u201cnew scenarios\u201d, overcoming the \u201cwalls\u201d of stereotypes and prejudices that unfortunately still limit women\u2019s access to technical and scientific faculties.\n\nThrough Back to school, students in their third and fourth year of high school have had and will have the opportunity to access career counselling, have conversations on specific topics to make their study and professional choices more informed, and have shadowing meetings, i.e. days spent working alongside a professional to begin to understand the mechanisms, the language of the workplace and the opportunities offered by STEM fields of study.\n\nIn Italy, the Back to school program also included the launch of a contest that saw a number of female students awarded financial contributions to cover university fees for enrolling in a STEM faculty.\n\n- \u201cThe empathetic relationship is the key to the success of the project because, on the one hand, it strengthens the girls\u2019 desire to emulate and, on the other, it increases the passion and generosity of the female colleagues who tell of their experience\u201d, says Silvana Ceravolo, head of Rewarding and Mobility, who is behind the project.\n- \u201cHaving an outlook on the future and work can help to overcome one\u2019s limitations and not be afraid to embark on technical paths\u201d. Gaia, Italy.\n- \u201cDuring the presentation I was very impressed. It was very different from what my classmates and I were used to, a new method of teaching\u201d. Aggeletou, Greece.\n- \u201cI want to become an engineer and this experience has offered me insights for my professional growth\u201d. Mapanzule, South Africa.\n\nIt was an important and generative experience for our colleagues as well. We gathered feedback and impressions from some of them:\n\n- \u201cIt was generative to share my knowledge and the knowledge that there are no limits\u201d, says Alisha, wind and solar plant manager.\n- \u201cTypical female skills are also needed in technical fields\u201d. Daniela, head of Spare Parts Optimization.\n- \u201cIt was nice to interact with the students and tell them that there is no such thing as male or female work\u201d, are the words of Sonia, plant supervisor.\n\nFinally, the contribution of a manager, Aurora Viola, head of Market Italy and mother of a STEM girl: \u201cThe future is called STEM, as all professions will need these skills and women cannot miss this opportunity. I tell girls not to imitate others in order to be accepted, not to be afraid of making mistakes and feel guilty about it, but always to try again. Back to school is an opportunity to break down the many stereotypes still present\u201d.\n\n226 Sustainability Report 2022\nThere are also numerous STEM initiatives implemented locally in the various countries where the Group is present. In particular, in Italy with the \u201cSTEM Lab\u201d, online introduction courses in coding have been activated for all children and young children of employees (aged 8 to 10) to support digital literacy (see the \u201cPowercoders Project\u201d box). In Colombia and Central America, we highlight the \u201cPanel de mujeres Enel sin fronteras\u201d project, in which female colleagues share the challenges, opportunities and perspectives for women working in technical contexts. In Romania, with \u201cEmpower girls\u201d, workshops were initiated with upper secondary school students to inspire and orient them towards STEM studies. In Spain, the \u201cElla te cuenta\u201d initiative continues, through webinars conducted by students who have been awarded scholarships from the \u201cFEU Institute of Technology\u201d, to stress the importance of technical skills to meet major global challenges, and the \u201cCode\u201d training project for the children of colleagues has been activated. \u201cStudents job shadowing\u201d in Brazil is an important opportunity for young female students to experience the workplace, supported by an Enel professional.\n\nNumerous initiatives have been implemented to develop women\u2019s empowerment within the organization, ranging from cultural change, managerial development and mentoring, coaching and shadowing programs to training, upskilling and reskilling. Based on the experience of the \u201cEmpowering Conversations\u201d, i.e. the dialogues of six female managers on the importance of leadership inspired by female role models, as many video clips were produced, translated into the main languages and made available on the e-learning platform for all colleagues. Through the Gender Equality and Women Empowerment (G.E.W.E.) program, a global observatory of country-led initiatives on the subject has been set up. There are more than 200 initiatives covering all stages of women\u2019s careers within the organization as well as those aimed at attracting female talent from outside. Some initiatives have been recognized as good practices and a program has been launched to extend them to different countries:\n\n- \u201cGetting to know each other\u201d, mentoring and shadowing meetings between managers and young women aimed at fostering their visibility in the organization;\n- \u201cWomENergy \u2013 Feminine Synergy\u201d, a networking event between Business Lines involving female managers and female colleagues with the aim of expanding their professional network and encouraging the increase of women in succession plans;\n- \u201cGender awareness\u201d, an initiative launched in Brazil and aimed at People Business Partners to disseminate a gender equality culture at all levels of the organization;\n- \u201cWoMen in\u201d, an initiative launched in Mexico involving focus groups composed of representative samples of the corporate population to identify actions to implement and support gender equality.\n\nThe value of disability\n\nEnel is committed to ensuring the full inclusion of every person, in line with the approach indicated by the relevant UN Convention and with the Enel Valuability\u00a9 model, according to which inclusion generates innovation and increases the possibility of attracting and valuing people by innovating processes and products. Globally, there are 2,129 colleagues with disabilities, more than 70% of whom are in Italy. Enel provides tools, services, working methods and initiatives to create an inclusive working and relational context for all, which allows work activities to be carried out in full autonomy, regardless of any disability. In particular, there is a focal point for Enel people with disabilities in all countries and 2022 saw the launch of new global initiatives, including:\n\n- activation of Inclusive Travel services to ensure accommodation and travel experience for colleagues with disabilities;\n- launch of the Inclusive Internship project with the activation of internships in Italy;\n\u2022 participation in the Generation Valuable project promoted by the Valuable500 network with the aim of spreading the culture of inclusion and empowerment of people with disabilities through mentoring meetings between talented colleagues and managers;\n\u2022 design of an awareness-raising initiative to spread knowledge of the application principles of Design for All to business processes and contexts to train an inclusive mindset throughout the corporate population and the global dissemination of guidelines to ensure the adoption of accessibility principles for the realization of e-learning content.\n\nSince 2020, most of the disability initiatives have been merged into the Value for Disability project, which is described in detail in the chapter \u201cManaging human rights\u201d.\n\nRemote working and well-being\n\nIn 2022, more than 36,000 people worked in hybrid modes, alternating between remote working and in-person activities. A transformation of the way we work already started in 2016 and has now extended on a global scale thanks to the Group\u2019s impressive technological evolution. In March 2022 in Italy, the New Way of Working (NWOW) agreement was signed with national trade unions, regulating the new remote working arrangements, canceling and replacing previous agreements and becoming fully operational from October 2022. The new agreement introduces a highly innovative system with extensive flexibility measures, providing for the alternation of on-site working days for so-called \u201chigh-synergy\u201d activities with remote working days for which a ceiling of 60% of monthly days is set aside for remote activities. There is also the possibility of requesting additional days for special situations (disabled, caregivers, parents of small children, etc.), i.e. a maximum of 40% for activities that can be partially remote, as well as organizational measures to guarantee and protect the well-being of workers and an easier work-life balance, the right to switch off, the provision of mobile connectivity for all remote workers, and the recognition of meal vouchers for remote working days. Consistent with the principles outlined in the Italian agreement on the new work model, trade union and/or individual agreements were also signed in the other main countries in which the Group is present to make hybrid work a global reality.\n\nTo date there are many flexibility measures active in different countries, as shown in the following table:\n\n| ITALY | SPAIN | ROMANIA | NORTH AMERICA | LATIN AMERICA(1) | AFRICA, ASIA, OCEANIA | EUROPE AND EURO MEDITERRANEAN AFFAIRS |\n|-------|-------|---------|----------------|------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Part time | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f |\n| Smart working | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f |\n| Telework | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f |\n| Seasonal schedule | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f |\n| Time bank | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f |\n| Flexible time | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f |\n| Short week | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f | \ud83c\udf1f |\n\n(1) Argentina (smart working); Brazil (smart working, time bank, flexible time); Chile (smart working, flexible time); Colombia (smart working, time bank, flexible time, short week); Peru (smart working, flexible time, seasonal schedule, short week); Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala (smart working, flexible time, short week, telework).\n\n(9) https://www.thevaluable500.com/update/generation-valuable.\nThe global well-being framework\n\nIn 2021, together with our people (in co-creation mode), a global well-being framework was defined, based on eight pillars that affect overall satisfaction with the centrality of people in mind, specifically considering the needs that have emerged:\n\n- **psychological well-being**, more broadly \u201cfeeling comfortable in one\u2019s own skin\u201d, involving the management of perceived stress and individual skills of stress coping;\n- **work-life harmony**, balance between working and family life, involving the management of working time and disconnection, taking due account of the person\u2019s family commitments (children, caring for elderly and/or disabled relatives);\n- **physical well-being**, intended as inspiration to take care of one\u2019s own physical health;\n- **social well-being**, intended as a sense of connection and belonging to the communities in which the person participates socially;\n- **economic well-being**, intended as a sense of satisfaction with the family\u2019s economic situation;\n- **sense of protection**, intended as a sense of security perceived by the person with respect to the occurrence of unpleasant events;\n- **ethical well-being**, intended as satisfaction with the value, meaning and purpose of the person\u2019s life;\n- **cultural well-being**, intended as \u201cfeeling encouraged to grow and learn new things\u201d.\n\nDuring 2021, the first global well-being survey was conducted with the aim of measuring the level of corporate well-being, defining the most important initiatives for people, and consolidating its global model, using a metric common to the different countries in which Enel operates, but also capable of capturing cross-cultural differences. Through the involvement of an international, heterogeneous and multicultural team, the results enabled the definition of the most important actions to be taken.\n\nSurvey 2022 saw an expanded survey on the topic of motivation declined on four factors: purpose, mastery, relationship, and autonomy.\n\nAt the end of 2022, Enel also included the public target linked to the general well-being index for the years 2023-2025 among the targets of the Sustainability Plan. This index measures the percentage of respondents fairly or very satisfied with their overall well-being (both personal and work life) and stands at 60% in the past year.\n\nWith the purpose of increasing people\u2019s well-being, the Global Wellness Program was launched, targeted at all Enel people and designed with an experience that combines physical and digital (specific \u201cMe-Wellbeing\u201d section on the Company\u2019s \u201cME\u201d portal). The program content will be expanded continuously to keep people engaged. The first release covered psychological well-being and relational and emotional intelligence, allowing people to use the following tools on a voluntary basis: anonymous self-assessment tests on their emotional, physical and social state; tools to plan meetings with colleagues aimed at improving relational well-being; a well-being advisor who allows people to exchange tips on behaviors that impact well-being; webinars on focusing skills, stress management and the importance of social relationships. To stimulate adoption of the program and a culture inspired by self-awareness of one\u2019s own level of well-being, a reward scheme has been associated for those who use the program tools on a regular basis, enabling them to have more time for themselves (well-being days) or, alternatively, pathways aimed at further increasing their level of well-being.\n\nIn order to spread the culture of well-being and offer support to colleagues with a view to work-life harmony, 2022 also saw the birth of the global bimonthly Well-being newsletter and the introduction of a new guidance resource: the Well-being Ambassador. Training of the first Italian ambassadors was completed and was commenced for the other countries.\n\nIn general, at Enel well-being is expressed in its various meanings with initiatives that also aim to increase awareness of the importance of a correct diet, through workshops and nutritional consultations, without neglecting the area of physical well-being understood as motor activity. In Italy, for example, yoga and pilates classes held on-site have been replaced and flanked by online courses and customized subscriptions with Gympass, available in several countries.\nCaring for all\n\nWe promote the value of care in all situations, including contingencies, in which a person may find themselves during their working life, and we have defined benefits and services that support work-life integration. A few examples of initiatives in the different countries where the Group maintains a presence are provided below.\n\nCaring for people\n\n\u201cMaCro@Work Caring Program\u201d. The MaCro@Work Caring Program is a global initiative launched in Italy and aimed at Enel people suffering from a chronic disease. The first step was the training and creation of the network of Heart Managers, People & Business Partners who voluntarily volunteered to support \u201cvulnerable\u201d colleagues by providing active listening and help in seeking the most appropriate solution to create an inclusive environment for the colleague and the entire work context of reference. During 2022, the project was extended to Spain, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Central America, and Romania, and in early 2023 it will be made operational with the creation of about 50 more Heart Managers globally. The project received the DNA \u2013 Difference IN Addition Award in Italy, which recognizes concrete good practices of inclusion in corporate contexts.\n\nHeLP Me: a solidarity project that has made it possible to create the first corporate network in Italy based on volunteering that connects colleagues in a situation of need, momentary or permanent, with those willing to offer their time and lend a hand.\n\nOn the subject of psychological well-being, support services were reinforced during the Covid-19 pandemic and thereafter. In particular, assistance is provided in Brazil, Italy, Spain, Peru, Romania, the USA and Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama, India, South Africa and Argentina, covering more than 95% of Enel\u2019s people. There are also several initiatives implemented on the topic of vulnerability.\n\nIn Greece, in November 2022, Enel Green Power won the Gold Award on the \u201cBreak the Stigma\u201d dimension for its initiatives to promote an open and inclusive culture of psychological well-being free of prejudice and stereotypes. Supporting took the form of workshops, specific training such as mindfulness, and ad hoc sessions to promote a holistic approach to well-being.\n\nCaring for families\n\nIn most countries active services and support are provided, including financially, for childcare and focused on motherhood, such as breast-feeding rooms at our major sites. In Italy, the \u201cMaster Care\u201d plan dedicated to caregivers in the Company is active, and there is an online family counseling service at subsidized costs, \u201cNew Parents New Energy\u201d parenting training sessions, and the MAAM-CHILD Platform that stimulates active reflection on the life parenting experience in order to capitalize on it in the work context. There were also workshops for employees\u2019 children on coding and STEM subjects. Family services such as financial support (school book bonus, contributions for kindergarten, school and university, scholarships and conventions with schools) and \u201ctime-saving\u201d services are also available, such as babysitting, care for the elderly and home support. Since 2022, a care manager service has also been active in Italy, which consists of a specialized operator who accompanies the employee caregiver in dealing with a situation of need, offering support in the choice of assistance and care services best suited to his/her requirements. Numerous initiatives have been introduced, in collaboration with the mobility manager network, to encourage sustainable travel, including bike sharing, by Enel people, including specific agreements for public transport subscriptions. Finally, all mothers and fathers of children attending primary school are granted entry permits for their children\u2019s first day of school.\n\nAlso available is the MyWelfare platform, where it is possible to convert the performance bonus into specific welfare goods and services by taking advantage of a tax and economic benefits with a 15% premium offered entirely by Enel. In 2022, to support households in coping with increasing economic hardship, utility costs could also be reimbursed through MyWelfare.\n\nSpain has a dedicated channel on the Company intranet, offering a wide variety of products and services at competitive prices, offers for leisure, training, but also the opportunity to make donations for the improvement of the living conditions of those most in need. An app can also be downloaded to access various services such as private car sharing, car cleaning and repairs, a dietician and a travel agency. Plus, at the Madrid site, a \u201cTo-Do room\u201d is available, offering services to save time that are open all day long (for example, laundry, dyeing, computer repairs, etc.), to improve work-life balance.\n\nIn Colombia, an \u00e0 la carte platform is available that offers numerous types of benefits that can be redeemed in real time according to work-life balance needs, interests or\ncurrent moment in life. During 2022, the organization\u2019s benefit model saw the \u201cMy emotional care\u201d section for psychological and physical well-being growth.\n\nIn Greece, we won the Bronz Award in 2022 for the Parents\u2019 school program, which aims to improve the work-life balance of parents with measures including psychological support and specialized training.\n\nCaring in the organization\n\nIn 2021, an analysis was carried out to harmonize the minimum duration of maternity leave within the Group. From 2022, Japan, Taiwan, Germany and Panama will therefore add to the leave required by law to reach a minimum threshold of 80 working days, as is already the case under European legislation, as required by European regulations. As in 2021 in terms of maternity leave, a similar analysis will be carried out in 2023 regarding paternity leave.\n\nIn line with the care approach and to support the parental experience, Enel offers measures in addition to the provisions of local legislation in terms of additional days of leave as well as pay, with potential benefits in the areas of work-life balance and caring for families.\n\nWith regard to maternity leave, in more than half of the Group\u2019s major countries (Argentina, Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama, United Kingdom, Ireland, Chile, Peru, New Zealand, India, Australia, Greece) and in terms of wages (in Mexico and Greece, Enel covers any pay gaps guaranteeing 100% pay, and in all other Group countries, remuneration is already 100% guaranteed according to legislative requirements). In particular, in Italy since 2021, the law requires 10 days of paternity leave to be paid at 100% of wages, even in the event of adoption. The average number of days of fully paid paternity leave in countries that account for over 80% of the global total workforce (Italy, Brazil, Spain, Argentina and Romania) is 3.7 weeks, with the minimum offered in Brazil (1 week).\n\nIn terms of parental leave, the measures on offer vary greatly from one country to another. Italy provides parental leave of 10 months, shared between the mother and father, in a child\u2019s first 12 years. If the father takes at least 3 months, the total leave rises to 11 months. The collective agreement pays a salary of 45% for the first month and 40% for the second and third months, compared to the 30% required by law for the first 6 months.\n\nIn 2021 in Italy, parental leave was extended to same-sex couples in civil partnerships who care for children, and in Peru health insurance coverage was extended to same-sex couples living together for a minimum of two years.\n\nIn Italy, it is also possible to take leave for very serious family circumstances, and to offer holidays or rest periods from a solidarity point of view (solidarity holidays) to colleagues in the same company, to help children or adolescents, parents, spouses, civil partners or common-law spouses who need constant care or in the event of very serious family or personal circumstances. As well as holidays donated by colleagues, Enel provides the same number of days of paid leave. In Spain, it is also possible to take advantage of daily flexibility adapted to the temporary needs of the worker, in the form of a temporary change in working arrangements, reductions in working hours and leave for family care.\n\n(10) See Council Directive 2010/18/EU of March 8, 2010: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/IT/TXT/?qid=1414661428912&uri=CELEX:32010L0018.\nSupplementary healthcare assistance and pension\n\nThe majority of countries where the Group maintains a presence offer supplementary health insurance policies at advantageous conditions with respect to the alternatives available on the market. In many cases, the Company provides benefits related to prevention and periodical check-ups (see the chapter \u201cOccupational health and safety\u201d). For all Italian employees and their dependent family members, in agreement with the trade unions, Enel set up the Supplementary Healthcare Provision for Enel Group Employees (FISDE) in 1997. The Provision disburses repayments and redemptions for healthcare expenses, promotes initiatives for the disabled and individuals subject to socially challenging situations (drug addiction, alcoholism, learning difficulties, psychosocial disorders) and sets up preventive medicine programs. Also in 2022, members were able to take advantage of symposia with the Italian National Council of Psychologists (CNOP) and Italian Psychoanalytic Society (SPI) for psychological support services.\n\nIn line with the FISDE solidarity principle, former Enel employees can also continue to benefit from the services offered by the Provision by continuing to pay the membership fees.\n\nStaff support measures also include the option of accessing fixed-contribution and other pension plans, such as membership of mandatory or optional schemes and the award of various types of individual benefits in services associated with post-employment benefits provision.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, 81% of employees were covered by the Enel Group pension plan. The largest pension funds are in Italy (Fopen and Fondenel), Spain and Brazil.\n\nThe level of coverage of non-salary benefits\n\nThe analysis concerned the entire Group workforce, showing a high percentage in terms of access to the main benefits.\n\n| Non-salary benefits 100% Enel countries | 2022 | 2021 | 2022 vs 2021 |\n|----------------------------------------|------|------|--------------|\n| Covid-19 insurance                     | 99%  | 100% | -1%          |\n| Life insurance                         | 89%  | 88%  | 1%           |\n| Medical insurance                      | 94%  | 93%  | 1%           |\n| Pension Fund Membership                | 81%  | 81%  | -            |\n| Additional parental measures (maternity, paternity and parental leave) | 94%  | 94%  | -            |\n| Meal allowances                        | 89%  | 86%  | 3%           |\n| Child support initiatives              | 84%  | 84%  | -            |\n| Loans                                  | 90%  | 90%  | -            |\n| Leisure and cultural initiatives       | 87%  | 91%  | -4%          |\n\n(11) Non-salary benefits are the series of goods and services provided by the Company in addition to monetary pay.\nIndustrial relations\n\nEnel complies with the labor law in force in the various countries in which it operates, with the fundamental principles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO) concerning workers\u2019 rights (freedom of association and collective bargaining, consultation, right to strike, etc.), systematically promoting discussion between employer and worker organizations and seeking a broad level of agreement and sharing of corporate strategies by employees.\n\nIndustrial relations activities on the Group level continue to be conducted in accordance with the model laid down in the Global Framework Agreement (GFA) signed by Enel in Rome in 2013 with the Italian Federations in the sector, and the global unions IndustriALL and Public Services International, and which is still recognized as a benchmark best practice for European and non-European multinationals. The agreement is based on international human rights and business principles and is inspired by the best and most advanced transnational industrial relation systems of the reference multinational groups and institutions on the international level, including the ILO. One of the particularly significant principles of the GFA is one on remuneration, whereby the minimum payment made to Group employees cannot be lower than the level established by the collective bargaining agreements and legislative and regulatory texts in the various countries in question, in line with the provisions of the ILO conventions.\n\nOn the subject of remuneration, in accordance with the relevant ILO Convention Enel is committed to respecting the principle of decent work in all countries where it operates. In addition, it continues its commitment to bridging the gender gap, promoting initiatives to reduce it, where it exists, and thus to ensure equal pay for equal work as well as transparency. The principle of equal pay is also indicated by the Group\u2019s Policy on Human Rights, which stipulates that all those who work along the entire value chain are entitled to remuneration in line with the principle of fair compensation for work, of equal pay between male and female labor for work of equal value, and of minimum wages not less than those established by collective agreements and current legislative and regulatory treatments of reference in force in different countries, as established by ILO conventions. In addition, it is also expressly provided in the Code of Ethics that upon the establishment of the employment relationship, each employee will receive accurate information relating to characteristics of the role and duties to be performed, and to regulatory and remuneration elements according to the principles set out above. This information is presented to the employee in such a way that acceptance of their position is based on an effective understanding and awareness not only of their duties, but also and above all of their rights (enshrined in the aforementioned collective agreements). As well as serving as the basis of the regularity of contracts, this approach enables us to operate fairly at all levels of the Company and in all the Countries and Regions which Enel is present.\n\nIn Enel there are no limits to freedom of association. As indicated by the GFA and the Policy on Human Rights, Enel recognizes the right of its employees to form or take part in labor organizations aimed at protecting their interests. In particular, employees may be represented, in the various generation units, by trade union organizations and other forms of representation elected in compliance with the legislation and practices in force in the countries concerned. Enel complies with the principle of trade union independence and does not interfere in any way with the organization of representation, allowing workers\u2019 representatives access to the workplaces in order to communicate with their members, in compliance with the law and the industrial relations systems in force in each country. Enel therefore recognizes as interlocutors the trade unions that represent workers in the Company, in compliance with the provisions of national legislation, and adheres to strict neutrality regarding the choice of workers whether or not to join a trade union organization and/or the choice of the union by which to be represented. In the event of a discrepancy between local and international standards, the Group strives to apply the provisions that best protect workers\u2019 rights. Finally, Enel provides adequate information to its employees and to the trade union organizations that represent them, in order to facilitate collective bargaining, and provides its people with a full range of information, including via the Company intranet, concerning collective labor agreements and trade union agreements, in accordance with current legislation.\n\nAs also illustrated in the Policy on Human Rights, collective bargaining agreements are acknowledged as the main tool to determine the contractual conditions of its employees and to regulate relations between senior management and trade unions. In 2022, the percentage of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements was about 91% (90% in 2021).\n\nAt European level, the Agreement on the Enel European Works Council of 2016, extended in 2022, is confirmed as one of the most advanced agreements in the EU electricity sector for its focus on bilateral issues such as occupational health and safety, training and diversity. Enel and the domestic and European federations (IndustriALL Europe and the European Public Services Union) have transferred their consolidated experience of social dialogue to the Sectoral Social Dialogue Committee of the\nelectricity sector, established at the EU Commission \u2013 DG Employment \u2013 regarding the employment impacts of the energy transition and digitalization in the coming years in all European and global electricity companies. In the various countries in which it maintains a presence, Enel is committed to managing the transition by entering into robust dialogue with the trade unions, translating in practice the principles of the just transition for everyone, including local communities and contractors, the people most directly involved in the process of change (see also the chapter \u201cOur commitment to a just transition: leaving no one behind\u201d).\n\nFirst with the Italian trade unions and then with those of other countries where the Group is present, Enel has also signed an agreement, the Charter of the Person, to protect individuals in their work, personal and social spheres. The document not only outlines new guidelines in industrial relations, but more generally reaffirms the centrality of people, starting with their well-being and motivation, guaranteeing quality training in terms of self-learning and high safety standards, rooted in the responsible approach of all (see the dedicated box at the beginning of this chapter).\n\nIn the event of organizational changes, timely disclosure to trade union representatives is required, as indicated in the table below.\n\n| Country       | Minimum Period                                                                 | Legal Provisions/Collective Agreements                                                                 |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Argentina     | In view of the general provisions of the law and, in analogy, a minimum period of 48 hours will be taken into account for the purpose of notifying any amendment of the essential conditions of the employment contract | There are no legal requirements or provisions in collective agreements                                   |\n| Brazil        | It is convention and practice to provide \u201ctimely\u201d information                  | There are no legal requirements or provisions in collective agreements                                   |\n| Chile         | Neither the law nor collective bargaining provide for a minimum notice period in the event of organizational changes |                                                                                                        |\n| Colombia      | Neither the law nor collective bargaining provide for a minimum notice period in the event of organizational changes |                                                                                                        |\n| Italy         | 25 days.

It also means suppliers are essential partners to achieve sustainable progress across our operating footprint.\n\nSuppliers are our partners in the journey to sustainable growth. We work with them to maximize the economic, productive, social and environmental benefits of the transition. We strive to create sustainable, innovative, and circular processes that also enable us to better quantify, and thus mitigate, the total impacts they generate, aware of the need to minimize pressure on critical materials and components through technological innovation and continuous recycling and to support our partners\u2019 resilience and repurposing.\n\nAll of this underpinned by loyalty, transparency and collaboration. We ask in addition to guaranteeing the necessary quality standard. The latter include working conditions, health and safety, adequate hours worked, rejection of forced or child labor, respect for personal dignity, nondiscrimination and inclusion of diversity, freedom of association and collective bargaining, and respect for privacy by design and by default.\n\nAll of the above, within a clear code of conduct framework that includes, to name a few, our Human Rights Policy, Code of Ethics, Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan and our global compliance programs.\n\nPurchases and tenders for goods and services Supplies, works and services contracts (mil euros)\n\n| Supplies | Works | Services |\n|----------|-------|----------|\n| 5,480    | 3,625 | 4,965    |\n| 6,509    | 3,776 | 6,744    |\n| 7,820    | 4,492 | 9,788    |\n\n99% SUPPLIERS QUALIFIED ON HEALTH AND SAFETY ASPECTS, ENVIRONMENTAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS\n99% in 2021\n\n96% RATIO OF TENDERS INCLUDING SUSTAINABILITY \u201cKS\u201d\n83% in 2021 +13%\n\n9,427 TOTAL QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS WITH A CONTRACT STILL ACTIVE AT THE END OF 2022\n6,717 in 2021 +40.3%\n\nSustainable supply chain\nIn 2022, the total for works, services and supply amounts to over 22 billion euros, of which more than a third is in Italy, followed by Romania and Spain.\n\nTogether with our suppliers, we work to define new metrics and promote co-innovation projects in the perspective of a decarbonization and circular economy pathway, with positive impacts on both power generation processes and purchasing methods (for example, the collaboration with the startup Alesea, see the chapter \u201cInnovation\u201d). Specifically:\n\n- promote a circular procurement approach through the adoption of many initiatives and mechanisms, including the obligation for suppliers belonging to core categories\\(^1\\) to provide and to issue an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD), aiming at quantifying, certifying and communicating the environmental impacts generated along the entire life cycle suppliers\u2019 processes. Certified data allow us to measure emissions along the entire supply chain, promoting in this way the Group\u2019s decarbonization pathway;\n\n- as part of our tendering process, we set increasingly challenging CO\\(_2\\) reduction targets on core supply categories,\\(^1\\) which also take into account the contributions of innovation. These targets are shared with our suppliers and are in line with a 1.5 \u00b0C path;\n\n- for strategic product groups, suppliers are required to provide information on the amount of each raw material. This information allows us to reward suppliers based on their capability to make use of recycled materials as inputs in their production processes, thus stimulating a circular culture and reducing pressure on transition-critical materials;\n\n- we work together with suppliers to define criteria, technical requirements and solutions to further strengthen circularity and sustainability in the early stages of the value chain. The purpose of this approach is to maximize the overall value of the product: on the one hand, by making use of recycled material along the supply chain and, on the other, by reducing the \u201cGlobal Warming Potential\u201d and thus CO\\(_2\\) emissions.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Core categories are those that are strategic for the business including wind turbines, smart meters, photovoltaics, transformers, street lighting, smart home solutions and storage systems.\nSupplier management and assessment processes\n\nIn addition to ensuring the necessary quality standards, supplier performance must go hand in hand with a commitment to adopt best practices according to the highest sustainability standards. Therefore, partner selection and contract execution are subject to analysis and monitoring activities throughout the entire procurement process:\n\n**Supplier qualification system**\n\nEach potential supplier, taking into account their business, can undertake a qualification pathway for one or more product groups (PG) and select the countries in which to supply goods and services. Suppliers are only acknowledged as suitable if they meet all the specific requirements for each PG selected.\n\nAll product groups are analyzed at a global level and with the support of the different areas involved in the field, to set the requirements in question. In particular, the analysis involves:\n\n- mapping of the activities included in each PG;\n- choice of the qualification pathway depending on supplier type (there are ad hoc processes for start-ups, sector leaders and industrial groups);\n- allocation of a risk level for each key issue (health and safety, environment, reputation, etc.);\n- categorization into PGs based on the risk detected.\n\nWith specific reference to sustainability aspects, the questionnaires require information on:\n\n- **health and safety**, via the \u201cSafety Self-Assessment\u201d and its straightforward indication to our suppliers of the fundamental requirements on which to work and grow together;\n- **environment**: with a scale of 1 to 3 (1=worst; 3=best, respectively), environmental criteria are evaluated, which are different depending on the relevant PG and its associated level of risk.\n\nWith regard to health, safety and environmental aspects, for the highest risk PGs, an on-site audit at supplier\u2019s premises/sites is always required.\n\nBefore proceeding with qualification, two further assessments are carried out, regardless the related product group level of risk. Specifically:\n\n- a **reputational assessment** of the potential supplier through national and international data providers. In addition to compliance with the relevant laws and regulations, suppliers are required to adhere to the principles to which we have committed ourselves with our Policy on Human Rights, Code of Ethics, Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan and global compliance programs, with specific reference to the absence of conflict of interest (including potential) and, depending on the specific risk classes, the submission of specific certifications/self-declarations;\n- a **human rights assessment**, particularly with regard to labor practices (such as rejection of forced or child labor, respect for diversity and non-discrimination, freedom of\nassociation and collective bargaining, fair and favorable working conditions, including hours worked and adequate wages, protection of workers\u2019 privacy, and supply chain verification) and relations with communities (local, indigenous and tribal peoples) and society, through the administration of a dedicated questionnaire.\n\nIf the outcome of these analyses and assessments is positive, individual suppliers can qualify and be added to the Supplier Register (or remain on it if previously qualified) and then be invited to participate in the Group\u2019s procurement procedures. If the outcome is negative, the supplier will not be able to participate in the Group\u2019s tenders but may submit a new request for qualification at a later date.\n\nCompliance with the requirements must be assured for the entire duration of the qualification and, as such, those already included in the Enel Register of Qualified Suppliers are constantly monitored, partly by reference to external databases, for events that may affect their company and its main representatives.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, 99% of all qualified suppliers were assessed according to social, environmental and safety criteria. The total number of qualified suppliers with a contract still active at the end of 2022 was about 9,400 (about 46% of active suppliers as of December 31), while the total number of active qualified companies was about 31,400.\n\nThe following table shows the trend in the qualified suppliers\u2019 percentage for the three aspects analyzed by process.\n\n% of qualified suppliers according to social, environmental and safety aspects at December 31\n\n|                | Human rights | Safety | Environment |\n|----------------|--------------|--------|-------------|\n| 2020           | 93           | 93     | 93          |\n| 2021           | 99           | 99     | 99          |\n| 2022           | 99           | 99     | 99          |\nTender and contracting processes\n\nConsistent with our commitment to introduce sustainability aspects into the tendering processes, we adopted a structured process governed by a specific procedure to define \u201csustainability Ks\u201d, which can be used in the tendering stage by the various purchasing and monitoring units throughout the entire life of the contract. The process includes two \u201cLibraries\u201d, in which all \u201csustainability requirements and Ks\u201d are catalogued, grouped into the macro-categories of certification, environmental and circularity aspects, such as waste management and carbon footprint assessments according to UNI EN ISO 14067:2018, and social aspects, such as training and employment of people from local communities and actions to respect gender diversity. These are periodically updated within a cross-functional working group dedicated to sustainability and circularity issues, taking into account market maturity and new corporate strategies.\n\nWe include specific clauses in all contracts for works, services and supplies, which are updated periodically to take account of the various regulatory changes and align ourselves with international best practices. The general terms and conditions refer to the current regulations on remuneration, contributions, insurance and tax, with reference to all workers employed for any reason in the execution of the contract by the supplier. In addition, the principles set forth in the ILO Conventions and legal obligations regarding child and women\u2019s labor, equal treatment, prohibition of discrimination, abuse and harassment, freedom of trade unions, association and representation, rejection of forced labor, safety and environmental protection, and sanitary conditions are explicitly recalled. In the event of conflict between the latter and the ILO Conventions, the more restrictive standards will prevail. The clauses also require suppliers to undertake to prevent all forms of corruption (Art. 29.1.3 and Art. 29.1.4 of the General Terms and Conditions).\n\nIn addition to the legal provisions, the contractual conditions require that our suppliers:\n\n- recognize the \u201cten principles\u201d of the United Nations Global Compact and declare that they manage their business activities and operations in order to meet these fundamental responsibilities in the fields of human rights, labor, the environment and the fight against corruption (Art. 28 of the General Terms and Conditions);\n- acknowledge the commitments we have made in the documents below and refer to them in the execution of the contract: The Policy on Human Rights, which also includes a principle relating to respect for biodiversity; the Code of Ethics; Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan; and the global models for the prevention of criminal risks (Art. 29.1.1 of the General Terms and Conditions);\n- adopt suitable conduct to avoid the emergence of conflicts of interest throughout the entire term of the contract and undertake to notify us promptly in writing if any such circumstances arise (Art. 29.2 of the General Terms and Conditions).\n\nWe reserve the right to carry out any control and monitoring activity to check compliance with the obligations set out above by both the supplier and any of its subcontractors, and to terminate the contract immediately if any breach is ascertained.\n\nMonitoring systems\n\nThe goal is to take any corrective actions if the suppliers on the Register do not fulfill any requirement anymore during the execution of the contract.\n\nIn particular, the following monitoring strands are provided for all suppliers on the Register, regardless of whether they have an active contract or not:\n\n- **reputational monitoring**: based on the monitoring of open sources and carried out continuously (24/7). The objective is to identify potential reputational risks arising from a counterparty\u2019s involvement in criminal proceedings, with a particular focus on environmental crimes and human rights violations in business practice. This monitoring also collects reports made through the whistleblowing channel, which is made available to all stakeholders and can be accessed locally in different languages;\n- **document monitoring**: this action aims to verify legal documents (e.g. criminal records) and their validity. The documents monitored take into account the legal specificities of each individual country in which we are present;\n- **Contractor Safety Assessment**: additional verification carried out both during the qualification phase and during the execution of the contract for PGs with a medium/high level of health, safety and environmental risk. The objective is to identify HSE improvement areas that are conducive to obtaining and retaining the qualification. A total of 1,120 assessments were conducted during 2022.\n\nFor suppliers on the Register who have an active contract, the following monitoring strands are provided in addition to the systems already described:\n\n- health, safety and environmental monitoring of field performance (during contract performance): the performance of our suppliers is assessed and monitored through field inspections that identify existing non-conformities and potential hazards with respect to contractual commitments, technical standards and authoriza-\ntion and legislative requirements. The primary objective of the inspections is to prevent accidents, injuries, illnesses and events that may affect the environment. During field inspections, specific checklists are used to facilitate the homogeneous aggregation of non-conformity data for subsequent corrective action. This data is not only analyzed by the contract manager to take corrective action, but also feeds into the Supplier Performance Management (SPM) process to allow analysis and prevention and correction initiatives on a larger scale (see the section \u201cSupplier Performance Management\u201d);\n\n- Supplier Performance Management (SPM): monitoring based on objective and systematic collection of data and information related to the performance of the technical service under the contract (see the section \u201cSupplier Performance Management\u201d).\n\nThe evaluation of the data coming from the different monitoring strands is the responsibility of specific committees, composed of representatives from both the procurement area and the Business Lines. Specifically:\n\n- the Qualification Commission, present in all major countries, is in charge of accepting/rejecting qualification requests, assessing possible suspensions and examining proposals for changes to the technical qualification requirements and to the PG tree put forward by the Business Lines. In 2022, the total number of times these committees met was 346;\n\n- the Integrity Committee, composed of representatives from Global Procurement, the Legal Function, the Security Function, and the Technical Functions of the Business Lines, meets whenever a critical issue emerges that may have negative repercussions on the honorability of the supplier under consideration, to analyze it and to assess the application of specific actions or penalties with regard to supplier companies. During 2022, this committee met 39 times;\n\n- the Evaluation Group is convened by the Health Safety Environment and Quality Function of the Holding Company and is responsible for analyzing the data coming from HSE monitoring and for evaluating possible consequence management measures. In addition to representatives of the competent HSEQ Functions of the Business Lines, representatives of the Global Procurement, the Legal Function, and the Technical Functions of the Business Lines are also on this committee. During 2022, this committee met 40 times.\n\n### Supplier Performance Management\n\nAmong the monitoring systems that are carried out during contract execution is the Supplier Performance Management (SPM). The goal, with a view to collaboration with our suppliers, is not only to take any corrective actions during the execution of the contract, but also to encourage a pathway of improvement made possible by actions that reward best practices.\n\nThe process is based on the objective and systematic disclosure of data and information on the execution of the contracted work. This data is used to develop specific indicators, also called categories (Quality, Punctuality, Health and Safety, Environment, Human Rights & Fairness, Innovation & Collaboration), which are combined to form a weighted average and produce the **Supplier Performance Index (SPI)**. The categories and SPI can be used as assessment elements for participation in tenders and for maintenance of the contractual relationship.\n\nMonitoring activities related to the Supplier Performance Management are conducted by the various Business Lines with the support of the relevant health, safety and environment units, where applicable, and the Supplier Qualification and Performance Management unit. In addition, all Enel people who interact with suppliers have the opportunity to express their own assessment using the dedicated Track & Rate app.\n\nIn the event of poor performance, we take specific actions that can be reflected in:\n\n- qualification (e.g. updating the duration of qualification, increasing or decreasing the overall economic potential, meaning bands of tender amounts within which suppliers can enter, suspension of qualification, etc.);\n\n- the contract (for example, further investigations, improvement action plan, termination, reduction or increase in volumes, etc.). In the event that issues are found with the conduct of a supplier, an action plan may be drawn up jointly, the execution of which is subjected to our constant monitoring.\nThe SPM process monitored 701 PGs and 7,666 suppliers last year (compared to 698 PGs and around 6,782 suppliers in 2021).\n\nTraining and information\n\nOver the past few years, we have organized several thematic events concerning decarbonization, adopting circular business models, respecting human rights and supply chain mapping (collection of information aimed at creating a global map of the supply network), with the aim of sharing best practices and multistakeholder approaches in line with the international reference standards for a sustainable conduct. Still on the subject of protection and awareness-raising, many initiatives were undertaken to involve suppliers in health and safety aspects.\n\nIn addition, articles are published periodically on the Enel Global Procurement website that highlight the commitment made by the Group to these topics (https://globalprocurement.enel.com).\n\nSuppliers\n\n- **9,922** Tier 1 suppliers\n- **60%** of Tier 1 suppliers are deemed relevant (\u201ccritical suppliers\u201d) in relation to their strategic importance related to the Company\u2019s business unique purchase volumes, and other factors that could have economic, social and environmental impacts\n- **5,950** Tier 1 suppliers assessed during 2022 (includes assessments made during qualification, tendering and contract award phases)\n- **27%** assessed Tier 1 suppliers that have been assigned improvement actions\n- **100%** of assessed suppliers presented improvement action plans and improved their ESG performance as a consequence\nCreation of sustainable value: Supplier Development Program\n\nWe have launched several initiatives to increase the resilience of the supply chain and to make Supplier Centricity more and more concrete and tangible. One example is the Supplier Development Program, initially launched in Italy (where it is currently open to more than 6,000 suppliers) and being extended to other countries of presence, to support the growth path of companies in the supply chain and, at the same time, contribute to the achievement of the Group\u2019s strategic objectives. The Program is aimed at companies, based or with branches in Italy, that are qualified or at an advanced stage of qualification in our Supplier Register and have a production value up to 250 million euros. We pay particular attention to small and medium enterprises operating in strategic sectors that will benefit from our direct support to provide access to certain services.\n\nBy entering into agreements with the main players, we guarantee more favorable conditions than the market average and we contribute with partial coverage of the services offered as part of the program. These range from financial instruments that can facilitate access to liquidity, to managerial and technical training programs that promote the conversion of the business towards the energy transition, from consulting services on sustainability, circular economy, strategy, M&A and internationalization, to access to catalogs of means of transport and working machines, all the way to services to obtain certifications. Particular attention is paid to initiatives to support the conversion and diversification of businesses, such as the \u201cCompanies Counter\u201d, consisting of periodic meetings with individual traditional generation companies to support them in their processes of growth and redevelopment towards expansion in areas such as renewables or new services related to energy efficiency.\n\nThe development that Enel intends to promote takes the form of:\n\n- increased awareness about sustainability and digitalization matters;\n- differentiation of the business and consequent reduction in supplier dependence on Enel;\n- increased financial strength;\n- internationalization, which helps grow our business outside of Italy and Europe.\n\nAt the end of 2021, the program \u201cEnergie per Crescere\u201d (Energies to Grow) was launched, with the aim of training about 8,200 new technicians, including 5,500 by 2023, belonging to grids suppliers, creating highly requested professional profiles in the sector (for example, cable pullers, cable splicers, substation assemblers, live-line workers); the remaining 2,700 technicians will be trained and hired by 2025 and the training will be devoted to Enel Green Power suppliers so as to integrate professional profiles in the renewable sector (for example, electrical specialist, junior site manager, civil-mechanical specialist). Energie per Crescere sees the collaboration of several actors: ELIS, a non-profit organization that provides vocational training, the major employment agencies in Italy, Accredia-certified training institutes at which the candidates, once selected, attend the planned 200 hour courses and, finally, Enel\u2019s contracting companies that hire the participants throughout the country at the end of the training course.\n\nDuring 2022, some 2,100 new technicians were trained and recruited from grids suppliers. A new phase of program development is planned for 2023, with the involvement of the Enel X contractor network aimed at strengthening profiles in energy efficiency and photovoltaics.\nENERGIE PER LA SCUOLA: a bridge between companies and training for the energy transition\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, the Energie per la Scuola program was launched programme for final year students attending technical and vocational schools, with the aim of training them for the \u2018most wanted\u2019 roles in the electricity sector so that, after graduation, they can be hired by Enel\u2019s suppliers. The training course covers the profiles most in demand in the electrical sector. The aim is to create a bridge between education and the professional sphere, encouraging the students to acquire the skills needed to embrace the new professions of the energy transition, and facilitating their access into the workplace with the Group\u2019s suppliers immediately after graduation, also through greater knowledge of the industrial realities in the industry.\n\nThe initiative entails the signing of agreements between companies and schools, based on the PCTO (Percorsi per le Competenze Trasversali e l\u2019Orientamento \u2013 Pathways for Transversal Skills and Orientation) model defined in the Guidelines drawn up by the Ministry of Education, University and Research.\n\nThe training includes a basic course lasting 120 hours and a further specialized course lasting 40 hours and geared towards the profiles \u2018most wanted\u2019 in the e-distribuzione sector. Training is provided by certified training institutions in partnership with schools.\n\nThe first edition of the program (school year 2020/2021) involved 11 schools, 8 suppliers of e-distribution and a total of some 100 students who were all hired by Enel\u2019s suppliers at the end of the training. The second edition, aimed at 2022/2023 school year students, is currently underway and it involves over 60 schools and some 500 students.\n\nTheory and practice will go hand in hand with an innovative and engaging teaching approach that will allow the students to consolidate the knowledge acquired in the classroom with experience in the field, through a series of highly specialized courses, a real springboard towards new professional opportunities.\nFuel procurement\n\nSuppliers of solid and liquid fuel are selected through the \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d process that, for each counterpart, evaluates the reputational and economic-financial aspects and their satisfaction of the appropriate technical and commercial requirements. Checks also ensure that suppliers are not on specific United Nations, European Union and OFAC \u201cBlack Lists\u201d.\n\nThese lists identify individuals or organizations associated with terrorist associations, organizations under EU financial sanctions, and so-called Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs) who are subject to US sanctions on terrorism or drug trafficking charges, among others.\n\nTo assess the sustainability aspects of coal sources, an internal process has been established to ensure that Group requirements for occupational safety, environment and human rights have been satisfied.\n\nPurchase contracts entered into with each supplier are subject to the Group principles embedded in the Human Rights Policy, the Code of Ethics and the Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan, with which suppliers must be aligned with. We reserve the right to terminate contracts in case of severe breach of those principles.\n\nLastly, to mitigate the risks arising from the maritime shipment of fuel, we have adopted a tool to vet and select the carriers used. Vetting is a recognized industry standard for oil transportation. Enel, together with an increasing number of operators, is also applying this methodology for dry bulk transports.\n\n| Resources used in the production process | UM | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2022-2021 | % Perimeter |\n|-----------------------------------------|----|------|------|------|-----------|------------|\n| Fuel consumption for thermoelectric production from non-renewable sources | | | | | | |\n| Coal (000 t) | 8,522 | 5,958 | 5,893 | 2,564 | 43.0 | Enel |\n| Lignite (000 t) | \u2013 | \u2013 | 105 | \u2013 | \u2013 | Enel |\n| Fuel oil (000 t) | 889 | 863 | 975 | 26 | 3.0 | Enel |\n| Natural gas (Mm\u00b3) | 13,214 | 15,682 | 13,075 | -2,468 | -15.7 | Enel |\n| Gas oil (000 t) | 1,262 | 1,033 | 906 | 229 | 22.2 | Enel |\n| from renewable resources | | | | | | |\n| Biomass and waste for thermoelectric production (000 t) | 65 | 71 | 89 | -6 | -8.5 | Enel |\n| Biogas (Mm\u00b3) | 1.2 | 0.7 | 0.1 | 0.5 | 71.4 | Enel |\n| Geothermal steam used for electricity production (000 t) | 49,947 | 350,160 | 350,090 | -300,213 | -85.7 | Enel |\nTogether with major European electric utilities, we are actively engaged in Bettercoal \u2013 a global initiative to promote the continuous improvement of corporate responsibility in the international coal industry. Bettercoal has released a code of conduct based on existing and agreed standards of social responsibility in the mining sector. The Code provides detailed guidelines to mining companies in the definition of their social, environment and ethical policies. The Bettercoal Code establishes members\u2019 expectations regarding suppliers\u2019 practices related to four main categories: management systems; commitment to ethics and transparency; human and labor rights; and environmental performance, while promoting ongoing improvement. In 2021, a new version of the Code was finalized to align it with the latest best practices in sustainability, thereby contributing to achievement of the applicable Sustainable Development Goals. In addition, the new version of the Bettercoal Code ensures the integration of the mine closure and rehabilitation processes, embedding environmental, social, economic and governance aspects into operations from the earliest stages of mine development.\n\nMining companies adhering, signing a letter of commitment, start a virtuous path by accepting on-site checks, carried out by independent third parties, to verify that the Code\u2019s principles have been applied, and agreeing an ongoing improvement plan to overcome any shortfalls. In addition to Bettercoal\u2019s growing presence in several forums in the area of coal and supply chain sustainability, the initiative has become an example of collaboration together with different stakeholders, aimed at improving socially responsible practices within the supply chain. During 2022, as members of Bettercoal within the working group dedicated to Colombia, we participated in the delegation that travelled to Colombia, for the first time since 2018, with the aim of further improving our understanding of the critical issues surrounding coal mining in the country, allowing us to foster better stakeholder relations with all involved in this complex environment, including companies, the government, international NGOs and local communities. During the visit, several meetings were organized with over 60 stakeholders, including business associations, communities and local governments.\n\nIn addition, a new working group specifically dedicated to South Africa was established in 2022 due to changing international scenarios. For further information, please refer to the website www.bettercoal.org.\nBelow the 2022 results related to the targets of the previous 2022-2024 Sustainability Plan, the resulting progress and the targets of the 2023-2025 Sustainability Plan, which may be redefined, added to, or surpassed with respect to the previous Plan.\n\n| SDG | Activities | 2022 results | Progress | 2023-2025 targets | Tag |\n|-----|------------|--------------|----------|-------------------|-----|\n| 4   | Inclusive and equitable quality education | 3.7 mil beneficiaries (2015-2022) | \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf | 5.0 mil beneficiaries in 2030(1) | S G |\n| 7   | Affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy | 15.6 mil beneficiaries (2015-2022) | \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf | 20.0 mil beneficiaries in 2030(1) | S G |\n| 8   | Sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth | 4.9 mil beneficiaries (2015-2022) | \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf | 8.0 mil beneficiaries in 2030(1) | S G |\n| 17  | Strengthening and promoting operational partnerships | 1,215 partnerships launched | \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf | Strengthening and promoting operational partnerships | S G |\n| 1   | Development of new projects to benefit the communities where Enel operates for the creation of shared value (CSV) | 2,325 projects | \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf | | S G |\n| 2   | | | | | |\n| 3   | | | | | |\n| 5   | | | | | |\n| 10  | | | | | |\n| 17  | Dissemination of the CSV model in operating assets | 1,527 total CSV applications(2) | \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf | | S I |\n\n(1) Cumulative figures since 2015.\n(2) For more details on CSV applications, please refer to the note in the chapter \u201cEngaging communities\u201d.\n\nGoals\n- New\n- Redefined\n- Outdated\n\nProgress\n- Not in line\n- In line\n- Achieved\n\nN.A. = not applicable\nEstablishing solid and lasting community relations in the local areas where we operate is a fundamental pillar of our strategy, based on a model of business development and management in continuous interaction with the communities themselves in order to create long-term and constant shared value, in full respect of human rights and without leaving anyone behind.\n\nAs part of the transition process towards a decarbonized economy as a driver of growth and modernization for communities, we promote economic development, welfare, quality of life and equality.\n\nThis approach has led us to innovate the way we run our business (introducing, for example, sustainable site and facility management models; see section \u201cRenewable energies\u201d in the chapter \u201cClean electrification\u201d) as well as the processes of developing energy products and services in an inclusive direction. An approach that also counts on the activation of virtuous ecosystems, such as the Open Innovability\u00ae platform, based on openness and sharing, as an indispensable element to facilitate and promote the identification of innovative social ideas and solutions (for further information see the chapter \u201cInnovation\u201d).\nManaging community relations and other stakeholders is an enabling factor for all sustainability activities, which rely on specific operational levers:\n\n- **Sustainability by design**: in order to integrate a long-term sustainability approach into the business, it is necessary, as far as possible, to anticipate and address all sustainability issues at the design stage of Company activities;\n- **Ad hoc interventions**: activities that occur after the start of the business project, in response to events or needs that arise during the construction of the assets, the performance of daily activities, the operation of plants or the interaction with stakeholders;\n- **Crisis management**: sustainability interventions may need to be implemented in relation to sudden and unforeseen occurrences and serious damage such as critical events relating to Group assets, projects or products and resulting from natural disasters or social/community unrest. These situations will be handled with dedicated and targeted initiatives.\n\nIn 2022 our contribution to the social and economic development and growth of the territories resulted in more than 2,300 sustainability projects in the various countries where we are present, involving more than 6.3 million beneficiaries, in line with the sustainable development goals (SDGs).\n\nThese projects range from infrastructure development to education and vocational training programs, projects to support cultural and economic activities, promotion of access to energy, rural and suburban electrification, and promotion of social inclusion for the most vulnerable groups of the population (physically, socially and economically). Among the initiatives to support socio-economic development are:\n\n- the promotion of inclusive business models, such as the development of e-commerce platforms to foster access to credit and the development of the local economy, to support the less privileged segments of the population;\n- combating energy poverty through energy awareness initiatives;\n- digitalization to support connectivity in rural areas and computer literacy;\n- projects aimed at fostering the participation of women in STEM subjects, for the development of local economies.\n\nIn realizing our commitment to communities, we are not alone: we have more than 1,200 active partnerships internationally with non-profit organizations, social enterprises, start-ups and institutions rooted in the local areas with valuable local expertise, because we believe in the value of a multi-stakeholder approach.\n\n---\n\n1. An application is interpreted as the use of at least one CSV instrument in relation to an asset, in any phase of the chain of value and in any Business Line. The CSV applications in the BD phase include applications regarding BD opportunities (also at the beginning phases) and business projects output from the pipeline. The CSV applications in the E&C phase can refer to assets passed to the O&M phase at the end of the year. The number of CSV applications in Infrastructure & Networks (I&N) may refer to the concession area, but also areas identified by municipalities and substations. The value includes companies consolidated using the equity method and companies for which the Build, Sell and Operate (BSO) mechanism has been applied.\n\n2. Beneficiaries are the people in whose favor the project was carried out. Enel considers only the beneficiaries for the current year. The number of beneficiaries considers the activities and projects carried out in all the areas in which the Group operates. Solely within the NFS perimeter (excluding companies consolidated using the equity method, foundations, Group non-profit organizations and companies to which the Build, Sell and Operate, or BSO mechanism has been applied), the number of beneficiaries in 2022 is 0.6 million for SDG 4, 2.3 million for SDG 7 and 1.2 million for SDG 8.\nOur model for creating shared value with communities\n\nEstablishing strong and lasting community relations, including local communities and indigenous and tribal peoples, requires a broad, inclusive and continuous dialogue based on well-defined stages of stakeholder engagement, in line with relevant international standards (such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises), aiming therefore to:\n\n1. incorporate responsible Company conduct into policies and management systems;\n2. prevent or mitigate impacts;\n3. monitor the implementation of improvement plans and results;\n4. communicate how impacts are managed.\n\nIndeed, when conducted as early as possible in the planning phase, stakeholder engagement enables us to identify the requirements of the populations within our sphere of influence and generate the most comprehensive possible mapping of the potential consequences our activity may have on them. The process aims to:\n\n- identify stakeholders within the sphere of influence of our business;\n- verify that the stakeholders identified ensure representation of all groups affected by the development of our activities in our sphere of influence;\n- analyze the type of relationship that can be created between us and the mapped stakeholders in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest;\n- provide common guidelines for those responsible for managing stakeholder consultation processes to achieve and implement a robust engagement procedure, seeking to prevent any potential situation that might undermine stakeholder expectations;\n- develop an understanding of our sphere of influence by conducting context analyses containing a wide range of socio-economic and environmental data;\n- guarantee that consultation satisfies specific conditions of quality, such as being free, preventive, inclusive, adapted to the local context, bidirectional and well documented, in line with international reference standards;\n- share all the information about the project that is relevant for the concerned stakeholders in order to promote transparent and collaborative relationships.\n\n- involve independent third parties in negotiation processes because of their expertise in the area and as a \u201cbona fide witness\u201d, if applicable;\n- facilitate and support engaging local communities in project monitoring through local training, sharing transparent information on project phases and the methodology for defining target areas;\n- provide an access channel, characterized according to the context, for any reports from people who need to contact us, based on tools and means available at the site, such as local teams or specific people, toll-free numbers, the internet; or, in the case of isolated rural communities, even local leaders willing to collect all possible complaints periodically.\n\nThe functioning of the model is governed by organizational documents that define roles and responsibilities in the various stages of its implementation. Examples are the Policy \u201cCSV Process definition and management\u201d and the Operational Instruction \u201cProject Portfolio Management System\u201d, including the management of the digitalized platform dedicated to project reporting.\n\nThe definition and dissemination of guidelines for implementing the sustainability model, the assessment of the sustainability projects, the management of the projects on a Group level and the dissemination of best practices in the countries we operate in are guaranteed by the Holding\u2019s Innovability\u00ae organizational structure and by the relative sustainability structures in the various countries of operation and Business Lines. Each country and each Business Line adapts the procedures for the global policy and the procedures for application of the model on a local level, based on the specific aspects of business and the context.\n\nIn response to the growing challenges posed by the new social and economic context and the increasingly central role assumed by sustainability in every phase of business, we are reviewing our models to ensure their scalability and increase their impact. We are also accelerating the adoption of an approach focused on assessing the impacts of our sustainability projects by setting increasingly specific targets.\nThe value created for the communities\n\nThe contribution to sustainable development goals\n\nThe sustainability of our strategy is also confirmed by the progress achieved in terms of the Group\u2019s contribution to achieving the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDG), with particular reference to projects targeted at:\n\n- ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy (SDG 7) which has affected 15.6 million people to date;\\(^{(4)}\\)\n- promoting sustained, lasting, inclusive and sustainable economic growth (SDG 8) with 4.9 million beneficiaries.\\(^{(5)}\\)\n\n| Activities | Target 2015-2030 | Results 2015-2022 | Status | SDG |\n|------------|------------------|-------------------|--------|-----|\n| Quality education | 5 million beneficiaries\\(^{(3)}\\) | 3.7 mil | IN LINE | SDG 4 |\n| | | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n| | | 0.1 mil | 0.2 mil | 0.3 mil | 0.4 mil | 0.3 mil | 1.0 mil | 0.7 mil | 0.7 mil |\n| Affordable and clean energy | 20 million beneficiaries\\(^{(3)}\\) | 15.6 mil | IN LINE | SDG 7 |\n| | | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n| | | 1.5 mil | 1.3 mil | 1.3 mil | 2.2 mil | 1.6 mil | 1.9 mil | 3.5 mil | 2.3 mil |\n| Decent work and economic growth | 8 million beneficiaries\\(^{(3)}\\) | 4.9 mil | IN LINE | SDG 8 |\n| | | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n| | | 0.4 mil | 0.7 mil | 0.4 mil | 0.3 mil | 0.3 mil | 0.9 mil | 0.7 mil | 1.2 mil |\n\n(1) Beneficiaries are the people in whose favor the project was carried out. Enel considers only the direct beneficiaries for the current year. The number of beneficiaries considers the activities and projects carried out in all the areas in which the Group operates.\n\n(3) Cumulative data from 2015-2022 on the total number of beneficiaries of SDG 4 to date.\n(4) Cumulative data from 2015-2022 on the total number of beneficiaries of SDG 7 to date.\n(5) Cumulative data from 2015-2022 on the total number of beneficiaries of SDG 8 to date.\nMeasure the value of our commitment for communities\n\nWe make a substantive contribution to the development and social and economic growth of the territories and communities where we operate with varying types of intervention, ranging from the expansion of infrastructure to education and training programs, from initiatives targeting social inclusion initiatives to projects supporting local cultural life.\n\nTo measure our action, we adopted the LBG (London Benchmarking Group) method, which makes it possible to clearly determine and classify the Company\u2019s contribution toward the development of the communities where it is present and compare it with other companies.\n\nIn particular, according to the LBG standard, the expense for the contributions to the communities can be divided as follows:\n\n- **donations**: pro bono contributions and without obligations for the beneficiaries, except that they have to use the donation for charitable purposes and for non-profit associations. For Enel, this item includes all the monetary and \u201cin kind\u201d charitable donations, including those for philanthropic and solidarity activities;\n- **investments in the community**: medium/long-term involvement in community support projects, also in partnership with local organizations, aimed at addressing significant problems both for the territory as well as for the Company. This category includes, for example, projects related to a wider strategy to the benefit of the community, such as \u201cAccess to electricity\u201d, or specific initiatives dedicated to the communities near the power plants (please refer to the chapters \u201cClean electrification\u201d and \u201cManaging human rights\u201d);\n- **commercial initiatives with a social impact**: contributes to activities connected to the core business, in which the Company promotes its own brand and its own corporate identity. Examples of these initiatives are the marketing campaigns that also provide benefits for the community, or that include contributions for charitable purposes.\n\nIn 2022, Enel\u2019s total contribution to the communities in which it operates was **about 120 million euro** (6) (+31.6% compared to 2021), registering in particular an increase in investments in communities compared to last year.\n\n### 2022 initiatives in favor of communities by purpose (%)\n\n| Purpose                                      | Percentage |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Donations                                    | 12.1%      |\n| Community investments                        | 64.4%      |\n| Commercial initiatives with a social impact  | 23.5%      |\n\n### 2022 initiatives in favor of communities by type (%)\n\n| Type                                      | Percentage |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Cash contribution                         | 86.2%      |\n| Employee volunteerism                     | 0.6%       |\n| Donations in kind (goods/services/projects)| 6.2%       |\n| Management overheads                     | 70%        |\n\n---\n\n(6) The largest increase over last year was in community investments (up by more than \u20ac21 million), particularly in Brazil, Chile and Colombia. Expenditure on donations increased slightly compared to 2021 (increase of about \u20ac5 million), particularly in Brazil and Chile, as did commercial initiatives (increase of \u20ac3 million), particularly in Italy and Iberia due to the prolonged effect of the post-pandemic recovery.\nSustainability projects and initiatives\n\nIn the communities in which we operate, we implement projects that, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals, contribute to the development and social and economic growth of local communities by promoting infrastructure development, education and vocational training, cultural and economic activities, energy access, rural and suburban electrification, the fight against energy poverty, and social inclusion for the most vulnerable population groups.\n\nACCESS TO ELECTRICITY\n\nEnergy to grow \u2013 PERU\n\nThe main objective of the project, activated in 2021, is to accelerate the electrification of new human settlements located in the most disadvantaged areas within our concession area in Peru.\n\nIt is a collaborative project in which we try to work together with municipalities, the population and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). With this project we help families in the communities to improve their living conditions, in terms of health and education, and we also give them the opportunity to open new businesses, thus contributing to their economic development.\n\nWe have managed to reach 20,000 electrified lots by 2022, which will improve the quality of life for 80,000 people.\n\nEnergy security in critical areas \u2013 CHILE\n\nThe project, born in 2018 from an agreement signed between Enel Distribuci\u00f3n Chile and Fundaci\u00f3n Techo Chile, aims to promote sustainable and secure access to energy for families in the municipality of Lampa, in fields located in the concession area.\n\nDuring 2022, 1,900 new suburban connections were built in the municipalities of Lampa, Pudahuel, Colina and Maip\u00fa.\n\nIn alliance with Fundaci\u00f3n Techo and Litro de Luz, solar lights and a WiFi point were installed in the \u201cEl Esfuerzo 2\u201d field in the municipality of Cerrillos, as well as offering workshops and training on unconventional renewable energies, entrepreneurship workshops and digital literacy, thus creating a space to promote social development in the camp.\n\nFinally, Enel Grids organized educational events related to energy efficiency, electrical risk prevention and climate change, as well as initiatives to improve local employability, such as the development of sustainable lighting in collaboration with the Litro de Luz Foundation.\nLeadership network in Florencio Varela \u2013 ARGENTINA\n\nDuring 2022, we set up a community leadership network in the San Jorge \u2013 Villa Argentina neighborhood in the municipality of Florencio Varela in Buenos Aires, in order to strengthen the relationship with neighborhood leaders and formal and informal organizations representing community interests. In this area, the public\u2019s concerns regarding the public electricity service and other issues impacting the community environment are addressed.\n\nThrough this network we accompany the energy service normalization process for 675 new customers, raising awareness, advising and resolving specific claims. During the process, together with neighborhood leaders, we identified specific needs such as:\n\n- computer equipment: 15 PCs were donated to the Centre for Labor Training (CFL);\n- workshops on sustainable energy use: 2 face-to-face workshops of a theoretical-practical nature were held to raise awareness of responsible and efficient consumption;\n- installation of photovoltaic lights with LED technology self-made by residents of the neighborhood;\n- energy transition workshop for students, with theoretical and practical content on technologies associated with the energy transition.\nHortas em Rede (Orti in rete \u2013 BRASILE)\n\nThe Hortas em Rede project, developed by Enel S\u00e3o Paulo, uses the tracks underneath the distributor\u2019s transmission lines to create vegetable gardens in peripheral areas with a high population concentration in the capital\u2019s metropolitan region, demonstrating how a sustainable infrastructure can be integrated into the territory by responding to the needs of communities.\n\nThe project comprises three vegetable gardens in the S\u00e3o Mateus neighborhood and offers the communities in the surrounding area opportunities for employment, vocational training and income generation through the sale of produce grown by the farmers. The most significant innovation of the project is the shift from a value destruction scenario to a shared value creation scenario. Another innovative aspect relates to social inclusion: women and the elderly are in fact the main beneficiaries of the production and marketing of the garden products.\n\nThe project also contributes to the enhancement of the landscape and to creating the conditions for the residents of these areas to become actors and protagonists of a real social transformation. Between 2021 and 2022, 80 farmers and 1,332 people indirectly benefited from Hortas em Rede, generating over about 150,000 euros\\(^{(1)}\\) in income.\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) Value determined using the exchange rate as at December 31.\n\nRuta Pehuenche: a program for the development of small local business people \u2013 CHILE\n\nIn Chile, where the Los C\u00f3ndores hydroelectric plant in the Maule region is under construction, encounters with the local community have generated training and employment opportunities, with the emergence of a women-led micro-entrepreneurial fabric.\n\nThe local development program Ruta Pehuenche was created here, and its name was taken from the international corridor that extends to Argentina and is full of exceptional natural attractions.\n\nThe project was created with the dual goals of promoting the economic growth of the entire community through training courses and improving living conditions through the use of environmentally friendly technologies for water supply, food, housing, energy and the resolution of sanitation issues.\n\nTo date, four years after the project\u2019s inception, more than 80 people (including 70 women) have participated in vocational workshops held in the Chilean localities of La Mina, Paso Nevado, Armerillo and Las Garzas, for a total of 130 hours of training. This initiative has led to the creation of small commercial businesses \u2013 linked to the tourism flow in the area \u2013 that produce items made of wood and jewelry made with stones and ceramic. In addition to improving the ability of families to generate income, the project represents a channel for promoting and strengthening the role of women in the local social fabric.\nThe aim of the project, established in 2017, is to provide financial autonomy to women in Parais\u00f3polis, S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s second largest community. The initiative started as a training course, a way to help women in situations of extreme social vulnerability, often victims of domestic violence. Through the program, women who previously had no income are now finding their economic independence, thanks to the skills acquired through training courses in cutting and sewing, which have taught them a trade from which they can earn their own income.\n\nThe project extends not only to S\u00e3o Paulo, where it originated, but also to the state of Cear\u00e1 and Rio de Janeiro, and has enabled a number of women to receive training from the Enel Shares Entrepreneurship program during its five years of operation. The income generated from the sale of the garments is entirely donated to the women in the production groups to which they belong. In 2021 and 2022, a total of 342 people benefited from the project, generating an income of almost 16,000 euros.\\(^1\\)\n\n\\(^1\\) Value determined using the exchange rate as at December 31.\nEDUCATION\n\nEducating with Energy Enel CEO \u2013 CHILE\n\nThe project, which started in 2022, is based on a training course comprising, on the one hand, theoretical modules at a professional technical institute and at a training platform on electrical risk prevention, and on the other hand, a practical phase at the training sites of the Operational Excellence Centre (CEO). This phase is carried out by the Enel Grids contractors\u2019 operational teams, which ensures that the field work carried out by the students meets the highest quality and safety standards, and is conducted by technical area representatives in cooperation with the contractors, who carry out daily maintenance functions on the networks in the concession area in the metropolitan region. The project was realized through an alliance and public-private partnership between the vocational technical institutes, Chile DUAL, SOFOFA (which contributed as a sponsor) and 10 contracting companies, which in a coordinated manner provided venues for vocational internships for students from the Lampa and Recoleta districts. The objective of this training is to qualify people as much as possible to strengthen the electricity sector, considering customer safety as a priority focus in a participative and inclusive strategy.\n\nLethbridge College Wind Engineering Partnership \u2013 USA\n\nIn Alberta, where we operate four wind farms, we have been pursuing since 2020 a multi-year partnership with Lethbridge College to support the Wind Turbine Technician Training (WTT) program and empower the students of the Piikani Nation. The partnership creates opportunities for STEM education and workforce development for indigenous and other students living in the areas around several of the Group\u2019s wind plants in the southern part of the province. The project includes \u201cexperiential learning days\u201d for Piikani Nation students and the opportunity to visit Lethbridge College and get more information about both the WTT program and other university programs and services. We are also funding awards under the WTT program to support Piikani Nation students, indigenous and non-indigenous, who graduate. The involvement of these young people will include: safety training in the college\u2019s wind turbine shop; a climbing experience in a wind turbine nacelle; a visit to the top of a wind turbine using virtual reality (VR) technology; the construction of miniature wind turbines, tested in the college\u2019s wind tunnel; and the development of a virtual reality tour of the college\u2019s nacelle, through the donation of two VR visors.\n\u201c\u00c8 viva la scuola lab\u201d, Helpcode \u2013 ITALY\n\nThe project, now in its second year in 2022-2023 and realized in partnership with Helpcode, aims to support schools in their educational activities, through an integrative training proposal and the enhancement of curricular teaching, also with the objective of increasing students\u2019 awareness of the Group\u2019s main commitments, such as energy transition, digitalization and human rights.\n\nThe project is structured by developing three modular macro-activities: 120 workshops for classes, specific training for teachers and 10 \u201cEnergy for the Future\u201d activities. Workshop activities were, where possible, conducted in the presence of Helpcode educators with the contribution of our volunteers. The paths aim to guarantee the children\u2019s right to global citizenship education and sustainable development through exploration, interaction and play, including the use of digital platforms and educational software.\n\nThe workshops that remain active for this new release are:\n- CODE AND CHANGE YOUR WORLD!, dedicated to coding and digital literacy;\n- THE ALGORITHM OF RIGHTS, dedicated to rights and active participation.\n\nNew in this edition is the \u201cEnergies for the Future\u201d workshop path, which was realized using products powered by renewable sources and recycled materials, and providing specific training reserved for a local association to ensure the continuation of the project independently thanks to the skills acquired.\n\nIn 2022, the project involved about 150 children.\n\nSOCIAL AND ECONOMIC GROWTH\n\nBet on water in La Guajira \u2013 COLOMBIA\n\nIn 2022, Enel Colombia built the Amalipa micro aqueduct, which provides 600,000 liters of drinking water per month to more than 2,450 Wayuu indigenous people from 22 communities in Maicao and Uribia. This work is in addition to the Wimpeshi micro-water pipeline, inaugurated in February 2021, which consists of two reservoirs and 13 tanks that provide 2,000 liters of water per week to rural communities scattered across middle and upper Guajira. The project currently benefits almost 3,000 indigenous Wayuu people.\n\nAs of 2022, we have been awarded the role of partner for the construction of a new micro water pipeline in the Jai-paichon and Urraichipa territories in the municipality of Maicao, which will provide drinking water to more than 4,000 people in 39 Wayuu communities.\n\nIn addition, we commissioned the drinking water treatment system in the community of Media Luna Jawuaou in Uribia, benefiting 2,318 people.\n\nFinally, four tanks were built and handed over to the municipality of Maicao; these were developed together with the ACDI/VOCA Foundation for Latin America, the Ministry of Housing and the Colombian National Army. Almost 560 people from the communities of Chuluita, San Luis, Sabana Larga and Corralito benefited. These four jag\u00fceyes are in addition to the 10 we have delivered since 2020.\nSustainability Wonders \u2013 Enhancement and awareness for sustainable energy\n\nSustainability Wonders is the platform of the Global Business Line Enel Green Power and Thermal Generation that, since 2021, collects, enhances and shares the best sustainability challenges. During 2022, the program saw the launch of three contests dedicated to three different issues, in which all Enel people, in all countries, participated by submitting their sustainability project on each theme. The first of the three contests was dedicated to SDG 8 and supporting local entrepreneurship through initiatives that generate a positive and sustainable economic impact on the communities in which we operate. The winning project, which is Italian, provides vocational training courses on energy transition for the staff of companies in the Civitavecchia area, where the Torrevaldaliga Nord power plant is located.\n\nThe second contest, focused on SDG 15 and dedicated to the conservation of biodiversity, featured Brazil\u2019s initiatives on food and water security, agricultural production, sustainable fishing and mining that contribute to the fight against global warming. The project has restored more than 610 hectares with the planting of local flora. A total of more than 1,200 animal species \u2013 26 of which are threatened and 80 endemic \u2013 were recorded in the areas covered by the various projects. Finally, the last contest launched in 2022 focused on SDG 3, and gathered initiatives aimed at the psychophysical well-being of the individual. In this latter contest, the winning project, which originated in Italy but has become global, is \u201cEnel CReW, Cycling Running & Walking\u201d, which encourages virtuous mobility behavior and is currently active in 18 countries, with 145 clubs and almost 3,000 participating colleagues who have so far covered a total of more than 2 million kilometers, avoiding the emission of more than 350 million tons of CO\u2082 into the atmosphere.\n\nMargherita Moscatelli\nHead of Engagement and Performance\nEGP&TGx Sustainability\n\n\u201cThe Sustainability Wonders program was born from the desire to select the best sustainability projects implemented in the vicinity of our generation plants, in order to highlight and champion them, through an innovative and participatory process that involves and engages colleagues from all Countries\u201d\nBelow the 2022 results related to the targets of the previous 2022-2024 Sustainability Plan, the resulting progress and the targets of the 2023-2025 Sustainability Plan, which may be redefined, added to, or surpassed with respect to the previous Plan.\n\n| SDG | Activities | 2022 results | Progress | 2023-2025 targets | Tag |\n|-----|------------|--------------|----------|-------------------|-----|\n| 9   | Further enhance the reach of our innovation ecosystem, to find the best solutions on a global scale | 194 Proof of Concept launched | \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf | Launch of 445 Proof of Concept to test innovative solutions in the period 2023-2025 | I S G T |\n| 17  | Generate value by solving the ever-increasing needs of the Business Lines, by enabling open innovation tools (collaboration with startups, crowdsourcing, partners, universities, intelligence, technological communities, solution design activities) | 60 solutions adopted in the business | \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf | Scale-up of 126 solutions to accelerate the implementation of the Strategic Plan in the period 2023-2025 | I S G T |\n\n**Read more**\n\nProof of Concept are small-scale tests of a potential innovative solution, useful for assessing its feasibility and large-scale implementation.\nInnovation\nIn a world in which companies continue to change workflows and are becoming increasingly digital, we are concentrating on new technologies and are continuing to work toward giving life to sustainable progress.\n\nIn order to encourage new uses of power and new ways of managing it and making it accessible to increasing numbers of people in a sustainable way, we have made innovation a key component of our strategy. It is a pathway that involves traditional businesses and the development of new models and technologies, which leverage on cutting-edge innovation, passion and ideas that emerge not only from within, but also from outside the Company.\n\nEnel\u2019s Open Power model considers innovation as one of the four values that inspire our day-to-day actions, together with trust, responsibility and proactiveness.\n\nWe support innovation to be certain that the best and most creative ideas help improve the lives of people. By just rethinking the way in which we innovate we can truly revolutionize the industry and develop technologies and solutions that can shake up old markets and create other completely new ones.\n\nSince 2021, the culture of innovation was combined with an \u201cagile\u201d approach, with the objective of providing the business with 360\u00b0 support, from the initial idea of a project to its adoption phase, through the use of creativity, lateral thinking and agile techniques.\n\nInnovation and agile transformation have in fact a great potential for synergy as they are essential factors behind the creation of a competitive advantage and for the optimization of costs over time.\n\nEnel\u2019s Open Innovability\u00ae for changing the future of energy\n\nThe new model (Open Innovation + sustainability) is based on the crowdsourcing activities of the best talents, ideas and technologies to make them grow, transforming them into new business models. In this way, we are connecting all Company areas with startups, industrial partners, small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), research centers, universities and entrepreneurs, through the openinnovability.com platform, to face new challenges, in consideration of the drivers of the Group\u2019s Strategic Plan and the sustainable development goals (SDG) of the United Nations 2030 Agenda.\n\nSince 2017 we have launched the openinnovability.com platform, with more than 13,000 evaluated opportunities, more than 210 challenges, 34 of which only in 2022. Over the past year, the challenges for which the most solutions were proposed concern: innovative ways for improving the albedo in solar generation plants, sustainable approaches for reusing cement, a new design for primary and secondary substations. Those who propose solutions for solving the challenges can win monetary awards and start collaborations with the Group.\nWe can count on a global network of Innovation Hubs and Labs (10 Hubs, three of which are also Labs, and three Labs dedicated to startups) that collaborated with the local ecosystems to expand our vision, promoting open innovation and sustainability.\n\nThe Hubs, which are located in the most relevant innovation ecosystems for the Group (Catania, Pisa, Milan, Silicon Valley, Boston, San Paolo, Madrid, Barcelona, Santiago de Chile and Tel Aviv), handle a network of relations with all players involved in innovation activities and are the main source of scouting for startups and SMEs, with the objective of responding to the innovation needs of the Business Lines. The scouting activity also focuses on promoting the adoption of solutions that can maximize our sustainable profile, such as promoting circularity, guaranteeing inclusiveness and attempting to face social problems.\n\nThe Labs make it possible for startups to work alongside the technicians and experts of our Business Lines in order to develop and test solutions in the most fertile environment possible. In addition to the laboratories in Milan, Pisa, Catania, San Paolo and Be'er Sheva, in September 2022 we inaugurated the new AI & Robotics Lab in Tel Aviv, which is specialized in developing artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics for renewable energies and energy networks. This is the fourth innovative initiative launched by the Group in Israel and is managed by Enel Green Power and Enel Grids (the Group Business Lines dedicated to the generation and distribution of clean energy).\n\nOpen Innovation also means creating partnerships with key players. We are currently committed to 43 collaborations for innovation that cover the areas that are the most strategic for the Group and that concentrate on relevant topics, such as the new sustainable materials for Enel assets (Novamont), innovative technologies for improving the generation and storage of renewables (BASF), the promotion of space applications in the energy sector (ESA and Thales Alenia Space) and the codevelopment of innovative digital solutions (Cisco and Microsoft).\n\nWe have created specific interfunctional work groups (Innovation Communities) in order to face topics relevant for the business and new technologies and create value in an innovative manner. The active communities concern the following topics: blockchains, drones, energy storage, the metaverse, robotics, sensors and quantum computing. There are also work groups dedicated to so-called wearables, additive manufacturing, data monetization, AI and machine learning, materials and hydrogen. The Communities continuously monitor potential technological improvements and share new useful business models, added value services or use cases for types of technologies that could be adopted in various Group areas.\n\nWe constantly promote and spread the culture, knowledge and behaviors of Open Innovation in the countries in which we operate, favoring an approach called \u201clearning by doing\u201d, which allows people to think and act in a different way and disseminate methodologies and tools for strengthening the generation of ideas and supporting their development. There are many tools and initiatives for innovation that are useful for the dissemination of the Open Innovation culture. In addition to the recurring newsletters, surveys and webinars, periodic meetings are held with all Business Lines on many levels, not just managerial, but also with the non-hierarchical communities. We make the necessary resources available for promoting a culture of knowledge and its value on all levels, increasing awareness among people also thanks to training courses, events and meetings.\n\nISO 56002 standard \u201cInnovation management \u2013 Innovation management system \u2013 Guidance\u201d\n\nInnovation management is a strategic topic for organizations and companies, and the ability to manage innovation as a system and organize all the phases of the innovation process represents a critical success factor.\n\nIn August 2022, we were among the first companies in the world to voluntarily adopt the ISO 56002 standard for innovation management. This standard is part of a wider series of ISO 56000 standards and covers all aspects of innovation management: from the creation of an idea to its development on a global scale. By adopting this standard, organizations can consolidate their governance, increasing the effectiveness of innovation and therefore business opportunities, which in turn creates the conditions for a wide-spread innovation culture that stimulates the creativity of employees and stakeholders, and promotes the emergence of new valuable proposals, in line with market developments.\n\nThe standard is based on eight pillars: coherence with the Innovability\u00ae vision (innovation for the Company and a more sustainable world); generation of value through innovative ideas; future-oriented leadership and challenges to the status quo; innovation culture as a strategic asset; innovation development based on customer requirements; management of uncertainty and risk mitigation; proactiveness and resilience; systemic approach for a solid performance appraisal.\n\nFurthermore, in 2022 we signed an agreement with UNI (Italian Standardization Body) to draw up a public document known as \u201cReference practices\u201d, which has the purpose of making Enel a reference on a national level in Italy in the area of innovation governance.\nHow ideas are transformed into business solutions, creating shared value\n\nHere are some examples of Innovability\u00ae projects (see also chapters: \u201cClean electrification\u201d, \u201cCircular economy\u201d, \u201cConservation of natural capital\u201d):\n\n**Green hydrogen**\n\n**NextHy**: a global initiative designed to stimulate the growth of the entire green hydrogen ecosystem. Its center is the Hydrogen Industrial Lab in Sicily, an industrial technological validation platform that will be built between Carlentini and Sortino, where new technologies will be developed for accelerating the reduction of the cost of green hydrogen and the decarbonization of the so-called \u201cdifficult to abate\u201d sectors.\n\nNextHy is one of the Italian projects that benefited from the IPCEI Hy2Tech loan, the 4.5 billion euro fund made available by the European Union for the development of initiatives of strategic interest centered on hydrogen. The NextHy project also includes NextHy Booster, an acceleration program promoted by Enel Green Power that has the objective of supporting the most promising startups to scale their technology and their business to green hydrogen, creating a long-term partnership with Enel and connecting to the global network of green hydrogen.\n\n**Customer centricity**\n\n**Customer recognition through biometric factors** (Spain), such as, for example, vocal recognition, to guarantee safe and inclusive access to our services as an element for the authentication of customers at call centers, which improves the personalization of the service, emotional involvement and accelerating the resolution of customer requirements.\n\nPilot project for the application of advanced artificial intelligence models to improve the operation of contact centers (Italy, Romania, USA, Spain). These models personify the needs and language of our customers, generating concepts/phrases in hundreds of transcripts thanks to the pre-trained model. This is useful for testing the qualitative level of our operators, preparing ourselves, in the future, for new evolutionary sales scenarios, automatic training and proactive support.\n\nUse of neurosciences to obtain more in-depth information about the efforts customers make to understand the commercial communications and to simplify relationships, thanks to the interpretation of spontaneous physiological input (Italy).\n\n**Robots and safety**\n\n**Innovative robots** for inspections of submarine cables (Italy), operations at a height (Italy and Brazil) and for cutting vegetation (Brazil), to allow safe and remotely controlled/automatic interaction with network components for operating and maintenance activities, and to cut vegetation near the network.\n\n**New sustainable helmets** (Italy and Romania), that can house intelligent glasses for hands-free operation and other accessories to improve safety. They are more ergonomic and made with recycled material.\n\n**Smart City**\n\n**YoUrban** (Italy), a single point of access for using all Enel X solutions activated in the urban perimeter, from the digital management of public lighting system faults to the innovative City Analytics solution for optimal urban planning. In 2022, new functions were developed that provide a complete overview of communities and areas of improvement in terms of services for citizens, CO\u2082 and the degree of circularity.\nWeather predictions, variability of natural resources and system operation\n\nIn Italy, development of four parallel projects, selected thanks to the tender launched together with ESA (European Space Agency), that are concentrated on the development of algorithms for estimating the equivalent of snow water and the content of water in the alpine snowpack via satellite, to be validated with in situ measures. To best manage the production of water in our power plants, it is in fact necessary to know not only the amount of rain, but also the volume of water contained in the snowpack (Snow Water Equivalent), which is an important temporary reserve of winter precipitation. Therefore, by improving the prediction of precipitation and the resulting prediction of hydroelectric generation through the combination of satellite data, weather prediction models and in situ data, it is possible to manage the risks related to the variability in natural resources and optimize market strategies.\n\nThe photovoltaic plant in El Paso, Colombia: the objective of the project is to automate the acquisition process of the cloud coverage above the plant and provide intraday and intrahour predictions of radiation, using satellite images and sky-cams in machine learning algorithms. The need results from the intrinsic characteristics of the area, as the El Paso photovoltaic plant is located in an equatorial area where it is very difficult to evaluate the actual amount of clouds in the sky with normal weather prediction services.\n\nUse of water and biodiversity\n\nCollaboration with Reiwa Engine (Italy) for the automatic cleaning of photovoltaic panels without the use of water.\n\nIn the wind park of Gibson Bay, in South Africa, an innovative system for preventing the impact of bats and birds with wind generators was successfully tested by means of installing an acoustic deterrent device developed by the US startup NRG Systems, which made it possible to reduce the risk of mortality for local bats by 80%.\n\nNew solutions based on remote image detection systems (such as satellites and LiDAR) and artificial intelligence, are able to identify the presence of archaeological finds and vegetable species before opening the job sites, in order to protect biodiversity.\nThe innovation of the electricity grid to mitigate the environmental impact and improve its resilience\n\nEnel\u2019s Net-Zero strategy for the electricity grid sector is concentrated on reducing the CO\u2082 emissions from activities, reducing network losses and adopting circular, low-emission materials and components. An interesting direction of innovation of Enel Grids is in fact that of Sustainable Design and Resilience, targeted toward mitigating the environmental impact and improving the resilience of the network with new technologies and sustainable materials, in order to rethink the systems and components.\n\nThe pilot project of the sustainable pole was field tested in this sector. The solution was also tested by some Northern European DSOs. This is a new support for low and medium voltage. It is made of wood obtained from certified sustainable forests in order to reduce the carbon footprint of the electricity grid. The main structure is made with certified wood, whereas the external layer is comprised of 66% recycled polyethylene. The poles, thanks to the innovative combination of two materials, make it possible to save up to 130 kg of CO\u2082eq with the same dimensions of standard cement poles.\n\nThe utilized wood comes from certified sustainable forests where there is the obligation to guarantee and not alter the continuous growth of the forest, whereas the external layer of polyethylene seals the wood, protecting it from atmospheric agents, improving its fire resistance and preserving fauna from the electrical risk. The absence of impregnating material, which was used for the old wooden supports, represents an additional result in terms of sustainability, in line with the new directives issued by the European Commission.\n\nThe pilot project successfully tested mechanical resistance and resistance to aging, and was able to evaluate the operational installation and maintenance activities.\n\nFor in-depth information about the Group\u2019s activities concerning network infrastructures, see the chapters \u201cClean electrification\u201d and \u201cCircular economy\u201d.\n\n\u201cEnel Grids is taking another significant step toward the decarbonization of electricity grids, thanks to the pilot installation of cutting-edge sustainable poles. An innovative combination of pine or fir materials and with an external layer made of 66% recycled polyethylene. The new poles make it possible to save up to 130 kg of CO\u2082eq as compared to similar standard poles made of concrete and without the toxic materials used in the old products. This is an important result for making our networks increasingly Net-Zero.\u201d\n\nLourdes Garc\u00eda Duarte\nHead of Sustainable Network Design and Resilience-Innovation\nEnel Grids\nNET-ZERO GRID\n\nFocusing on hydroelectric flexibility to accelerate transition and promote national energy autonomy\n\n\u201cThe role of hydroelectrics, a clean source par excellence, in the electrical system is becoming more important as an enabling technology for transition thanks to modernization and flexibilization projects developed in full compliance with the environment and local communities. This result was made possible by an intense and lengthy synergy with Generation, Innovation and the Territory.\u201d\n\nThe challenge we are facing is to explore capacities that are not yet expressed in terms of flexibility of use of the existing renewable fleet with innovative modernization, efficiency improvement and management interventions. With experimental modeling and the implementation of new operating schemes, which keep up with the continuous regulatory changes, we are aiming to test and highlight the pivotal role that the hydroelectric fleet can take on during the energy mix evolution process thanks to its extreme versatility and wide-spread presence all over the territory.\n\nIn 2022, the first phase was completed with a 5-year time schedule of initiatives that basically involved the most of the Italian programmable hydroelectric fleet with a specific investment plan. For some it was an extension of potential in terms of regulation and flexibility of use, whereas for others it was a true start in a new activity; the purpose of it all is to guarantee also with hydroelectric a continuous service for the electricity grid oriented toward balancing the intermittence generated by NPRS (non-programmable renewable source) thereby favoring the safe penetration of new capacity.\n\nIn particular, in Italy, the increase in terms of MW enabled for the secondary regulation service was more than 550 MW approx., equal to 11% approx. of the total currently enabled for all technologies in Italy. Furthermore, approx. 50 plants, for a total of 650 MW approx. have been enabled for the market of services also through aggregations and innovative modeling.\n\nAs is known, 2022 was a year with strong geopolitical tensions, but also a record shortage in the hydroelectric resource, causing considerable increases in production costs and unexpected reductions in availability of some thermoelectric plants.\n\nIn this context, the plants involved in the efficiency improvement and flexibilization program have provided a considerable contribution with regard to the safe management of the electricity grid and the containment of system charges, especially during the most critical periods.\nSustainable innovation and intellectual property\n\nIn the Open Innovability\u00ae ecosystem, Intellectual Property (IP) plays a key role in protecting and enhancing the value of the innovative solutions created and developed in-house or in collaboration with third parties. IP is a key component to regulate and foster the sharing of ideas, technologies and knowledge between Enel people, startups, universities, research centers, suppliers, and consultants.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, the IP portfolio, which ensures protection from a geographical point of view on all the markets in which the Group is present, contains:\n\n- **883 patents for industrial invention**, belonging to 163 technology families; of these, 711 have been granted and 172 are pending\n- **23 utility models**\n- **194 designs registered**\n- **2,027 trademarks**, of which 1,642 have already been registered, and 385 are pending\n- **194 trade secrets** of a technical and commercial nature that are constantly coded and kept in line with the requirements of the internal Trade Secrets Management organizational procedure\n\nAs part of the activities aimed at protecting and developing the portfolio of trademarks owned by the Group, notably, in the year of Enel\u2019s 60th anniversary, in addition to the registration of the \u201cEnel 60 years\u201d mark, the procedure for registering the Enel brand in the Special Register of Historic Trademarks of National Interest was initiated. This important recognition is awarded, following the submission of a special application, to trademarks that have been registered for at least fifty years, or for which there is proof of their continuous use for at least fifty years, and that are used to market products or services made in a national production company of excellence with long-term links to Italy.\n\nOther notable achievements include the registration of trademarks that identify models operating in the field of sustainability, such as:\n\ni. **Valuability\u00ae** of the model, copyrighted by Enel SpA, aimed at fostering the inclusion at work and active participation of colleagues with disabilities;\n\nii. **CirculAbility\u00ae** of the model \u2013 also copyrighted by Enel SpA \u2013 for measuring circularity.\n\nEnel has consolidated its processes for managing the generation and use of intellectual property rights in the Intellectual Property Management and Trade Secrets Management organizational procedures. Both of these view human capital as an essential element in the creation of IP and aim to incentivize employee participation in the inventive process, empowering them on the strategic importance of all findings.\n\nThrough the IP Reward Program, prizes and awards, including monetary ones, are paid to Enel inventors of solutions protected (or in the process of being protected) by patent, design, copyright or trade secret. As part of the IP Reward program, the first edition of the Enel Intellectual Property Awards were held on November 29, 2022, where the inventions protected by intellectual property and deemed most strategically relevant to the Group were honored. These initiatives, together with regular internal communication and awareness-raising activities, have also contributed to an increase in the number of inventions proposed by employees through the company IP portal.\n\nDuring 2022, intellectual property codification and protection activities continued in all the Global Business Lines. In particular:\n\n- **Enel X Global Retail** focused its activity on strategic platforms, codifying copyrights on the Big Data Platform, the strategic data container for all Enel X business units, and X Customer, the global Enel X customer management system.\n\nWith regard to the circular economy, the circularity schemes in Enel X, together with their scores and operating mechanisms, have been protected under copyright law.\n\nIn the field of telemedicine, a multiple design mark was registered in the European Union on the graphical user interfaces of the \u201cSmart Axistance eWell\u201d app, which offers users a complete wellness package.\nIn **Enel Green Power and Thermal Generation**, the following notable developments were achieved during the year:\n\n- in the photovoltaic sector, (i) a patent application for an industrial invention and a design patent on a solution that automates the process of installing photovoltaic panels in the field, reducing installation time and costs and increasing operator safety; (ii) a patent application in co-ownership with the Commissariat \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9nergie Atomique et aux \u00c9nergies Alternatives (CEA) on a system to optimize the automatic removal and insertion of the wafer bar holder of the storage tray used to process wafers in chemical hoods. In addition, the generation and protection, mainly in the form of trade secrets, of the technological know-how required for the Gigafactory project continues at the 3SUN factory.\n\nCEA-INES is one of Europe\u2019s leading photovoltaic research institutes. A collaborative research agreement was negotiated and signed with the institute for the development of the two-terminal Perovskite-silicon tandem technology, with the aim of producing high-efficiency devices that can be industrialized on the lines of the Gigafactory in Catania. The management of the IP rights arising from the collaboration was a crucial factor in the negotiation of this agreement, which is based on the strong technological background of the two partners;\n\n- in the field of hydroelectric generation, a utility model patent application for a robotic solution that facilitates plant inspections by enabling access to all places that are difficult for personnel to reach, such as hydroelectric coils or small-diameter hydroelectric pipelines.\n\n**Enel Grids** filed two patent applications for inventions in 2022: one in the field of asset recognition and anomaly detection of grids and grid events (ODIN project) and the other in the field of safety devices for workers working at height. Other noteworthy events included: (i) the registration of the design of the new sustainable road cabin, which will be developed using recycled materials to reduce environmental impact, and (ii) the filing of a utility model patent application in the field of safety, consisting of a method for delimiting road construction sites. Also during the year, Gridspertise consolidated its IP portfolio by filing a patent application for the Quantum Edge \u2013 QEd\u00ae device, which, by exploiting edge computing to digitize the physical components of secondary substations, reduces installation, training, operation and maintenance costs and increases network reliability. Enel Grids concluded two major licensing agreements with Gridspertise in 2022 for the commercialization of some of its key digital assets, including the Grid Blue Sky solutions. These agreements constitute a milestone in the valorization of Enel Grids\u2019 intellectual property through an out-licensing strategy. Gridspertise will participate within the framework of these agreements as a commercial and technical partner, offering customized versions of licensed digital solutions to meet the specific needs of third-party DSOs.\n\nIn May 2022, Enel Grids founded the \u201cOpen Power Grids\u201d association, for the first time making its historical wealth of expertise and experience on distribution networks accessible free of charge to member operators outside the Enel Group. The objective of Open Power Grids is to create a collaborative ecosystem to foster innovation, aggregating experiences, ideas, technologies and resources to make electricity grids more resilient, sustainable and participative, also based on a market-driven standardization process. In this way, the initiative can help improve the effectiveness and measurability of the concrete actions taken by Enel to achieve the Net-Zero ambition. The proposed approach is to provide open access, within the association, to the existing functional specifications (of electricity grid components and devices and network design solutions) on which Enel Grids holds copyright and, based on these, to develop new ones, in a logic of co-design, maximizing the aspects of sustainability, standardization and innovation.\n\n**Enel X Way** protected the JuiceBox DC and JuiceBox 4.0 smart home charging devices respectively through: (i) an international design registered in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States and (ii) an international design registered in Canada, Mexico and the United States. Intellectual property protection work on electric vehicle charging stations also extended to the registration of the JuiceMedia 2.0 and JuiceMod product designs in the European Union and the United States. In the field of electric car charging points, Enel X Way pursued the goal of inclusiveness by designing infrastructures that take into account the needs of motorists with reduced mobility. In fact, in collaboration with ANGLAT, the national trade association that protects the rights to mobility of people with disabilities, and following the criteria of Universal Design, Enel X Way has created an additional maneuvering area marked on the ground by zebra stripes and featuring bollards to protect the infrastructure from possible impacts. With the intention of promoting the project and facilitating its usability by as many users as possible, Enel X Way enhanced the intellectual property of the designs through the open property model with author protection through Creative Commons. Specifically, Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial licenses were applied, which allow third parties to download and use the designs free of charge.\nEnel Global Services filed a patent application in Italy for an industrial invention on the innovation management method, also protected as the word mark Enel OOPS...! Innovation\u00ae. This method is based on perfecting industrial processes using the tools of Open Innovability\u00ae.\n\nEnel SpA also filed a patent application in Italy for a method of evaluating managerial positions, based on a model capable of acquiring and processing personnel management parameters using a proprietary algorithm, thus providing a meaningful index that meets the needs of the People and Organization Function.\n\nMore generally, the Group continues to invest resources in the development of IP-intensive solutions, mainly in the forms of authorship protection and trade secrecy on databases and algorithms for forecasting the electricity and gas markets, advanced quantitative models that use, among other things, scenario data to assess the impact of climate change on specific assets/production activities. The most notable investments in this area include development models that aim to: (i) characterize an asset\u2019s ability to \u201cwithstand\u201d the possible effects of climate change; (ii) quantify the likelihood of an event or combination of climate events damaging the asset; and (iii) provide an index of the asset\u2019s \u201cweakness\u201d with a specific technical approach to prioritize actions/fields for improvement.\n\nFinally, during the year, the Group consolidated its internal non-financial intellectual property reporting process based on an internal proprietary methodology capable of codifying, protecting and valuing corporate intangibles. This methodology aims to provide a qualitative assessment of the intellectual property and an indication of the investment that would be required to replicate the set of intangibles subject to codification.\nBelow the 2022 results related to the targets of the previous 2022-2024 Sustainability Plan, the resulting progress and the targets of the 2023-2025 Sustainability Plan, which may be redefined, added to, or surpassed with respect to the previous Plan.\n\n| SDG | Activities                                                                 | 2022 results                                      | Progress | 2023-2025 targets                                      | Tag |\n|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----|\n| 4   | Disseminating the IT security culture and changing people\u2019s behaviour in order to reduce risks | 19 cyber security knowledge-sharing events executed | \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf      | 15 cyber security knowledge-sharing events executed each year | S   |\n| 9   | Information security verification activities (Ethical Hacking, Vulnerability Assessment, etc.) | 1,587 verification activities carried out          | \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf      | 1,400 verification activities each year               | T   |\n| 11  | Execution of cyber exercises involving plants/industrial sites            | 50 cyber exercises carried out                    | \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf      | 186 cyber exercises in the period 2023-2025           | S   |\n\n**Cyber exercises** are drills aimed at simulating a cyber security incident, carried out with the objective of training the reaction capacity of the involved subjects and testing the processes and technologies in the field. The exercises are conducted by Enel\u2019s Cyber Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) and involve both technical and business reference structures. The simulation performed generates awareness and addresses possible needs for improvement of technical or organizational aspects.\n| SDG | Activities | 2022 results | Progress | 2023\u20132025 targets | Tag |\n|-----|------------|--------------|----------|-------------------|-----|\n| 12  | Activities to reduce CO\u2082 emissions | -54.8 mil printed pages (vs. 2019) | \u2b24 \u2b24 \u2b24 | -17 mil printed pages in 2025 (vs. 2019) | E S T |\n| 13  | 7.3 mil hours of downtime outside normal working hours | \u2b24 \u2b24 | Activities to reduce PC, laptop and monitor downtime | E S T |\n| 9   | Reuse and exchange of information in the e-API Digital Ecosystem | 63 new e-API interconnections | \u2b24 \u2b24 \u2b24 | 100 new e-API interconnections in the period 2023\u20132025 | S T |\n\n**Read more**\n\nThe e-API Digital Ecosystem is the digital environment through which all the companies of Enel Group can easily, quickly and automatically share information normally confined within specific vertical applications (\"silos\" of information). Thanks to the enabling technology of the API (Application Programming Interface), Enel\u2019s data flows and functionalities are treated as \u201cdata-as-a-product\u201d, fostering sustainability through a real reuse and exchange of information and a reduction of time and resources needed.\nDigitalization\nTechnology is essential in order to innovate, guide and enable the creation of sustainable development models. Indeed, digital technologies, both established and cutting-edge, contribute significantly to improving energy efficiency, decarbonization, and the development of automated business and production processes, thus promoting the circular economy and new business models. Through such platforms, increasing levels of scalability and efficiency can be achieved, reducing marginal costs. Specifically:\n\n- our global digital platforms promote the growth of renewable energy by providing common interfaces and smart solutions, thanks to technologies such as Digital Twin and Artificial Intelligence, which improve business development, engineering and construction, operation and maintenance;\n- improving service quality, efficiency and the resilience of our grid infrastructure is driven by a single digital platform, Grid Blue Sky, which standardizes and optimizes the engineering, operation and maintenance phases and places the customer at the heart of every activity;\n- our global customer base is managed by the Customer Operations platform, which renders the customer support, service activation, payment and billing processes smart, replicable and automated. We also leverage Enel X\u2019s digital platforms to globally offer innovative products and services for the B2C, B2B and B2G segments;\n- the working life of all our people is increasingly supported by digital, allowing them to focus on higher value-added activities and ensuring their security.\nSustainable digitalization and digital for sustainability\n\nIn our digital transformation, we aim to use digital solutions as tools for the development of a sustainable future, and to develop them on the basis of sustainability criteria. The main actions taken in 2022 concerned:\n\n\u2022 decarbonization and reduction of emissions linked to digital solutions;\n\u2022 circularity of the digital devices and materials comprising the digital assets of the Group;\n\u2022 promotion of social inclusion through the development of assistive technologies and solutions that ensure accessibility and generate value by meeting local needs;\n\u2022 promotion of best environmental performance and adoption of human rights principles with the suppliers of digital products and solutions. For more information, see the chapters on \u201cManaging human rights\u201d and \u201cSustainable supply chain\u201d.\n\nSeveral challenges have been launched on the openinnovability.com platform with a view to incorporating environmental considerations in their resolution (see chapter on \u201cInnovation\u201d).\n\nFurthermore, in line with the 2030 decarbonization targets, a number of criteria based on Global Warming Potential were included in tenders for digital professional services in 2022, which allow participants with lower greenhouse gas emissions in terms of CO\u2082eq to gain a higher technical score.\n\nIn 2022, we drafted and published our Digital Sustainability Policy, which establishes the sustainability orientation of the Group\u2019s initiatives and considers digital to be a key factor. With this Policy, we are committed to ensuring that the Company\u2019s digital solutions comply with sustainability criteria, as well as promoting the sustainable use of technology in all business processes, at all stages of the initiatives and in the different countries of the Group.\n\nWe also launched a project in 2022 to create a corporate framework in which to assess and mitigate the ethical risk related to the use of artificial intelligence and ensure its safe and efficient use, in line with legislative changes at European level.\n\nPLATFORMS: ensuring a rapid and effective response to continuous change\n\nThe new Company strategy that transforms complexities into opportunities\n\n\u201cPlatforms play a key role in the Company in that they build trust for all our colleagues. They make it possible to share knowledge, enabling new operational and business models.\u201d\n\nThe digital platforms are one of the pillars of Enel\u2019s strategy, since they are, together with the ecosystems, tools based on maximum information sharing and mutual trust. Being platform-oriented allows us to create a competitive advantage as digital platforms enable new operational and business models (e.g., sharing economy).\n\nThe Enel Digital Platform is the final step in realizing Enel\u2019s full digital potential: it allows easy access to all Company databases, breaking down silos and information barriers, and fostering collaboration and digital sustainability. The reuse of data and conscious software development have a direct impact on the reduction of carbon emissions.\n\nThis Enel Platform will be an ecosystem of technologies, methodologies, services and skills deeply embedded in the corporate culture. The goal is to foster participative and strongly data-driven digital development ecosystems, based on an agile approach to operations and the use of cloud technology.\n\nFor this reason, in 2022 Enel decided to launch the Platform School initiative to spread the potential of Platformization among all Enel people through a \u201ctrain the trainer\u201d educational model: in-house trainers, skilled in sharing strategic concepts, guide the transmission of knowledge through video and bitesize information materials.\nKey drivers of the digital transformation\n\nCloud computing\n\nThe cloud represents a fundamental strategic enabler which allows us to use IT resources (both in terms of infrastructure and applications) and which, by making full use of the access possibilities provided by the network, allows to reduce waste tied to the consumption of unused resources. The migration of applications to the cloud made it possible to significantly reduce the demand for energy and consequently the consumption of resources. From 2019 to date, while data storage and processing capacity have increased considerably, there has been a 52% reduction in CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nUnified Communications and Collaboration (UCC)\n\nServices such as instant messaging (chat), IP telephony, audio and video conferencing take full advantage of the sharing model which, through the internet, allows content to be shared and enjoyed from personal computers, smartphones or tablets, thereby reducing the need to travel and, in turn, lowering carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nData sharing and Enel Application Programming Interface (e-API)\n\nThe e-API ecosystem is the digital environment where all Group companies can share quickly and in real time \u2013 through standard interfaces and data paths \u2013 information that would normally remain confined to specific vertical applications (information silos). This ecosystem has helped speed up the adoption of digital solutions, reduce data redundancies within the Group and, more generally, reduce the amount of time and resources spent on exchanging information flows. A total of 63 new e-API interconnections were implemented in 2022.\n\nMachine learning and predictive maintenance\n\nWe adopt machine learning technologies to conduct predictive analysis in relation to the maintenance of electricity distribution networks and generation plants, identifying possible errors in advance and acting before faults occur on the main components. Reducing the risk of malfunctions has a significant impact not only in economic terms, but also in relation to the environment and personal safety. Therefore, using these technologies improves the quality of service provided, making it more sustainable over time, while ensuring an optimized use of internal resources and inspections focusing on the equipment most exposed to the risk of failure.\n\nCircularity of digital devices\n\nThe decommissioning of Company equipment generates waste, the disposal of which merits special attention. For this reason, the circular management of digital assets in the Group\u2019s various countries is achieved by safeguarding both the extension of the devices\u2019 service life, by selling them to employees or third parties (13,427 devices sold in 2022), and disposing of these devices in line with recycling principles, amounting to a total of 33 tons of equipment in 2022; devices categorized as electronic waste are disposed of at certain suppliers, who will then recycle the devices themselves.\n\nDigital Carbon Footprint\n\nIn 2022, we launched several initiatives to monitor and reduce digital-related emissions, mainly aimed at optimizing and consolidating the use of cloud infrastructure, promoting circular and sustainable management of digital assets, and encouraging the conscious and responsible development and use of software and hardware.\n\nIn this context, we developed a Digital Carbon Footprint Framework, which confirmed that with a 200% increase in the computational capacity of our systems and a 107% increase in data storage capacity, we were able to achieve a 26% reduction in CO\u2082 emissions from digital sources between 2018 and 2022.\nDigital for people\n\n\u201cDigital Sustainability\u201d school\n\nIn 2022, we made available to our people a training course on \u201cDigital Sustainability\u201d, consisting of 10 videos, to better understand how digital technology guides us towards achieving the UN 2030 Agenda\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. This training course, delivered in collaboration with the Digital Sustainability Foundation, also aims to raise awareness of behaviors related to the use of digital technologies, enabling us to understand the contribution we can make in our daily lives to sustainability. The videos are now available in five languages and have over 50 thousand views among Enel people around the world.\n\nAccessibility and inclusiveness in digital systems\n\nThe use of data and platform logic, coupled with the accessibility and inclusiveness of digital systems, allows access to new joint business models and the offer of new services and products, including to vulnerable customers.\n\nThe accessibility of digital solutions must be provided for at the design stage, which is why the Digital Accessibility organizational unit was created in 2022 in order to act as a point of contact for the Group and support the management of related initiatives and the development of digital products and services that are easy to use and compliant with the relevant regulations and standards.\n\nA new life for our PCs\n\nThe initiative to donate personal computers that have reached the end of their service life has been implemented with the aim of creating a positive social impact on public and private entities, which carry out various kinds of activities of social relevance and/or which pursue public benefit purposes. By giving PCs a new life, for the second year we are reinforcing our commitment to supporting communities in the countries where we operate, by promoting digital inclusion and enhancing the circular economy of digital devices, thereby extending the equipment\u2019s service life through reuse. 213 devices were donated in 2022.\n\nVideo communication\n\nMore than 7.3 million meetings\nMore than 639.3 thousand tons of CO\u2082 avoided\n\nPrinting service\n\n81 million pages printed\n5.8 tons of CO\u2082 produced\n\nThe printing service, based on new generation printer models set up for a more eco-sustainable use, continues to be in operation at all Group offices. Together with a more rational use of prints and digitalization, the service has made it possible to reduce paper consumption over the years and, in turn, reduce the impact on the environment.\n\n---\n\n(1) More than 7.3 million meetings in 2021, almost 5.1 million in 2020 and 244 thousand in 2019, respectively avoiding contributing 5875 thousand metric tons of CO\u2082 in 2021, 444.7 thousand in 2020 and 242.1 thousand in 2019.\n\n(2) 83 million pages printed in 2021, 88 million in 2020 and 136 million in 2019, which respectively produced 6.5, 8.4 and 12.5 tons of CO\u2082.\nIn 2022, we continued to monitor electricity consumption outside normal working hours\\(^{(3)}\\) of the IT workstations (desktops, laptops, monitors) of our people working in Italy. This was measured thanks to a Microsoft function (System Center Configuration Manager) on the workstations, which can identify when a workstation is on and not being used. Following the analysis, specific awareness-raising initiatives were defined, aimed at reducing electricity consumption. Also this year, there has been a decrease in the hours of inactivity. This is thanks to both our awareness-raising activities on energy efficiency and to the new IT tools made available to our people during the Covid-19 pandemic, which enabled a reduction in emissions. The greater use of mobile devices has in fact made it possible to reduce the number of fixed devices in the Group\u2019s offices and, in turn, cut down the amount of time that devices are on outside working hours.\n\n\\(^{(3)}\\) 12 million hours of use in 2021, 18 million in 2020 and 32 million in 2019, which respectively produced 77.4, 159.6 and 321.1 tons of CO\\(_2\\).\n\n\\(^{(4)}\\) Monday-Friday (from 7pm to 7am); Saturday and Sunday. Monitoring is not carried out on servers and personal computers which, by their nature, must be operational at all times. Specifically, the indicator represents the amount of CO\\(_2\\) associated with the electricity consumption of desktop computers, laptops and monitors, calculated after applying the average CO\\(_2\\) emission value per unit of electricity generated (gCO\\(_2\\)/kWh) in relation to the mix of sources present in Italy.\nTowards cyber-safe electrification\n\nIn the era of digital transformation, cyber security is taking on a key role in ensuring business operations. Typical cyber-attack types have changed radically in recent years: the number has grown exponentially, as has their level of sophistication and impact, making it increasingly challenging to identify the source in a timely manner. Sector studies confirm that the perception of cyber risk is continuously growing. As compared to previous years, the causes for increased cyberattacks also include geopolitical tensions. In fact the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has increased attention about this issue. In particular, all state security agencies have warned public and private institutions about potential IT threats against critical infrastructures.\n\nIn 2022, many of the world\u2019s major attacks were carried out by leveraging the supply chain and through compromised third parties, which allowed attackers to target the primary target\u2019s customers, partners, and suppliers. This caused a sharp rise in the number of victims and attacks went increasingly undetected (the so-called \u201cscale effect\u201d). It is also interesting to observe that the majority of the attacks in the energy sector include ransomware, an increasingly used method that causes the exfiltration (unauthorized copy, transfer or recovery) of the victim\u2019s data and its encryption, which gives the people responsible for the attack an additional lever for receiving payment of ransom.\n\nIt is also seen how the vulnerabilities detected in commonly used software products are continuously increasing and how they are taken advantage of with greater speed by cyber criminals. In particular, the zero-day type vulnerabilities represent a large risk because they are discovered before software developers become aware of them and before they can release a patch.\n\nIn a similar context of cyberwarfare, the only possible defense is given by processes and technologies, which have been developed and evolved over time to mitigate the IT risk. On top of constantly applying the cyber security strategy, we have set out special measures, also in order to reinforce the \u201ccyber security posture\u201d, aware of the fact that overall, cyber risks can become a risk of ecosystemic proportions within the broader context of the complex and interconnected electricity industry. For example, a large-scale blackout in this scenario would have socio-economic ramifications throughout the population, companies and key institutions.\n\nThe key elements are therefore sharing and cooperation on cyber security issues with participation among all stakeholders including companies, legal institutions, supervisory bodies, suppliers, customers, and employees.\n\nPolicies and management models\n\nIn line with the needs of the energy industrial sector and with the Open Power strategic approach that characterizes it, we have adopted a systemic vision of cyber security issues, as well as a global strategy of analysis, prevention and management of cyber security events. The cyber security path to support the Group\u2019s digital transformation is based on creating, enhancing and adopting a security governance model, infrastructure and services in order to make full use of opportunities \u2013 including with the help of cutting-edge technologies \u2013 to boost the cyber resilience of our infrastructure and applications.\n\nSince September 2016, the Cyber Security unit has been operating within Global Digital Solutions Function, reporting directly to the Chief Information Officer (CIO) who works under the Group Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). The unit is committed to ensuring the governance, direction and control of cyber security issues, establishing strategy, policies and guidelines in compliance with national and international regulations, engineering support for the protection of the Group\u2019s environments, monitoring of the risk posture through checks based on processes and technology, as well as monitoring and implementing compliance requirements tied to cyber security regulations, and adopting technical solutions and procedures to mitigate any weaknesses detected. The unit works synergically with the Business Lines and with the technical units responsible for systems design and management, thanks to the Cyber Security Risk Managers and Cyber Security Response Managers. CISO and the Cyber Security Risk Managers also make up the Cyber Security Operating Committee, which aims to evaluate cyber risks across the business and determine the risk acceptance criteria based on the Group\u2019s risk posture. The Cyber Security Committee, chaired by the Group\u2019s CEO and made up of his/her front lines, approves the cyber security strategy and periodically checks its progress. As determined at the meeting of April 2021, the Committee meets every six months. Two meetings were held in 2022 (May and October).\n\nIn 2022, the Control and Risk Committee held 3 meetings with the objective of addressing in more depth the aspects related to organizational procedures (on a technical and governance level), the crisis management process,\n\n---\n\n(5) \u201cCyber Security Posture\u201d refers to the state of society\u2019s adoption of cyber security principles.\nthe CERT operating model and the relative processes that characterize them. All areas actively participate in implementing the cyber security strategy by way of an integrated operating plan in line with the Group\u2019s objectives. Moreover, cyber security strategy and initiatives are a key focus area for the principal executive and control bodies (e.g. Board of Directors, Supervisory Bodies, etc.) for all the legal entities and Countries where the Group is present.\n\nMoreover, the Group policy adopted in 2017 (the \u201cCyber Security Framework\u201d) addresses the principles and operational processes that support a global strategy of risk analysis, prevention and management. This Framework, based on a \u2018systemic\u2019 vision applies across the more traditional Information Technology (IT) sector, as well as to Operational Technology (OT) environments tied to the industrial world and the Internet of Things (IoT). In applying this Framework, the Cyber Security Risk Management method was established in 2017. The method is applicable to all IT, OT and IoT environments and includes all of the phases required to carry out a risk analysis and define the related mitigation plan, in line with the stated cyber security goals. To balance the advantages obtained by the operation and use of IT/OT/IoT systems with the risk that can potentially derive from them, well-informed, risk-based decisions are of fundamental importance.\n\nEnel has also created a \u201cCyber Emergency Readiness Team\u201d (CERT) to ensure proactive management and responses to cyber incidents, while also encouraging collaboration and exchanges of information within a network of accredited international partners. Having entered into an agreement with the US national CERT, there are now 9 accreditations with: Romania, Italy, Chile, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Brazil, Spain, and the US. Enel\u2019s CERT is also part of Trusted Introducer \u2013 a service that includes 464 CERTs in 72 countries. In September 2018 Enel also joined FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams), which is the largest and most widespread community in the sector, with 602 members spread across 99 countries. Furthermore, in 2022 the CERT operating model was strengthened with the creation of an internal team of security analysts. The new operating model has exceeded the previous one, implementing the internalization of the incident monitoring and management activities and therefore, strengthening the activities 24x7.\n\n**Definition of the IT security strategy**\n\nThe cyber security strategy covers setting objectives and priorities to direct and coordinate investment initiatives for the Group as a whole, and to ensure adherence to cyber security policies, setting targets, management reporting, and constant monitoring of ongoing security activities. This process is guided by CISO and uses close integration and synergy with the various business areas, which communicate their needs, analyze opportunities, manage any criticalities, and make proposals for initiatives. Devising strategies is an iterative activity based on sharing and consolidation of the Group\u2019s risk posture target. The various actors involved analyze the options and potential initiatives within their respective business areas in order to assess the feasibility, guarantee consensus, and the necessary funds. The Cyber Security unit guides the process and, together with the other key players, gradually consolidates aspects such as future scenario, objectives, and possible strategic initiatives in a cyber security strategy proposal document, with a high-level budget estimate and prioritization.\nCyber security incident management\n\nThe multiplicity and complexity of the areas in which we operate (data, industry, and people) and of the technological components (e.g. business critical systems such as SCADA \u2013 Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition, smart grids and smart meters) increasingly integrated in the Group\u2019s digital life, have made it necessary to configure a structured cyber security system. This leads to the need for a cyber defense model based on a systemic vision that integrates the IT sector (starting from the cloud down to the data center and mobile phone), the OT (everything concerning industrial sector, such as generation plant remote control) and the IoT (extension of communication and artificial intelligence to the world of things).\n\nThrough the monitoring systems, CERT collects 3 billion events every day relating to the company\u2019s assets from 7 thousand data sources, correlates them through automatic analysis, and produces a hundred \u201cincidents\u201d on average. The incidents are classified based on the Enel Cyber Impact Matrix (on a scale of 0 to 4), making use of the best events correlation capabilities thanks to the adoption of highly advanced services.\n\nThe vast majority of \u201cincidents\u201d are classified as 0/1; these have no significant impact on Group systems and are automatically or semi-automatically intercepted and/or managed by the existing company defenses; this way they are able to prevent and/or mitigate the impact of potential cyber-attacks.\n\nIncidents classified as 2/3/4 have a potential impact on the Group and are managed by CERT analysts, involving any affected stakeholders. Thanks to the protection services, every day, in 2022 CERT intercepted on average 1.2 million at risk e-mails, 57 viruses, 172 web portal attacks, and 1.3 million connections to harmful websites every day.\n\nIn 2022 Enel CERT responded to: 175 cyber security incidents with impact level 2; 16 incidents with impact level 3; and 0 incidents with the highest impact level of 4.\n\nIn the cases detected, to ensure an efficient and rapid response and minimize the impact on people, services and assets, all the relevant management procedures have been put in place.\n\nSpecifically, when a cyber security incident translates into a potential data breach, the necessary actions are taken immediately, in line with the Enel Group \u201cPersonal Data Breach Management\u201d policy. Should a crisis situation arise that threatens the Enel Group\u2019s business continuity, assets, reputation and/or profitability, the appropriate actions are taken immediately, in line with the specific Group policy on \u201cCritical events management\u201d.\n\nMoreover, the \u201cIT Service Continuity Management\u201d policy formalizes a process to bring the risk affecting the availability of IT infrastructure down to an acceptable level, support business continuity requirements, and restore IT services based on the results deriving from a Business Impact Analysis when a severe interruption occurs, including when caused by an accident.\n\nEDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) technology blocks violations by using innovative features and advanced paradigms not only to identify viruses and malware on endpoints, but also to detect suspicious sequences of technical events that could prove to be part of an attempted attack.\n\nDetailed below is the number of cyber security events recorded in 2022.\n\n| KPI | 2022 |\n|-----|------|\n| Total number of cyber security breaches or other cyber security incidents | 0 |\n| Total amount of fines/sanctions paid related to cyber security breaches or other cyber security incidents | 0 |\n| Total number of customers and employees impacted by data breaches affecting the Group | 0 |\n| Total number of data breaches | 0 |\n\n(1) The value reported for the KPI \u201cTotal number of cyber security breaches or other cyber security incidents\u201d refers to Level 4 incidents.\n(2) The KPI \u201cTotal number of data breaches\u201d refers to the number of events that occurred as a result of a cyber security incident (i.e. the number reported does not include any disclosures occurring as a result of non-digital incidents).\n\nFurthermore, in order to boost our capacity to prevent, react to and manage incidents, some cyber exercises simulating a real attack were carried out, involving staff working in the production environments. At the end of each exercise, reports were produced containing details of the actions taken during the simulation, to assess \u2013 with a view to continuous improvement \u2013 the quality and completeness of the materials provided to help with decision-making, the execution times for each phase, and how well the procedures had been followed. In 2022, in particular, 50 cyber exercises were carried out in industrial environments in 11 Countries where the Group is present.\nMain projects and initiatives\n\nAll cyber security projects, programs, and initiatives are designed to avoid, mitigate or remediate cyber security risks for the entire Group. As a result, all activities are managed with a risk-based approach following the security by design principle to ensure a continuous due diligence process that also includes self-assurance activities.\n\nCERT \u2013 RISK MONITORING EXTENSION\n\n\u201cCERT \u2013 Risk Monitoring extension\u201d. CERT uses emergency technologies such as SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response) and machine learning to support Big Data, which make it possible to automate and streamline incident management activities and make use of improved visibility of cyber threats, increasing efficiency in managing new ones and the related investigations. In particular, thanks to the SOAR system, through the definition of operating flows it is possible to automate repetitive tasks, whereas through machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, it is possible to learn or improve detection capacities based on available data. These technologies make it possible to consistently accelerate, enrich and trace the necessary activities during the analysis and management phase of an incident, providing considerable support to the analyst who can therefore parallelize and concentrate on more complex tasks that require human intervention.\n\nMULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (MFA)\n\n\u201cMulti Factor Authentication (MFA)\u201d is a cloud solution used to enforce the identification method for users during the authentication procedure. Adopting MFA enables a person accessing a system to identify himself/herself through a second authentication factor via SMS or an app installed on his/her smartphone. The MFA solution is in line with the regulatory framework and is strongly recommended to counter emerging threats of theft of credentials, including those using social engineering techniques (e.g., phishing or potential user behavior not in line with policy). The adoption of the solution is operational for all users.\n\nASSURANCE CHECKS\n\nAssurance checks (Ethical Hacking, Vulnerability Assessment). These activities are carried out on an ongoing basis both using automated tools and manually, to assess and quantify any weaknesses in IT, OT and IoT environments (applications, systems, IoT devices, architectures and/or infrastructures). 1,587 checks were performed in 2022. Following these checks, we can identify the best measures to eliminate or mitigate the detected vulnerabilities or threats and, in turn, any associated harmful exploits.\n\nDMARC \u201cE-MAIL FRAUD DEFENSE\u201d\n\nDMARC \u201cE-mail Fraud Defense\u201d. This solution completes the application map covering threats of spam, phishing and fraud attempts. Thanks to this, all of Enel\u2019s e-mail domains are configured to permit blocking e-mails with an incorrect sender address that exploits the Group brand. Deployment took place across the entire perimeter, thereby providing complete coverage of the domains.\nCollaborations with external bodies and agencies\n\nIn line with the Open Power approach, we believe that networking with external entities and organizations is a key element in the cyber security strategy, to share best practices and operational models, develop and strengthen information sharing channels, and help establish standards and regulations. In 2022, we provided feedback in public consultations to help draw up cyber security regulations, including by drafting legislations, promoting a harmonization of the current regulatory landscape in this area, and implementing a risk-based approach and the principle of security by design. Collaborations carried out also aim to construct more homogeneous structures for defining the taxonomy of security incidents, more organic criteria for their classification, as well as more harmonious notification procedures in European contexts. These collaborations are also guided by a complex regulatory landscape in the cyber security area, both in terms of an increase in standards produced as well as in terms of complexity, mainly due to the new regulations that are added every year, in addition to the heterogeneity of requirements and the methods of adoption.\n\nIn this sense, the process aimed at regulatory compliance can have a strong impact both on company processes as well as on the technological infrastructure, requiring a major effort in terms of management and monitoring. Moreover, taking into account the context of regulatory compliance, no cases of non-compliance with standards or cyber security regulations were detected in 2022.\n\nIn recent years, a solid network has been established and developed by interacting with key stakeholders in the energy sector such as ANEEL (Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Energia El\u00e9trica) and ONS (Operador Nacional do Sistema El\u00e9trico) in Brazil and CNO (Consejo Nacional de Operaci\u00f3n) in Colombia. We took part, for example, in the Confindustria Digitale team, which aims to help develop the Italian digital ecosystem, we participated in the working groups of the World Economic Forum, and contributed in recent years to the publication of several reports including \u201cCyber Resilience in the Electricity Ecosystem: Securing the Value Chain\u201d and \u201cCyber Resilience in the Electricity Industry: Analysis and Recommendations on Regulatory Practices for the Public and Private Sectors\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, Enel X, Gridspertise and Enel Grids have reached an important goal in the area of IT security by obtaining ISO 27001 certification. This important result certifies some processes that have an IT security management system \u2013 policies, procedures and guidelines for providing customers with trusted products and services.\n\nTraining and information\n\nThe \u201cCyber Security Awareness Program\u201d has become a constant and ongoing initiative at Group level; it used to disseminate our cyber security culture and raise awareness of threats and attacks that exploit the human vector. This program contributes in fact to digitalization, because it creates a culture of IT security, changes the behavior of people in order to reduce the cyber risk, develops technical IT security skills and makes people the first line of company defense. It also uses various communication channels and dissemination tools, including both communication campaigns as well as dedicated training initiatives for clusters of people. Specifically, 19 knowledge sharing events were held in 2022 on a Global level on the issues of cyber security and various initiatives were held also on a local level. For example, within the scope of these initiatives, Policy no. 1097 \u201cRules of Behavior for Digital People\u201d was integrated with a quick guide, available in all the main languages adopted in the Group (5 different languages) targeted towards facilitating a quick consultation of topics for directing the correct use of digital resources. Bulletins and news were also created and disseminated through the company intranet and documents were made available to stay always up to date on these issues. All of this was made possible also thanks to the awareness platform \u201cTheRedPill\u201d, the Group platform through which training content and modules are delivered in order to strengthen the IT security culture, allowing the continuous improvement of training initiatives and the performance of simulated phishing campaigns. Its objective is to raise awareness of the main cyber security issues, address any upskilling and reskilling needs and teach how to defend against possible attacks. Four global simulated phishing campaigns, a knowledge assessment and an awareness campaign were launched in 2021 \u2013 the year the platform was updated. During 2022, additional initiatives were launched on a global level, such as the dissemination of the \u201cAntiphishing Kit\u201d module, or the launch of the \u201cPeople Cyber Empowerment Journey\u201d, or the program that aims to make Enel people the first line of IT defense. Furthermore, 6 simulated phishing campaigns, 3 awareness campaigns related to digital identity protection, data and device protection, and 19 events targeted to disseminating the culture of IT security were designed and launched (so-called \u201cknowledge sharing\u201d).\nIn addition to the dissemination and communication initiatives, during 2022 the simulated phishing campaigns targeted toward the entire Enel population continued, in order to train employees to recognize malicious e-mails. Following the results obtained by the phishing campaigns, specific initiatives were created to increase employee sensitivity and awareness (for example, specific infographics, instructions and guidelines were shared with those who were not able to recognize a phishing e-mail).\n\nThe Open Tech Journey project also continued to provide access to training courses focused on technological topics, promoting internal skills to spread awareness of strategic topics and manage upskilling and reskilling needs. This was the background to the creation of the Cyber School, which delivered seven courses on the main cyber security topics. All the courses were engineered and made available to the entire Enel population in e-learning mode, in order to reach multi-specialistic skills in the various companies of the Group.\nBelow the 2022 results related to the targets of the previous 2022-2024 Sustainability Plan, the resulting progress and the targets of the 2023-2025 Sustainability Plan, which may be redefined, added to, or surpassed with respect to the previous Plan.\n\n| SDG | Activities                                                                 | 2022 results | Progress | 2023-2025 targets | Tag |\n|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------|-------------------|-----|\n| 8   | Circularity improvement                                                   | 56%          | \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf    | 78% in 2025       | I   |\n|     |                                                                           |              |          | 92% in 2030       | E   |\n| 12  | Economic CirculAbility (EBITDA/resource consumption)                      | N.A.         | N.A.     | x1.5 in 2025      | I   |\n|     |                                                                           |              |          | compared to the baseline year 2020 | E   |\n| 13  | Valorization of obsolete spare parts, equipment and scrap coming from the demolition of thermal power plants and promoting the adoption of circular business models | 22 million euros of revenues generated by Reselling and Recycling activities | \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf | 53 million euros of revenues generated from Reselling and Recycling activities in 2024(1) | I   |\n\nRead more\n\nThe Circularity improvement KPI measures the reduction in the consumption of fuel and materials of the Group\u2019s power fleet throughout their life cycle, compared to 2015.\n\nThe \u201cEconomic CirculAbility\u00a9\u201d KPI considers the Group\u2019s overall EBITDA (euros) and compares it with the amount of resources consumed, both fuel and raw materials, by the different business activities (tons).\n\nThe target on the Valorization of obsolete of spare parts, equipment and scrap coming from the demolition of thermal power plants involves the adoption of several initiatives, including the Spare parts and equipment New Life project, which aims to give new life to components in the warehouses, equipment of decommissioned coal-fired power plants and obsolete materials from all the other thermal power plants, allowing environmental and economic benefits.\n\n(1) Reselling and Recycling activities carried out on the basis of the progress of demolition work and scrap market value.\n| SDG | Activities | 2022 results | Progress | 2023\u20132025 targets | Tag |\n|-----|------------|--------------|----------|-------------------|-----|\n| 12  | Definition and application of suitable industrial and financial circularity metrics to support and enhance circular economy activities, engaging the respective business areas | A new KPI Economic CirculAbility\u00ae has been developed, measuring circularity at Group level by comparing the value generated (\u20ac EBITDA) against the consumption of resources (tons) needed to generate it.

In particular, the Working Group focuses on specific focuses, starting with the identification of raw material requirements for the Group\u2019s various activities, the identification of environmental and social impacts along the entire value chain, with particular reference to respect for human rights, the assessment of geopolitical risks (with potential disruptions to supply chains) and economic risks. The goal is the identification of priority areas of intervention in order to evaluate new solutions to mitigate risks and impacts related to materials and related technologies that use them, as well as the definition of specific targets for each raw materials supply chain and related action plan, leveraging the innovation ecosystem (co-innovation with suppliers, start-ups, etc.), prioritization ranking of raw materials and ad hoc plans for the most relevant ones, geopolitical, commodities, environmental and social risk reduction strategies on new technologies and business models. All these focus areas are carried out by comparing and examining the best practices of each industrial sector, monitoring and analyzing the market trends associated with raw materials for key technological sectors (wind, solar, batteries, networks, etc.) and by collaborating regularly with all relevant stakeholders.\n\nEnel\u2019s circular approach\n\nThe Group\u2019s circular vision is based on five pillars, which define the reference business models for the entire life-cycle of our assets and materials, and which act through three main levers: circular design, starting with the choice of input materials and design oriented towards life extension, up to the maximization of the use factor of the asset and its value at the end of its life; how the asset is used (circular use), which includes life extension, the use of sharing platforms, the product as a service; and closing cycles (value recovery), through remanufacturing and recycling and reuse of recovered materials as a new circular input.\n\n---\n\n(1) For example, according to the list in the \u201cEuropean Critical Raw Materials Act\u201d 2023, raw materials such as lithium and phosphorus.\nThe implementation of the Group\u2019s circular approach is based on the following main aspects:\n\n- design and non-waste management: choices made at the design stage strongly influence subsequent stages by enabling efficient management of the asset during its useful life and maximizing its recoverable value at the end of its life;\n- application in the core business: for change to be meaningful, it must first take place in the core businesses in order to make the Company circular;\n- economic sustainability: for solutions to be developed on an industrial scale, they must also be economically competitive;\n- measurement: only a quantitative approach linked to physical and economic indicators and challenging targets makes it possible to measure the effectiveness of the actions implemented and to guide business choices;\n- collaboration: in order to implement a circular solution, collaboration both within one\u2019s own sector, with suppliers, customers and all players in the value chain, and with other sectors, as well as collaboration with the innovation ecosystem (start-ups, universities, etc.) and institutions, is crucial;\n- innovation: innovation plays a fundamental role, not only technological innovation, but also innovation in business models, regulations, and modes of collaboration, for the realization of a new economic model. Innovative materials, artificial intelligence to enable predictive maintenance and the use of additive manufacturing to repair plant components are some of the technologies we are using to make our assets more circular. Start-ups, with their contribution of innovation and technology, play an indispensable driving role in the circular model (see the chapter \u201cInnovation\u201d).\nMain circularity projects\n\nWe are developing several projects mainly related to new assets (wind, solar, BESS, and grid development) and upcoming products/services for end customers, with the aim of reducing the consumption of raw materials, especially critical ones.\n\nThe initiatives focus on three of the five pillars of the model:\n\n- **Circular design \u2013 use of circular inputs**\n  Several solutions to reduce raw material consumption use circular inputs i.e., from previous life cycles (use of recycled plastic for smart meters and charging infrastructure for electric vehicles or recycled aluminum for street lighting systems) or by identifying new solutions that use alternative and more sustainable materials (wooden towers for wind turbines, innovative wind blades made of fabric, or hybrid towers in which the base and first sections are replaced by a concrete pedestal that will be made directly on site, significantly reducing the use of steel). Another project in this sense is the partnership with Vulcan Energy to develop projects for geothermal lithium extraction.\n\n- **Circular use \u2013 useful life extension**\n  Reducing the need for new assets also reduces the associated material requirements. Among the various initiatives implemented are the application of machine learning techniques for predictive maintenance in power generation and distribution plants or advanced repair technologies such as additive manufacturing.\n\n- **Value recovery \u2013 identification of new life cycles**\n  When an asset reaches the end of its useful life, the objective is to identify new life cycles through solutions that maximize the amount of recoverable materials in order to reinsert them into the production cycle. All the Group\u2019s different Business Lines are actively involved in major asset recycling projects: from PV with the Photorama project, which aims to recycle 95% of materials, to sale for scrap metal recovery, to the recycling of power line poles, reusing the recovered material for new poles, to the construction in Spain of a battery recycling plant with a target capacity of 8,000 tons/year, up to a circular management of the Group\u2019s decommissioned IT assets by giving them to employees, selling them to third parties or donating them for social purposes (see the chapter \u201cDigitalization\u201d). In addition, we are evaluating new models for the enhancement of secondary raw materials: for example, in Spain we are testing collaboration with plants authorized to process and recover scrap metal, in order to obtain secondary raw materials to be fed into new production cycles.\n\nHere are some examples of projects implemented:\n\n| Storage | Wind | Solar | Grid | Customer solutions | Cross |\n|---------|------|-------|------|--------------------|-------|\n| Geothermal lithium (Vulcan Energy) | Wind tower with wooden materials (3SUN) | Solar panels with recycled plastic | Circular Smart Meter with recycled plastic | Recycled plastic for EV charging stations | Materials passport |\n| BESS \u2013 New technologies for storage Thermal Energy Storage | Textile materials for wind turbine blades | Cell with copper replacing the silver (3SUN) | Recycled aluminum for public lighting systems | Sustainability K for procurement |\n| New storage technologies for storage: gravitational storage | Hybrid wind towers | Redesign of grid asset |\n\n| Circular DESIGN | Useful life extension | New life cycles |\n|-----------------|----------------------|----------------|\n| 2nd life Battery Melilla (Spain) | Project PIONEER (Italy) | EV batteries recycling |\n| Predicting failures software (IPCEI) | | Wind turbine blades recycling (Wind New Life) |\n| | | Solar panel recycling (Photorama) |\n| | | Grid mining |\n| | | Sale of natural gas |\n| | | New models for the enhancement of secondary raw materials from scrap metal |\nCircular procurement\n\nEnel\u2019s Circular Procurement strategy aims to improve the circularity of purchased products and services through the definition of metrics (such as the EPD system, Environmental Product Declaration) to assess the whole-life environmental impacts related to the material and energy flows of the strategic product categories purchased, co-innovation with suppliers, and the use of tender requirements and rewarding factors to incentivize suppliers to offer increasingly circular products. In addition, the Enel Group is developing tools and strategies to improve the tracking of materials along the value chain and to push suppliers to make efficient use of materials by focusing on recycling and recovery at the end of life and to increase transparency. See the chapter \u201cSustainable supply chain\u201d for more details.\n\nTechnological innovation in solar panel production (3SUN)\n\nThe new HJT (Hetero Junction Technology) solar module that will be produced in 2024 in the 3SUN Gigafactory in Catania, Italy, is a latest-generation double-sided photovoltaic module that guarantees less degradation of photovoltaic modules and extends their service life to more than 30 years. Due to its high efficiency (around 24%) resulting from the possibility of using larger and thinner wafers, it will already use a reduced amount of silicon for peak power. In addition, as a further evolution, a new HJT Tandem panel is being developed that will significantly exceed the state of the art in photovoltaic cells in terms of efficiency, reaching more than 30%; this will increase the efficiency of a conventional module by 15-20% and allow more energy to be generated, with the same number of modules installed, thus requiring less material such as polysilicon. In addition, technologies are being developed to introduce recycled materials into the production process (such as replacing panel glass with recycled plastic) and the possibility of replacing the silver (a material with a high environmental impact used in the metallization process of the cell) with copper is being evaluated.\n\nAndrea Tecci\nEcosystem and Circular Economy CC - EGP&TGx\n\n\u201cAt 3SUN we are working to increasingly improve the circularity of the PV module and minimize the consumption of raw materials, working on its entire life cycle: using circular materials, improving its productivity, extending its service life and finally maximizing the quantity of material that can be recovered at the end of its service life. The aim of all of this is to make this technology increasingly sustainable and competitive.\u201d\nBESS \u2013 New technologies for storage\n\nAgain with the aim of promoting the development of new, more sustainable materials and processes, a first innovative commercial alternative to chemical storage based on gravity technology will be installed. The plant will be commissioned in the United States in 2024. Specifically, the storage system will use excess electricity from the grid to move large blocks of cement material.\n\nAnother alternative solution that Enel installed in Italy at the end of 2022 is Thermal Energy Storage (TES) based on solid material and using rocks with high thermal capacity to retain thermal energy from the process fluid. Using common fragmented rocks, the TES system has the capacity to store up to 24 MWh of clean heat at a temperature of around 500 \u00b0C for at least 5 hours. All materials used (rocks, pipes and casings) are to be considered environmentally sustainable as there are no chemical compounds or critical or flammable materials.\n\nRedesign of grid asset\n\nSeveral initiatives are underway within Enel Grids, which also leverage an innovation ecosystem to improve the circularity of different assets through design and the use of new materials.\n\nThe search for solutions with a lower environmental impact for distribution poles has also led Enel Grids to explore alternative materials to conventional ones; in addition to the use of recycled aggregates for the manufacture of new poles, an analysis is underway for the use of wood poles free of toxic impregnating agents with a design oriented towards total recyclability at the end of their life. Alternative solutions to conventional construction methods are also being tested, with 3D printing and for pile foundations, in order to reduce installation times and material consumption (see the chapter \u201cInnovation\u201d).\n\nAlso thanks to the Open Innovability\u00ae platform, challenges were launched in 2022 to gather a new concept for the design of primary and secondary substations to promote their harmonious landscaping, the adoption of circular solutions in terms of both the materials used and the sharing of space with the community.\n\nCircular Smart Meter \u2013 Closed loop recycling\n\nFrom 2020, production of the new Circular Smart Meter began through a circular model and a pathway to redesign the value chain of the electronic meter, using material from discarded meters to make the new ones. About 2 million circular meters were produced in 2022. 48% by weight of the new meters are reclaimed materials: end-of-life recyclability (plastic, steel and other metals) is estimated at 79% by weight. Over its lifetime (15 years), each circular smart meter saves 7 kg of CO\u2082 and 1.1 kg of virgin material.\n\nCircular EV charging stations\n\nWe have been working for several years on the products in the Enel X Way portfolio by revising their design to improve their circularity. In fact, our main AC (alternating current) charging products use recycled polycarbonate as their main structural material (100% for JuiceBoxes and 75% for JuicePoles). For the JuicePole, AC public charging stations installed in 2022 alone amounted to 3,000 new points. The use of materials was also optimized, reducing the overall weight of the product by around 32%. Another example of a circular solution we have implemented is the recovery through remanufacturing of end-of-life components to be reused as spare parts.\nUseful life extension of batteries\n\nEnel is developing several solutions to extend the life of batteries, including the development by Enel X Enel X in the framework of an IPCEI project for artificial intelligence tools for predicting failures, anomalies and for modelling the degradation of lithium-ion batteries in order to extend their life and increase their reliability, optimizing operating and maintenance activity (project completion expected by 2023). A further strategy to extend the life of batteries from the automotive sector is to reuse them \u201csecond life\u201d solutions such as stationary storage systems. Enel has developed a first solution of this type in Melilla (4 MW/1.7 MWh storage plant), realized through the reuse of about 90 batteries, and is completing another one with a nominal capacity of 2.5/10 MWh as part of the PIONEER (airPort sustainability secOnD liFE battEry stoRage) project with Aeroporti di Roma.\n\n\u201cWind New Life\u201d project\n\nThe project proposes to develop a circular value chain to manage the end-of-life of wind turbine blades, through the development of two plants in Italy and Spain that will provide for the collection of the blades, their processing for production of second raw material and the reuse of the same for the production of high value-added components (building materials, sanitary and furnishing products, flooring, cabinets and electrical conduits). The Spanish plant, operational from 2025, will handle around 8,000 tons of material per year. In Italy, the aim is to manage around 3,000 of them by the second half of 2025.\n\nGrid Mining\n\nWith the aim of maximizing the contribution to decarbonization along the entire value chain, a Grid Mining & Zero Waste model has also been defined, which, by considering grid assets as a mine to be drawn from at the end of life, allows the recovery and market leveraging of precious metals and other materials and devices from obsolete distribution infrastructures. In this regard, to ensure a complete tracking of the materials contained in the network assets from the input phase of the value chain, we have developed and digitalized in our systems the \u201cDigital Product Passport\u201d (DPP) that allows us to have a clear and detailed picture of the different types and quantities of materials in use. The DPP allows not only for monitoring any materials considered critical, for which it might be useful to evaluate an alternative, but also for defining ex ante end-of-life reuse assumptions. In this regard, the End of Life Dashboard was developed as part of the Grid Mining strategy. Starting with reverse logistics information on the type and number of decommissioned grid assets, in close connection with the DPP, it gives us information on the decommissioned materials, their quantity and type, and the possible CO\u2082 savings related to their reuse as \u201csecond raw material\u201d. Having an integrated and digitalized tracking system along the entire value chain is the driving force toward the ambition to open our \u201cmine\u201d to the outside world as well, making it available to other companies or different sectors in order to involve their respective production chains and feed new markets for raw and secondary materials, promoting the development of the area and the saving of virgin materials, and creating new job opportunities related to waste material recovery initiatives while minimizing environmental impacts.\n\nThe recycling of photovoltaic panels (PV Recycling)\n\nAs far as the end-of-life recovery of photovoltaic panels is concerned, Enel is collaborating in the Photorama project (European Horizon 2020 program), which aims to automate the process of dismantling solar panels and to identify a handling process suitable for the recovery of valuable materials (purity greater than 99.9%), reaching a recycling rate of 95%. This solution will improve the recovery process in terms of both recoverable quantity and quality of the recovered material.\nCircular cities and territories\n\nCities generate around 70% of global CO\u2082 emissions, accounting for over 60% of resource use and produce 50% of global waste. Numbers are destined to grow, according to city population estimates. It is also necessary to maximize the effectiveness of interventions in the main areas of urban life, prioritizing each sector: renewable energy, pedestrianization, public and private electrification and promotion of flexible working models. For construction, the focus is on the development of fuel-efficient solutions and the use of materials that emit less CO\u2082. Enel has contributed to the development of this theme at the level of both vision and definition and business solutions.\n\nDeclaration of the Circular Cities of Latin America and the Caribbean\n\nIn October 2021, the \u201cDeclaration of Circular Cities of Latin America and the Caribbean\u201d was launched at the Italy-Latin America and Caribbean Conference, during the event organized by Enel on Circular Cities. The initiative, realized by CEPAL (Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean) and IILA (International Italo-Latin American Organization) with the aim of accelerating the development of the topic in Latin America through the definition of a common vision, clear objectives and the sharing of best practices, aims to stimulate the adhesion of cities that desire to accelerate the transition towards a circular and more sustainable urban model. At present, the Declaration has already been signed by 8 cities on the Latin American continent (including Buenos Aires, Bogot\u00e0, Mexico City, Lima, Santiago) enhancing the centrality of the circular approach in local development policies.\n\nSustainable infrastructure\n\nIn the grids sector, Enel has adopted a \u201cSustainable by design\u201d model: designing an asset with sustainable materials, minimizing emissions and consumption during construction, and favoring life extension, without excluding recovery at the end of life. The Jos\u00e9 Granda Primary Cabin in Lima, Peru, is one of the first construction sites where the \u201cSustainable by Design\u201d approach was adopted. For its implementation, several circular solutions were adopted to minimize waste and maximize material recovery: 930m\u00b3 of soil was reused and 520m\u00b3 of demolition residues recycled.\n\n\u201cEco Enel \u2013 Brasile\u201d\n\nThe Eco Enel project, launched in 2007, favors discounts on the electricity bill for customers who sort their waste and send it to specific collection and recycling points. The initiative was started in the State of Cear\u00e1 and later extended to the States of Rio de Janeiro, Goi\u00e1s and S\u00e3o Paulo. In 2015, it was included in the United Nations Development program (UNDP) report \u201cInclusive Markets in Brazil: Challenges and Opportunities of the Business Ecosystem\u201d as one of the country\u2019s 19 best practices. To date, the program has collected over 70,000 tons of waste and benefitted around 300,000 customers annually.\n\n---\n\n[2] Enel has published four papers on the topic of circular cities, helping to develop the concept and addressing issues such as strategy development, reference models and governance. Below is the link to the latest edition: https://www.enel.com/content/dam/enel-com/documenti/media/circular-cities_october2021.pdf.\nPPE recycling\n\nThe first phase of a project to provide a more circular end-of-life for the Personal Protective Equipment of our colleagues started in Italy in 2022. The material collected will be used for the manufacture of sound-absorbing panels and anti-trauma floors for use in our Operational Training Centers, but also in city playgrounds.\n\nGovernance, metrics and targets of the circular economy\n\nTo ensure the implementation of the strategy and the organic nature of the circular transition, specific units have been created in Enel to support the Group\u2019s circular economy model. In particular, these areas are present in both the different Business Lines and in the different countries and regions, under the coordination of a Holding unit, so as to ensure a coordinated approach to strategies, share knowledge and experience, and foster the integration of circular economy principles into daily choices and activities. In particular, the Business Lines are redesigning or developing business models with a circular approach, while the units at country level are providing support locally to create new business opportunities and related sustainability initiatives in collaboration with the local ecosystem. Over the past year, the circular economy has been integrated with that of sustainability initiatives in order to ensure its strong synergy social issues as well as to use the circular economy not only as a business theme but also as a model for fostering local development.\n\nIn conjunction with the launch of its Circular Economy activities in 2015, Enel placed strong emphasis on measuring circularity. In the early stages, and in the absence of international reference methodologies covering the entire value chain, the Company developed its own circularity measurement model, the CirculAbility Model. Based on the five pillars of the circular economy, this model represents the Group\u2019s vision on the subject matter, as it considers materials and energy in an integrated manner throughout all phases of the life of the asset. From this model, which represents the Group\u2019s conceptual framework, various indicators and applications have subsequently been developed in the various divisions, starting with supplier management and concluding with end customers.\n\nMeasuring the circularity of products for our customers\n\nAt Enel X, two different tools for measuring the circularity of customers have been developed to support them on a path to improvement: the Circular Economy Product Score, to measure the circularity of products in the portfolio, and the Circular Economy Report, to measure the circularity of customer products or sites at corporate level. The metrics adopted were reviewed and improved with the support of various partners such as ICMQ and CESI to develop certification schemes subject to accreditation by Accredia:\n\nCircular CertificationTM \u2013 Corporate (accredited in 2022): consists of the analysis of the qualitative level of maturity and diffusion of circular economy principles in the corporate sphere, along the entire value chain, e.g. by assessing the circularity of various elements, such as production inputs, design, procurement, corporate approach to the circular economy, etc.\n\nCircular CertificationTM \u2013 Product (under accreditation): developed by Enel X and ICMQ SpA to measure the level of product circularity. It is based on the quantification of the circularity of material and energy contributions to the manufacture of products.\n\nCircular CertificationTM \u2013 Energy Site (accredited in 2022): consists of a quantitative analysis applied to a specific customer site (such as offices, warehouse, etc.) analyzing electrical and thermal energy sources, in terms of consumption and generation, energy use efficiency, energy management practices, etc.\n\nTo maximize the spread of these certifications, in December 2021 Enel X founded the CircularEvolution association with ICMQ and CESI, with the aim of supporting the most virtuous organizations in implementing circular models.\n\n(3) The scheme refers to the International Standards ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 that describe how to apply life cycle analysis to products and services (Life Cycle Assessment or LCA).\nEnel has always been among the pioneering companies when it comes to identifying and adopting quantitative indicators at the Group level, indicators that can clearly represent the transition process towards circularity in terms of decoupling its business activities and related resource consumption. On Capital Markets Day in 2020, Enel made public for the first time a KPI related to its electricity generation activities that measures the consumption of raw materials throughout the life of power plants, in relation to the energy generated. With respect to this KPI, Enel is committed to a significant reduction in resource consumption with the goal of improving its circularity by 92% by 2030 compared to 2015.\n\nEnel - first Company in the world to launch a circularity index with the aim of doubling it by 2030\n\nWe have developed a new indicator, the \u201cEconomic CirculAbility\u00a9\u201d, which takes the Group\u2019s overall EBITDA (in euros) and compares it with the amount of resources consumed, both fuel and raw materials, throughout the value chain by the different business activities (expressed in tons). Enel presented this new KPI as part of the World Economic Forum 2023 in Davos, while committing to doubling this index by 2030 compared to 2020, thus halving the amount of resources consumed compared to EBITDA generated. Enel thus becomes the first Company in the world to adopt such a circularity indicator, and to set itself such an ambitious goal.\n\nThe ecosystem of circularity: the development of a \u201ccircular\u201d culture and new ways of collaboration\n\nAs part of our focus on the circular economy, in addition to business-related activities, we also focused on dissemination and knowledge, organizing specific webinars (5 in all) on the circular economy in 2022, each focusing on a different aspect such as the energy transition, new technologies and decarbonization, social impacts, biodiversity and communication. The sessions were attended by institutions and organizations strongly committed to the circular economy and there were over 1,500 internal and external participants.\n\nThe full development of a circular business also requires a rethinking of the ways in which it relates to the outside world, with a reassessment of the usual negotiation and contractual models and some of the individuals typical of a legal system hitherto dependent on an economically linear world. With the aim of identifying regulatory or negotiated barriers to the circularity of the Group\u2019s activities, in 2021, and in conjunction with the legal and regulatory functions, a careful analysis of regulations and contracts was undertaken to identify innovative contractual solutions and standards to support circular business models and possibly formulate regulatory proposals in different countries that could promote the development of the circular economy. The redesign of the economic model requires broad and deep change and continuous engagement with stakeholders, through the creation of an extended ecosystem (suppliers, customers, institutions, etc.) that is not limited to one\u2019s own specific sector, but progressively includes counterparts from new sectors and areas with which synergies can be developed.\n\nAlso crucial is the development and sharing of knowledge and experience through as wide a network as possible, since the circular economy is a fundamentally new topic with vast unexplored potential.\n\nTo this end, Enel is part of a number of networks to which it actively contributes, including the European Raw Material Alliance (ERMA), the European Battery Alliance, the Global Battery Alliance, the Global Alliance for Sustainable Energy, Open Power Grids, the Capital Equipment Coalition, the Alliance for the Circular Economy and the Coalici\u00f3n de Econom\u00eda Circular de Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe.\nAlliance for the Circular Economy\n\nThe Alliance for the Circular Economy is the joint initiative of 12 Italian companies who aim to promote circularity in business strategies. The Alliance was established in 2017 with the signing of the Manifesto by \u201cMade in Italy\u201d companies, leaders in various manufacturing sectors. The Alliance intends to spearhead an overall evolution of the manufacturing context in a circular perspective that enhances the peculiarities of products \u201cMade in Italy\u201d, focusing on innovation, favoring the sharing of experiences and best practices and promoting a constant comparison with the entire ecosystem of stakeholders. The companies participating in the Alliance are interpreters of a transformative economy, of an innovative way of rethinking the entire production cycle, the use of resources and business models. The following are members of the Alliance: A2A, Aquafil, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, CIRFOOD, Costa Crociere, Enel, Gruppo Hera, Intesa Sanpaolo, Gruppo Ferrovie dello Stato, Gruppo Maire Tecnimont, Salvatore Ferragamo and Touring Club. During 2022, the Alliance published two guidelines documents on circular declarations and disclosures and on circular procurement. The first document developed a vademecum for the implementation of communication policies that adhere to the principles shared by the companies in the Alliance. The document includes a common definition of circular economy and a set of key principles that companies must consider when making circular statements and disclosures. The second document includes a set of criteria and tools aimed at including circularity criteria in procurement processes, a theoretical and organizational framework for implementing circular procurement processes, and a common questionnaire for supplier engagement. The incorporation of these principles and criteria into the activities of the Alliance companies is intended to lead to a more coherent implementation of the circular economy concept in the Italian business context, and may also set an example for small and medium-sized companies that wish to adopt them.\nBelow the 2022 results related to the targets of the previous 2022-2024 Sustainability Plan, the resulting progress and the targets of the 2023-2025 Sustainability Plan, which may be redefined, added to, or surpassed with respect to the previous Plan.\n\n| SDG | Activities | 2022 results | Progress | 2023-2025 targets | Tag |\n|-----|------------|--------------|----------|-------------------|-----|\n| 12  | Reduction of specific SO\u2082 emissions(1) | -78% vs 2017 | \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf | -81% in 2025 compared to 2017 | E   |\n|     |                                                      |             |          | -85% in 2030 compared to 2017 |     |\n| 12  | Reduction of specific NO\u2093 emissions(1) | -47% vs 2017 | \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf | -47% in 2025 compared to 2017 | E   |\n|     |                                                      |             |          | -70% in 2030 compared to 2017 |     |\n| 12  | Reduction of specific dust emissions(1) | -54% vs 2017 | \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf | -54% in 2025 compared to 2017 | E   |\n|     |                                                      |             |          | -60% in 2030 compared to 2017 |     |\n| 12  | Reduction of specific freshwater withdrawal(1) | -49% vs 2017 | N.A.     | -56% in 2025 compared to 2017 | E   |\n|     |                                                      |             |          | -65% in 2030 compared to 2017 |     |\n| 12  | Reduction of specific water requirement | -47% vs 2017 | \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf | Target outdated as a new target on specific freshwater withdrawal has been defined |     |\n| 12  | Reduction of waste products(1) | -49% vs 2017 | \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf | -55% in 2030 compared to 2017 | E   |\n| 12  | Overcompliance on waste management and end-of-life | N.A. | N.A. | Promoting and disseminating good practices on waste management and end-of-life | E   |\n| 12  | \u201cZERO Plastic\u201d project - Reduction of single-use plastics at Enel Group sites | Reducing single-use plastics (office scope), compared to the new structure imposed by the pandemic, in the main countries of operation | \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf | Reduction of single-use plastics (office scope), compared to the new structure imposed by the pandemic | E   |\n|     |                                                      |             |          | Enel sites in Italy: -85% |     |\n|     |                                                      |             |          | Enel sites in Spain: -85% |     |\n|     |                                                      |             |          | Enel sites in Italy: -85% in 2025 |     |\n|     |                                                      |             |          | Enel sites in Spain: -85% in 2025 |     |\n\n(1) The values of the 2022 results, targets and 2017 baseline have been recalculated net of assets disposed as at December 31, 2022.\n(2) Compared to the volume of single-use plastics used in 2018.

Being an energy company, our operations depend on natural resources, but at the same time they have an impact on them. For this reason, we integrate risk and opportunity assessments into our decision-making processes and our Group governance, and we define specific targets for reducing impacts on nature, restoring habitats and sharing the benefits of ecosystem services with the communities with which we interact.\n\nRecent years have marked a significant increase in global awareness of the need to strengthen the commitment to not only limiting climate change, but also tackling the loss of biodiversity and defining a process for restoring it. This commitment was relaunched by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), held at COP 15 in December in Montreal, Canada. The conference resulted in the release of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, which defines strategic objectives for reducing biodiversity loss, restoring ecosystems and protecting the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities. The plan includes concrete measures to halt and reverse the loss of nature, including protecting 30% of the planet and restoring 30% of degraded ecosystems by 2030. Enel actively participated in the COP 15 business forums and supported the approval of the target to require large companies to assess and report on risks, dependencies and impacts on biodiversity.\n\nAt European level, the Commission published the Biodiversity Strategy in 2020, which involves the introduction of a series of targets that are binding on Member States; subsequently in 2022, the consultation on the proposed Nature Restoration Law was launched. The proposal aims to introduce area-based restoration measures for at least 20% of the EU\u2019s land and sea area by 2030, and all ecosystems in need of restoration by 2050, requiring Member States to formulate specific national plans. The proposal also includes specific objectives for urban ecosystems, agricultural and forest ecosystems. Enel is actively supporting the Commission\u2019s activities, promoting the synergy between the restoration of degraded areas and the development of renewable energies, as well as stimulating the participation of stakeholders. We have also proactively integrated EU principles into our Environmental and Biodiversity Policies in order to continuously improve the management of our assets and services.\n\n---\n\n1. COMM (2020) 380 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.\n2. Enel has had a Group environmental policy in place since 1996, updated in 2018 and again in 2022. The Enel Group\u2019s environmental policy covers the entire value chain, applying to: (i) all the production phases of every product and service, including distribution and logistics phases, as well as the management of related waste; (ii) each site and building; (iii) all relationships with external stakeholders; (iv) all mergers and acquisitions; (v) every key business partner (including partners related to non-managed operations, joint ventures, outsourcing or third-party producers); (vi) every supplier, including service and contractor suppliers; (vii) all due diligence and Merger & Acquisition processes.\n3. In 2015, Enel published the Group\u2019s biodiversity policy, which was updated in 2023 following the release of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.\nDuring 2022, the European Commission proceeded to adopt the action plan towards zero pollution for air, water and soil (\"Towards a Zero Pollution Ambition for air, water and soil \u2013 building a Healthier Planet for Healthy People\")\\(^{(4)}\\). The main lines of action include:\n\n- **Air quality** \u2013 In 2022, the Commission launched the proposal to revise the directives on ambient air quality, with the aim of improving alignment between EU air quality standards and the new guidelines of the WHO (World Health Organization), with particular attention to urban areas, where the majority of the population lives. Enel actively participates in the review process by promoting the adoption of zero-emission technologies that generate benefits both globally, in terms of GHG reduction, and locally, in terms of reducing atmospheric pollution.\n\n- **Industrial emissions** \u2013 As regards industrial pollution of air, water and soil, a proposal to revise the Industrial Emissions Directive was published in 2022. Enel supports the review process, in particular for large combustion plants, by committing over the years to the progressive adaptation of power plants powered by fossil fuels thanks to the introduction of technologies with low emissions of polluting substances. Furthermore, Enel actively supports the development of new technologies, such as electrification based on renewable energy, to support other sectors and uses of energy, such as the transport sector or heating and cooling in buildings.\n\n- **Soil strategy** \u2013 In November 2021, the Commission launched an EU soil strategy for 2030, which sets out measures to restore degraded soils by 2050, setting medium- and long-term objectives for 2030 and 2050 respectively. The strategy is directly linked to that of biodiversity and climate adaptation, also establishing targets relating to the restoration of degraded land, the remediation of contaminated sites and the reduction of soil use. In this context, Enel is supporting the proposed strategy, by promoting a circular approach to land management, in particular through the reuse and redevelopment of brownfield sites, as well as the repowering and lifetime extension of wind farms, in order to limit the use of soil. Also, through the Futur-e project, Enel is actively pursuing the reuse of areas within its industrial scope. Enel\u2019s Futur-e project is one of the first examples on a global scale of the redevelopment of abandoned industrial sites of different sizes and in different contexts, turning them into a development opportunity for the local area and for the Country system. Futur-e aims to adopt a circular economy approach by converting abandoned industrial sites into eco-sustainable places dedicated to science, art, culture, tourism, or new industrial activities (see the chapter \u201cOur commitment to a just transition: leaving no one behind\u201d). Enel supports this process through participation with Eurelectric on the Zero Pollution Stakeholder Platform.\n\n### Commitment to nature conservation by partnering with associations and organizations for sustainable development\n\nThe growing and renewed attention to nature and its ecosystems has led to the emergence of new coalitions and multilateral initiatives to stimulate the definition of restoration targets and the development of more ambitious policies to preserve biodiversity. Within this context, Enel is actively committed to this process, collaborating with the most relevant global stakeholders and participating in multilateral initiatives and dialogues. In particular, the main activities undertaken in 2022 included:\n\n- **partnership with Business for Nature**, launched in 2020 with the signing of the call-to-action \u201cNature is Everyone\u2019s Business\u201d, with whose business delegation Enel took part in the pre-COP 15 negotiations in Geneva, in March 2022. Furthermore, in October 2022, Enel was among the first companies to sign the Business Statement for Mandatory Assessment and Disclosure, and to support the \u201cMake it Mandatory\u201d campaign, which makes it mandatory for large companies and financial institutions to assess and report risks, dependencies and impacts on biodiversity by 2030; participation in the multistakeholder dialogue promoted by the World Business Council For Sustainable Development (WBCSD) in 2022 for the definition of the \u201cRoadmap to Nature Positive\u201d, specifically for the part relating to the energy sector, which will provide companies with a framework of action on nature, supporting them with the definition of targets, as well as with measurement and reporting activities aligned with the implementation of the Global Biodiversity Framework;\n\n- **the partnership with the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosure (TNFD)** through participation in the Forum, launched in 2021, which is working to establish,\n\n\\(^{(4)}\\) COM (2021) 400 final: Communication Pathway to a Healthy Planet for All \u2013 EU Action Plan: Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil.\nby 2023, a global framework for companies and financial institutions to assess and report on nature- and biodiversity-related risks and opportunities. Connected to this, in October 2022 Enel joined the TNFD Pilot Program led by the WBCSD, which brings together 23 companies globally to test the new framework. These companies are divided into three groups: energy, land use and built environment;\n\n- ongoing support given to the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN), a project that, on the trail of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in the area of climate, will define specific new improvement targets and objectives for nature and biodiversity conservation.\n\nEnvironmental governance and management model\n\nEnel\u2019s organizational and corporate governance model ensures that sustainability issues are appropriately taken into consideration in all relevant company decision-making processes, by defining specific tasks and responsibilities for the main corporate governance bodies.\n\nThe Board of Directors plays a central role in corporate governance as the body vested with powers related to the strategic, organizational and control policies of the Company and Group. In this context, it takes into account the need to pursue sustainable success, particularly: (i) when defining Company and Group strategies; (ii) when drawing up the remuneration policy for the Chief Executive Officer/General Manager and Key Management Personnel, defining specific sustainability objectives the achievement of which is linked to a significant component of the variable pay; and (iii) with regard to the Company\u2019s Internal Control and Risk Management System (\u201cSCIGR\u201d), aimed at the effective and efficient identification, measurement, management and monitoring of the main corporate risks, including those of an ESG nature.\n\nThe Board of Directors has also established internal board committees with the power to investigate, propose and advise, in order to ensure an adequate internal division of its functions, as well as a related parties committee. During 2022, the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee dealt with nature-related issues, reflected in the strategies and related implementation methods in 2 of the 6 meetings held, in particular during the review of: (i) the Sustainability Report for the 2021 financial year, coinciding with the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 for the same year; (ii) the materiality analysis and the guidelines of the Sustainability Plan 2023-2025, including environmental objectives; (iii) updates on the main activities carried out in 2022 by the Enel Group in the field of sustainability, on the status of implementation of the Sustainability Plan 2022-2024 and regarding Enel\u2019s inclusion in the main sustainability indices.\n\nFor more information on the activities carried out by the corporate bodies, please refer to the Enel Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structure, available at www.enel.com, governance section, as well as the chapter on \u201cClimate governance\u201d in this document.\n\nThe Board of Directors approves the Sustainability Report which also contains the Group\u2019s environmental policy.\nStrategic factors in the planning, implementation and development of Enel\u2019s operations include protecting the environment and natural resources, tackling climate change, and contributing towards sustainable economic development. These are also key factors in consolidating the Company\u2019s position as leader in the energy market. Enel has had a Group environmental policy in place since 1996, based on four fundamental principles:\n\n1. protecting the environment by preventing impacts and exploiting opportunities;\n2. improving and promoting the environmental sustainability of products and services;\n3. creating shared value for the Company and stakeholders;\n4. meeting legal compliance obligations and voluntary commitments, advancing ambitious environmental management practices\n\nand pursuing ten strategic goals:\n\n1.

Specifically:\n\n- **at Group (Holding) level** there is a central HSEQ (Health, Safety, Environment and Quality) Function with responsibility for guidance, coordination and definition of environmental policy and all other specific guidance policies. Within the HSEQ Function, the SHE.Factory has been created, which is a unit dedicated to specialized training on Safety, Health and Environment issues;\n\n- **at Business Line level**, the HSEQ Functions present in the global structure of each Business Line with a role of coordination in the management of the respective environmental issues, ensuring the necessary specialist support in keeping with the Holding\u2019s guidelines;\n\n- **at Country level**, there are staff units with a local coordination function and managers and contact persons identified in the individual operating units who manage the specific aspects of the various industrial sites. Roles and responsibilities on Health, Safety, Environment and Quality issues are defined and reported in the corporate organization charts; operating procedures and in compliance with Country legislation reflect the Company\u2019s commitment to these issues. This organization also ensures that the Integrated Health, Safety and Environment Management System complies with the requirements of the international standards ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018.\n\n**Application of ISO 14001 certified Environmental Management Systems (EMS)** is one of the strategic tools defined by the Group\u2019s environmental policy; at the end of 2022, almost all (over 99%) of operations were certified, while for new plants and new installations, the preparatory activities for certification are progressively planned. Given the complexity and variety of activities carried out in the Group, an ISO 14001:2015 certified modular approach has been adopted, with the definition of a management system at Holding level, which provides guidance and coordination to the Business Lines on environmental issues. Each Business Line has launched its own EMS focused on its own specific activities. Furthermore, the main thermal and geothermal production sites in Europe now also have EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) registration.\n\nIn support of activities for monitoring environmental performance and the definition of improved plans for the operating units of the Business Lines, the Group environmental reporting system Enel Data on Environment (EDEN) is used. During 2022, further improvements were made to version 2.0 of the EDEN tool, in order to make the data validation system and the calculation and reporting of environmental KPIs even more robust. Enel also has the global digital dashboards She.metrics and She.start for monitoring environmental accidents and improvement actions, which are defined during assessments or Extra Checking on Site (see the paragraph \u201cOperational analysis and monitoring tools\u201d).\n\n**Training and internal communication**\n\nTraining is one of the strategic objectives of the Group\u2019s policy and forms an integral part of the EMS. Approximately **41 thousand hours of training** were provided in 2022, including 13 thousand hours directly through SHE.Factory. In 2022, implementation of the environmental training program continued, targeted at increasing the skills of the Group\u2019s technical staff and people with operational responsibilities (Environmental Competence Building Program), particularly in the field of water management and climate change. Training sessions were also held to update staff on Group policies and on the environmental data management platforms (EDEN), with a view to aligning the adoption criteria in all Countries. Various communication initiatives were promoted through internal web channels in order to disseminate and strengthen Enel\u2019s commitment to preserving biodiversity and nature, by disseminating best practices and active restoration projects in the various Countries where the Group is present, and specific campaigns were launched to raise the awareness of internal personnel (see the \u201cNear Miss\u201d box). Enel has also established partnerships with local environmental associations to raise awareness among young people in the areas where it operates.\nTraining in schools\n\nIn 2022, on World Biodiversity Day, Enel launched two innovative training projects in conjunction with Legambiente and Beeing and targeted at primary and secondary school students, to raise awareness of the Company\u2019s high level of commitment to defending biodiversity and supporting the energy transition. **Biodiversity4Young** reached more than 250 students in 7 regions throughout Italy in 2022, thanks to the presence of experts from Legambiente and local Enel colleagues, who illustrated our initiatives with the passion of those who are part of the local community in the host territory. **Bee4education** took place in the Training and Education Center in L\u2019Aquila, in partnership with the startup Beeing; this project consists of providing a very inspiring experience on energy and biodiversity with the possibility of getting up close to bees, thanks also to an innovative hive with a transparent side that enables the bees to be observed while they work. The training program, which was carried out from May to October 2022 and was targeted at primary and lower secondary schools in the province of L\u2019Aquila, involved 300 students and 34 teachers at 4 local schools.\n\nHSE Near Miss Campaign\n\nIn 2022, an innovative internal communication campaign on HSE Near Misses was launched in all Countries, with the aim of informing Enel X Global Retail people about the meaning of near misses and the importance of reporting them and raising awareness among contractors. Some cartoon examples were shared, which depicted near misses that have actually occurred within the Business Line.\nIdentification of impact factors and dependencies on nature and biodiversity\n\nThe identification of potential impact factors on nature and biodiversity is fundamental for Enel in order to define the most effective strategies to avoid, minimize, remedy or compensate for the associated effects, in line with the provisions of the Mitigation Hierarchy included in the Group\u2019s environmental policy. Similarly, the identification of dependencies on natural capital and biodiversity enables us to identify the most appropriate strategies to reduce the risks to the Company that may derive from these dependencies.\n\nThe activity referred primarily to direct activities that are not yet inclusive of the entire value chain, and involved all of the Group\u2019s main technologies, from electricity generation from renewable sources and combined-cycle gas turbine power plants, to electricity distribution systems. The following were not considered in the analysis: coal-fired thermoelectric generation, which is already the subject of a medium-term phase-out program, in line with the decarbonization strategy adopted by the Group, and infrastructure linked to energy services, such as charging stations for electric cars, as they operate in generally urbanized habitats.\n\nImpact factors\n\nThe main impact factors (or pressures) that may be exerted on nature are summarized in the following categories, inspired by those identified by the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN), and which have been adopted as the starting point for analyzing actions implemented to mitigate the associated risks:\n\n1. use and modification of ecosystems (terrestrial, fresh water, marine);\n2. use of resources (mainly water withdrawal);\n3. climate change (GHG emissions);\n4. pollution (emissions, discharge, waste);\n5. disturbances (noise, vibration, artificial lighting) and introduction of invasive species.\n\nThe table shows the results of the preliminary materiality analysis of impact factors conducted at Group level for the various technologies. In this case, the evaluation approach indicated by the SBTN and the TNFD proposal was used, and the ENCORE tool was used. The scores were internally reviewed based on the specific construction and operating solutions adopted by the Group.\n\n| Impact factors by technology | Hydroelectric | Solar PV | Wind | CCGT | Networks |\n|-----------------------------|---------------|---------|------|------|----------|\n| 1.1 Use of terrestrial ecosystems | VM | M | M | M | M |\n| 1.2 Use of fresh water ecosystems | VM | NM | | | |\n| 2.

Also in this case, the evaluation criteria indicated by the SBTN and by the TNFD proposal and the guidelines provided by the ENCORE tool were used. The scores were reviewed internally based on the construction and operating solutions adopted by Enel.\n\n(6) Networks were given a conventional weighting of 25%, being the average of the values associated with the various generation technologies, also by virtue of its transversal function with respect to them.\n### Dependencies by technology\n\n| Dependencies by technology | Hydroelectric | Solar PV | Wind | CCGT | Networks |\n|---------------------------|---------------|---------|------|------|----------|\n| 1.

Regarding these results, Enel\u2019s decarbonization strategy, which is focused on the phase-out of fossil fuels and the growth of renewables, particularly wind and solar technologies, reduces impact on the climate by helping to reduce pressure on the ecosystem services on which we depend, such as water resources.\n\n---\n\n[7] The Networks were given a conventional weighting of 25%, being the average of the values associated with the various generation technologies, also by virtue of its transversal function with respect to them.\nAnalysis of environmental risks and opportunities\n\nThe analysis of environmental risks and opportunities associated with Enel\u2019s business activities was conducted with a multifunctional integrated approach in line with the guidelines set out in the guidelines of the TNFD proposal and of the SBTN. The analysis, conducted in 2022 based on the results of the materiality analysis for impacts and dependencies described above, led to the identification for each technology of the main operational and economic-financial risks expected for the Company, as well as social and environmental risks, and the identification of the biggest opportunities in relation to each relevant impact factor and dependency. This preliminary screening analysis led to the definition of an evaluation template for each technology, which was used to identify the main critical events of a physical type (both acute in the short-medium term and chronic in the long term) and of a transitional type (resulting from possible changes in the regulatory, technological, reputational or market framework), and the main associated risks and opportunities expected. The main operational and material economic-financial risks for Enel are shown below:\n\n- reduction or interruption of generation capacity;\n- recovery and repair needs;\n- authorization delays;\n- adaptation and technological innovation needs;\n- additional insurance fees;\n- loss of competitiveness.\n\nSimultaneously, this screening phase selected the following main opportunities:\n\n- improvement of environmental and sustainability performance, such as efficiency in the use of resources and initiatives for the protection, restoration and regeneration of natural habitats;\n- business opportunities, linked for example to the offer of nature-positive energy products and services, the launch of new partnerships in sustainable innovation sectors, access to green financing, and strategic choices of commitment and sector leadership, aimed at the economic, reputational and financial growth of the Company.\n\nThe screening analysis on Group impacts/risks conducted in 2022 reaffirmed the action priorities identified last year and described in the following table.\n\n| Impact Factors (or Pressures) | Importance | Level of control | Priorities |\n|------------------------------|------------|-----------------|------------|\n| Use of terrestrial ecosystems | \u2022 Land use | \u2022 Magnitude | \u2022 Goals |\n|                              | \u2022 Habitat transformation and fragmentation | High | \u2022 Mitigation plans |\n|                              | High | Moderate | High |\n| Use of natural resources     | \u2022 Water withdrawal | High | High | Moderate |\n| Climate change               | \u2022 Climate-changing gas emissions | Very high | Very high | Moderate |\n| Pollution                    | \u2022 Pollutant emissions (non-GHG) | High | High | Moderate |\n|                              | \u2022 Water and soil pollution | High | High | Moderate |\n|                              | \u2022 Waste production | High | High | Moderate |\n| Disturbance factors and other| \u2022 Noise and other | Low | Moderate | Low |\n|                              | \u2022 Invasive species | Low | Moderate | Low |\n\nThe identified intervention priorities relate to the control of risk associated with land occupation and the transformation of ecosystems, and particularly to the use of land and the transformation of terrestrial habitats, in relation to which new commitments were made at Group level as early as last year (see the paragraph \u201cEnel\u2019s commitment to biodiversity\u201d). The analysis also highlighted an already very high level of commitment and control for risks associated with the use of natural resources (water withdrawal) and with potential pollution factors of environmental matrices (emissions, discharges and waste production), as well as with climate change. In fact, for years Enel has already been defining stringent improvement targets, the results of which are described in the following paragraphs, which make it possible to mitigate the main risks associated with these impact factors in the future.\n\nFollowing the screening activity described above, a more detailed aggregate analysis (by technology) was launched and is currently under way, which takes into account the estimated magnitude of potential risks or possible oppor-\ntunities, the relative probability of occurrence and the mitigation actions already adopted by the Company. At the conclusion of this phase, the risk/opportunity analysis will therefore also be extended to the project and site level, to take into account the specific local context and the interaction of each technological asset with the local characteristics of nature and biodiversity. In this further phase, particular importance and priority will be given to plants in operation and to new assets in the planning and authorization phase which are located in areas of high value or naturalistic vulnerability, such as protected areas, critical habitats and water risk areas.\n\n**Dependency management**\n\nMeanwhile, as regards the management of dependencies, the main criticality of which is linked to the effects of climate change (climate regulation), an analysis was conducted for each technology and for each geographical area in which the Group is present. The operational and economic-financial risks resulting from the occurrence of acute and chronic meteorological phenomena were also analyzed in order to define specific adaptation and resilience plans. Acute and chronic physical phenomena are intensified and accelerated by ongoing climate change and their effects on the integrity, operational continuity and correct functioning of our plants depend, to an essential extent, on the ecosystem services of mitigation and control performed by the surrounding natural environment, which may be potentially compromised by human impacts (such as the sealing of occupied soil or the extraction of raw materials). Among these ecosystem services, regulation of the water cycle and the ability of vegetation to protect, prevent and mitigate the onset and intensity of flooding or soil subsidence phenomena are particularly relevant, as is the action of extreme winds. For more details, see the paragraph \u201cEnel\u2019s impact on climate change \u2013 Climate scenarios, strategy and risks\u201d in the chapter \u201cZero emissions ambition\u201d.\n\n**Operational analysis and monitoring tools**\n\nFrom an operational point of view, in order to identify and minimize environmental risks related to our activities, Enel has equipped itself at Group level with a series of important tools for guidance, investigation and intervention with respect to both the environment and the socio-economic context. These tools are referred to below and can operate in a capillary and synergistic way within the organization to protect the environment and associated ecosystems.\n\n**Group Policy for the classification and analysis of environmental accidents.** Environmental accidents are classified according to their type and relevance. This classification is based on their possible impact on the environmental matrices and on any potentially sensitive areas (ecosystems and protected areas), in addition to their negative impact on the organization itself (operational, legal, reputational and financial). In accordance with their classification and magnitude of such accidents, the policy defines communication procedures, the creation of analysis groups with the participation of the Global Functions, cause analysis, and monitoring of subsequent corrective actions and improvements.\n\n**Policy for assessing risks and opportunities related to environmental impacts.** The policy applies to all operational sites (including those being decommissioned) and to Group staff functions in which an EMS compliant with ISO 14001:2015 requirements is adopted. Its application involves the adoption of a single model for the classification and assessment of risks and opportunities linked to impact factors (or pressures) exerted on the environment, through the use of an IT tool called ERA (Environmental Risk Analysis). The analysis process involves evaluating both the interactions of significant operational aspects with various environmental matrices, and mitigation controls adopted for compliance with regulatory compliance, as well as the most stringent voluntary continuous improvement targets; furthermore, taking into account the results of the analysis of any accidental environmental events and periodic environmental visits to the various sites (Extra Checking on Site \u2013 ECoS), it allows a high level of integration of continuous control processes between the various levels of the organization and the related prioritization of improvement actions. Finally, the analysis enables the assessment of environmental aspects linked to governance and strategic activities carried out by the central Functions of the organization.\n\n**Extra Checking on Site (ECoS) Policy.** The ECoS is a tool for planning and conducting site visits by cross-divisional teams of experts in support of plants and operational facilities and with a view to identifying improvement plans and sharing best practices. In 2022, the different Business Lines across all the Countries in which the Group operates conducted over 80 ECoS with a focus on the environment. See also the chapter \u201cOccupational health and safety\u201d.\n\n**Environmental qualifications and inspections for suppliers of products and services.** In consideration of the importance and role that suppliers have in determining the overall environmental performances of the Company, Enel has adopted a supplier environmental assessment procedure that is structured and homogeneous for the entire Group, activated in the development phase, above all for high environmental risk activities, and following important environmental events. Environmental assessments aim to verify the EMS of suppliers.\nas a whole and propose improvement actions to be shared with the supplier. They are also accompanied by environmental inspections conducted at the suppliers\u2019 operating sites, which include assessments on specific aspects of biodiversity. In order to standardize inspection standards and obtain a structured and widespread control system, Enel has adopted Group Guidelines on Environmental Inspections, which define the planning criteria as well as methods of execution in the field (see the chapter \u201cSustainable supply chain\u201d).\n\nConsequence Management Procedure. At Group level, Enel has adopted an organizational procedure that defines a global line of action to improve the environmental performance of its suppliers; specifically, roles and responsibilities are defined in order to implement Consequence Management, as well as actions against its contractors, in the event of their involvement in significant environmental events and/or due to low performance on specific environmental issues, encountered during the performance of the contract.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that in analyzing the local context, which forms the basis for the community relations model, an assessment of the main social and environmental risks and opportunities is carried out in order to minimize them and promote socio-economic development. See the chapter on \u201cEngaging communities\u201d.\n\nPreserving biodiversity\n\nEnel\u2019s commitment to biodiversity\n\nProtection of biodiversity is one of the strategic objectives of Enel\u2019s environmental policy and is regulated by a specific policy adopted by Enel in 2015 and renewed in 2023 following COP 15. The policy defines the guidelines for all the Group\u2019s biodiversity protection initiatives and the principles according to which they operate, aligned with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.\n\nEnel has renewed its commitment to biodiversity, published in the 2022 Sustainability Report, by committing itself to concrete actions and time targets.\n\nBiodiversity Policy\n\nEnel\u2019s roadmap on biodiversity conservation is in line with the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework, embracing the mission of taking action to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030.\n\nIn particular, our Company is committed to:\n\n* applying the mitigation hierarchy principle in all project phases, avoiding and reducing impacts on high biodiversity areas and ecosystem functions and services, reducing deforestation and habitat transformation; where avoidance is not possible, we strive to minimize adverse impacts, implement rehabilitation and restoration measures and finally, compensating for residual impacts;\n* implementing, in the case of biodiversity significant residual impacts for new development projects, compensatory works according to the commitment of \u201cNo Net Loss\u201d of biodiversity and \u201cNo Net Deforestation\u201d, and where applicable to have a Net Positive balance;\n* assessing and transparently disclosing impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities on biodiversity along operations, supply and value chains, setting goals and targets on priority issues;\n* promoting biodiversity and nature-based solutions integration into business solutions for customers and urban ecosystem, boosting related environmental and social positive impacts;\n* collaborating with public administrations, research centers, environmental and social associations and international stakeholders, as partners in the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of resources, fostering new innovative and systemic approaches and synergies while respecting the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities;\n* monitoring and reporting progress towards the achievement of local and global goals and targets in alignment to main international standards and in a transparent and responsible approach, for accounting performances on biodiversity and natural capital management;\n* promoting environmental awareness towards workers and stakeholders, to valorize biodiversity conservation and responsible use of natural resources.\nOur commitment to nature\n\nEnel undertakes to achieve **No Net Loss of biodiversity** for new infrastructures from 2030, commencing its adoption on selected projects in areas of high biodiversity importance beginning 2025. To achieve this goal, Enel will work in accordance with the principles of the Mitigation Hierarchy to avoid, minimize and recover impacts on natural habitats or species that are threatened, endemic or restricted in range.\n\nIn addition, Enel is committed to conserving forests and, if deforestation cannot be avoided, will reforest areas of equivalent value in line with the principle of **\u201cNo Net Deforestation\u201d**.\n\nEnel will not build new infrastructures in areas designated as UNESCO World Heritage Natural Sites. Enel integrates the assessment of risks and opportunities linked to nature into corporate activities in order to align risk management strategy and processes; it also undertakes to evaluate 100% of the significant assets in operation by 2025 in order to update, where necessary, the associated action plan.\n\n---\n\n(8) For Enel Grids, the assessment focuses on significant assets in protected areas.\nWith technical and specialist support from The Biodiversity Consultancy, Enel has developed a methodology for site-specific adoption of the \u201cNo Net Loss\u201d (NNL) principle on biodiversity, developed in a functional manner and integrated into business processes and in line with International Finance Corporation Performance Standard 6 on conserving biodiversity and living natural resources, in order to define any mitigation actions necessary for individual projects.\n\nNo Net Loss: from analysis to implementation\n\nThe methodology involves applying an impact mitigation hierarchy starting from a preliminary analysis of natural habitats, including forests, and priority species, by means of a desk analysis that involves the use of application tools such as GIS Portal (Geographic Information System)\u2014for the correlation of georeferenced information relating to assets with global maps on habitats (IUCN Habitat Type Classification) and on species (IUCN Red List of Threatened Species)\u2014and IBAT (Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool), which is specifically for biodiversity. In addition to the desk analysis, site surveys are carried out starting from the localization of the new infrastructure, and continuing up to the execution and monitoring phases. In order to mitigate and compensate for any residual impacts on natural habitats\u2014including forests\u2014and species, specific action plans (BAP \u2013 Biodiversity Action Plan) are defined and broken down into monitoring, conservation and compensation projects, responding to NNL\u2019s commitment to biodiversity. Enel tested the methodology by developing a number of pilot cases, starting with environmental impact assessments and the related mitigation actions already identified; it emerged that in some cases, the actions identified already guarantee achievement of the NNL, whereas for others, additional offsetting actions are required. By way of example, the results on some of the sites analyzed are shown below.\n\nCarbo Project \u2013 The project is a study for the construction of a photovoltaic system over a site spanning 96 hectares in Spain (Andalusia), which is situated in natural habitats characterized by the presence of oaks and shrubs, and in habitats modified by the presence of crops. The species analysis did not highlight any species at risk of extinction (IUCN Red List of Threatened Species). During the impact assessment phase, many actions were defined for the conservation of local biodiversity, such as planting oak trees and green corridors along the perimeter of the plant, as well as protection and conservation interventions for some characteristic species (for example, installation of water stations, construction of protective covers using piles of stones, restoration of old buildings close to the plant used by various species as potential nesting sites) in order to promote the reproductive capacity of the species. The defined compensation plan satisfies the NNL criterion and no additional offsetting actions are required.\n\nBarzalosa Project \u2013 Additional case to apply the methodology, concerning the design, in the Municipality of Girardot (Cundinamarca), Colombia, of a new primary substation (0.89 ha surface area) and related high voltage line (0.8 km) and medium-voltage line (47.5 km). From the impact assessment, important actions were defined to protect biodiversity, minimize impacts, and carry out reforestation, despite the area being situated within a partially urbanized habitat. Right from the screening phase, Enel identified the type of habitat with the aid of application tools and the use of detailed global satellite maps; desk analysis were also conducted on the animal species in the area, also supported by the results of monitoring campaigns carried out in situ. Although the application of the NNL methodology estimated a negligible net loss of biodiversity, Enel nonetheless committed to the restoration, conservation and enhancement of habitat by planting of over 200 native trees.\nMeasures taken to reduce impacts\n\nEnel has consolidated experience in managing and protecting biodiversity near its production sites, starting from the site design and construction phases; particularly in the past few years, activity has focused on renewable plants and distribution networks, in line with the Group\u2019s decarbonization strategy. The Group Guidelines, issued in 2019, define the principles and procedures for managing impacts on biodiversity during the entire life cycle of plants, from the development phase to operation and decommissioning, through the application of the Mitigation Hierarchy in the various phases of the life cycle.\n\nFor the Group\u2019s plants and installations that have been present in the local area for a long time, environmental protection and monitoring action plans are also adopted. In line with international standards and the principles of the biodiversity policy, the risk to biodiversity is assessed in an integrated manner right from the feasibility phase, starting with the location of the site of interest, and involves an assessment of the type of habitat, prioritizing habitats that do not present environmental criticalities, and considering geographical proximity to protected areas, habitats that are critical or important for biodiversity, as well as the potential presence of endangered species in the area of interest. To support the definition of local action plans for the mitigation of any risk identified, Enel adopts a consolidated process of stakeholder engagement, which involves continuous dialogue in synergy with all stakeholders\u2014local communities, competent authorities and research institutes\u2014with a view to supporting increasingly sustainable business for the economy, nature and people.\n\nIn the construction of new plants, specific action plans are also adopted to protect biodiversity by checking the effectiveness of the actions undertaken and the occurrence of any potential impacts, including at a later stage after the works have started. In the case of large plants, impact mitigation plans are envisaged, developed together with local stakeholders, including reforestation (see box \u201cRestoration of the El Quimbo tropical forest\u201d).\n\nOnce the infrastructure is commissioned, protection of biodiversity becomes an integral part of environmental management, through periodical management for the checking of impacts highlighted in the authorization phase, as well as the continuous assessment of potential impacts that could occur later. This is also the moment where the plant consolidates its relationship with the local area and where initiatives are developed, such as voluntary projects to safeguard local species and improve habitat conditions, based on knowledge of the environment surrounding the site. The results of monitoring at the local level are communicated and analyzed at global level by means of internal tools, allowing the identification of general issues that need to be addressed with improvement plans or projects at Group level. The main impacts on biodiversity during operations linked to technologies are:\n\n- **wind plants**: impacts related to collision with birds and bats. Among the global initiatives aimed at reducing interference with birds and bats, the Wind Wildlife Challenge project (2022) was launched, which involves identifying increasingly innovative solutions such as the use of sensors and tools, based on radar, chamber and multi-sensor technologies, that can detect and even actuate the automatic shutdown of the turbine concerned; tests are under way on plants in Italy, Spain, Chile, the United States and Canada. This testing campaign follows the one already launched in 2021 in the South African plant of Gibson Bay with ultrasonic deterrent systems specifically for bats;\n\n- **hydroelectric plants**: interference with fish and soil erosion; respectively, fish restocking actions are envisaged to restore the ecosystem and species, such as the restoration or improvement of spawning or fry habitats, the planting of native species directly or near the banks of the reservoir in order to control the stability of the terrain, and also to improve habitat conditions;\n\n- **solar plants**: related to the occupation and possible transformation of habitats. The main initiatives include agrivoltaics, where the spaces between rows of photovoltaic modules are used to plant aromatic and medicinal herbs, food plants and melliferous flowers to also encourage the establishment of pollinator species, which improve the biodiversity of the site\u2019s ecosystems and ecosystem services;\n\n- **distribution networks**: risk of birds colliding with overhead lines being electrocuted; for this reason, starting from the design phase to the operation and maintenance of existing sites, according to the biodiversity aspects associated with the site, Enel adopts mitigation measures, including the installation of line marking devices at regular intervals along overhead power lines, as well as the isolation of live parts. Added to this are actions related to the mitigation of interference risks during the construction phase, including the relocation of terrestrial fauna to protected areas.\nReforestation\nS\u00e3o Luiz Gonzaga\n(Rio Grande do Sul)\n\nMaintenance activities on existing networks require deforestation interventions to guarantee the correct and safe functioning of power lines and substations. In order to mitigate the impact of maintenance carried out on operational networks, Enel defines and adopts recovery plans for impacted habitats, through systematic planting of native species.\n\nThe main initiatives notably include an activity launched in 2017 in the Municipality of S\u00e3o Luiz Gonzaga (Brazil), which was completed and tested as recently as the end of 2022, linked to the license for maintaining the distribution network in the area. It is a reforestation activity using plants for phytodepuration as well as melliferous species, which are used to attract pollinating insects, created at a former landfill. Local communities have also been involved in monitoring herbaceous and shrubby flora grown in the area. Furthermore, some bird species have also been considered, for which a census was carried out based on the sighting and discovery of nesting sites.\n\nRestoration of the\nEl Quimbo tropical forest\n(Colombia)\n\nNear the El Quimbo hydroelectric plant in Colombia, an important reforestation project focusing on tropical dry forest was started in 2014 and is still ongoing, which will affect a total area of over 11,000 hectares in the various stages of the project. In the initial phase, launched on an area of 140 hectares with the support of Fundaci\u00f3n Natura, the best strategies to be implemented in the restoration process were defined and the optimal native species for restoration and propagation were identified; the pilot phase also led to the discovery of a new species of bromeliad *Pitcairnia huilensis*. In 2022, the area covered by the restoration projects totaled approximately 7.3 thousand hectares, including approximately 6.6 thousand hectares of assisted natural regeneration and approximately 0.7 thousand hectares of active restoration. In addition, the \u201cAttalea\u201d Tropical Dry Forest Research Center was created, which works in collaboration with Colombian universities on numerous ecological restoration initiatives, collaborations and projects in support of biodiversity research. Demonstrating the importance of the area from an ecological perspective, around one thousand hectares of the area being restored have already been declared a Civil Society Nature Reserve, while the possibility of extending the protected area to include a further 3 thousand hectares is being evaluated.\n\nOpportunities for development and shared wellbeing\n\nFor us, interacting with the local area and communities is an opportunity to promote socio-economic development, generating value and wellbeing through our services and products, in all the contexts in which we operate. In particular, as far as cities are concerned, the ongoing growing trend of urbanization can generate significant conflicts between natural and urban environments. To meet this need, Enel recognizes the importance of adopting nature-based solutions (NBS) as a powerful tool for sustainable city planning and innovative design for customers who address these issues. Enel X Global Retail proposes NBS solutions that can be integrated into the offer portfolio, and which have been associated with internationally recognized scientific indicators that are used to measure the positive impacts on urban biodiversity. In practice, the NBS solutions can be integrated with technological solutions and are aimed at providing ecosystem services, from climate change adaptation and mitigation to improving the quality of life in urban centers.\nNature in the city\n\nOne of the various global initiatives for integrating NBS with Enel X solutions is an intervention carried out in Santiago, Chile, involving the rooftop refurbishment of the Mandarin Hotel; along with the installation of a new photovoltaic system, a biodiversity intervention was carried out involving the construction of a greenhouse, the planting of local fruit trees and the installation of a number of beehives to protect pollinating species and develop urban beekeeping.\n\nA further environmental redevelopment intervention was carried out in the city of Bogot\u00e1 (Colombia), near the e-bus terminal, by Enel X Global Retail. The intervention involved planting urban vegetable gardens and vertical greenery, which was integrated with a number of murals. The initiative also directly engaged the local community in choosing artistic content and enhancing the urban garden.\n\nThe strategy linked to urban biodiversity is associated with further opportunities linked to power generation, such as the creation of agrivoltaic plants, which integrate business needs with nature. In recent years, many pilot solar plants have been built, where planting of native and pollinating species has been carried out, to support the entire ecological balance, as well as promoting sustainable crops, in synergy with local communities.\n\nThe biodiversity action plan\n\nIn 2022, 200 projects were carried out to protect species and natural habitats at operating plants, of which 82 were developed in partnership with government agencies and non-governmental organizations and universities, for a total investment of around 11.9 million euros. The projects were carried out in all countries and regions and mainly concern operational renewable generation plants and distribution networks. The projects included habitat recovery activities covering 9,452 ha (9,092 ha in 2021), most of which are related to ecological restoration and reforestation, mainly in Colombia, Brazil, Chile and Spain. Examples of the measures to mitigate impacts on biodiversity carried out to apply the related policy are available on the sustainability section of the www.enel.com website, at the following link: https://www.enel.com/investors/sustainability/strategy-sustainable-progress/biodiversity.\n\nIn addition, in 2022 a further 63 projects relating to plant construction sites were carried out, mainly in Brazil, Chile, Spain and North America, targeted at the conservation and monitoring of native species impacted, for an overall capital expenditure of 6.4 million euros.\nInteraction of assets with biodiversity and protected areas\n\nEnel measures its environmental performance on aspects of biodiversity in a transparent and responsible way, both in the construction of new plants and during the operation of its power generation sites. For this reason, in 2021 we defined and calculated a set of specific indicators, which are updated annually, to measure the impacts generated and monitor the effectiveness of action plans.\n\n**Land occupation**: the area of land occupied by assets. This is a general indicator, as it does not provide an indication of the quality of the habitat that has been occupied by the assets.\n\n### Land occupation\\(^{(9)}\\) \u2013 Power generation assets\n\n| Technology       | Hectares (ha) in 2021\\(^{(10)}\\) | Hectares (ha) in 2022 |\n|------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Solar            | 16,632                          | 27,773                |\n| Wind             | 12,660                          | 13,326                |\n| Hydroelectric    | 202,425                         | 202,425               |\n| Geothermal       | 442                             | 442                   |\n| Thermal          | 6,318                           | 6,318                 |\n\nIn 2022, the land occupation of power generation assets increased by **11,807 ha**, equal to +5%\\(^{(10)}\\) of the total (238,477 ha in 2021), including 4.7% solar and 0.3% wind, in line with the development of new plants envisaged by the business strategy.\n\n### Land occupation \u2013 Asset Grids\\(^{(11)}\\)\n\nThis year, data on the occupation of distribution infrastructures is also reported for the first time, calculated by evaluating the buffer zone for high-voltage (HV) and medium-voltage (MV) lines as land occupation, distinguished by voltage level and type of conductor (bare or in cable) and the surface area of transformer substations.\n\n| Technology                        | Hectares (ha)\\(^{(12)}\\) | km       |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|----------|\n| Primary and secondary substations | 2,539                    | -        |\n| High Voltage Lines                | 54,296                   | 33,716   |\n| Medium Voltage Lines              | 431,307                  | 653,205  |\n| Total                             | **488,142**              | **686,921** |\n\n### Transformation of natural habitats\n\nmeasures the area of land occupied in hectares (ha), classified according to the IUCN\\(^{(13)}\\) habitat categories on which the assets have been built. It therefore represents a specific indicator of the impact on habitats that have been transformed to build plants. Power generation plants that entered operation in 2022 occupy land amounting to **11,807 ha**, an increase of 10% on the growth recorded in 2021 (10,700 ha), due to an increase in the development of renewable energies; of this new land occupation, **5,770 ha** (49%) relate to natural habitats (23% less than the previous year, 7,530 ha), and, of these, **537 ha** (5%) are related to forest-type habitats.\n\nAs far as distribution is concerned, almost all HV and MV lines were built in the 1970s, mainly in urbanized habitats.\n\n### Presence of assets in protected areas\n\nmapping was carried out for all power generation assets and from this year also for Grids HV and MV lines, in the main Countries,\\(^{(14)}\\) to assess the presence of assets in UNESCO World Heritage Natural areas and IUCN I\u2013IV classified protected areas.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{(9)}\\) Land occupation was calculated for power generation facilities using a GIS application in which each plant was modeled and georeferenced. The following criteria were used to model land occupation and area of influence: solar, thermoelectric and geothermal were modeled with the plant perimeter; for hydroelectric, the perimeter of the reservoirs was modeled; for wind plants, from the position of the generators the area of land occupation is modeled in a precautionary manner to take into account ancillary works such as yards, roads and areas used when the construction site is operative (in so far as they are subsequently restored).\n\n\\(^{(10)}\\) Compared with last year, KPI mapping and calculation tools were refined, which led to a slight change in the figure compared to 2021.\n\n\\(^{(11)}\\) Land occupation intended as a buffer zone for HV and MV lines and the area occupied by primary and secondary substations was calculated using the PUC (Single Cartographic Portal).\n\n\\(^{(12)}\\) https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/habitat-classificationscheme.\n\n\\(^{(13)}\\) Italy, Spain, Chile MT, Peru, Colombia and Brazil (Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro).\n\n\\(^{(14)}\\) Italy, Spain, Chile MT, Peru, Colombia and Brazil (Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro).\n### Presence of power generation plants in protected areas as at 2022 \u2013 by technology\n\n| Technology                  | number of infrastructures in protected areas/total number | Countries                  | Presence in protected areas (ha) | Presence in protected areas as % of the total occupied by technology |\n|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Solar                       | 4/161                                                    | Greece                     | 32                               | 0.1%                                                                |\n| Wind                        | 8/266                                                    | Italy/Spain                | 116                              | 0.9%                                                                |\n| Hydroelectric reservoirs    | 135/1,096(15)                                           | Italy/Spain/Chile          | 5,595                            | 2.8%                                                                |\n| Geothermal plants           | 0/39                                                     | -                          | -                                | -                                                                   |\n| Thermoelectric plants       | 2/9(17)                                                  | Italy                      | 28                               | 0.4%                                                                |\n\n### Presence of power plants in protected areas \u2013 by Country\n\n| Countries | Hectares (ha) | % in protected area of the total area occupied in the Country |\n|-----------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Italy     | 3,738         | 19%                                                           |\n| Spain     | 1,986         | 8%                                                            |\n| Greece    | 32            | 6%                                                            |\n| Chile     | 15            | 0.03%                                                         |\n| Total     | 5,771         | 2.3%                                                          |\n\nThe number of generating plants situated within protected areas (IUCN I-IV) remains unchanged since 2013, as no new plants have been built in these areas. The presence of power generation assets in protected areas mainly refers to hydroelectric plants which were largely built before the 1970s (in many cases before the creation of protected areas) and which are managed according to basin management plans shared with the authorities and which promote the conservation of local species. Notable examples are the multi-year ENDESA-bats project, developed voluntarily in the autonomous Spanish provinces of Catalonia, Galicia, Andalusia and Aragon through the study and monitoring of the bat populations that inhabit the tunnels of hydroelectric plants and infrastructures. This project aims to improve the knowledge and conservation of cave bats, their ecological needs and their relationship with the operation of hydroelectric plants, through study and monitoring campaigns, using new cutting-edge methods and technologies such as automatic monitoring by means of time-lapse photography (photo-trapping) and ultrasound recordings. Through the collation of data, Enel carries out various actions to adapt its plumbing systems so that they promote bat colonies, including the air conditioning of tunnel entrances, the targeted positioning of shelter boxes and a reduction in brightness at a number of points that are critical to the bats.\n\n### Presence of distribution infrastructure in protected areas as at 2022 \u2013 by technology\n\n| Technology                  | Hectares in protected areas (ha) | % in protected areas of the total occupied by the asset(18) |\n|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Primary and secondary substations | 28                              | 1.1%                                                        |\n| High and medium voltage lines | 13,769                           | 2.8%                                                        |\n| Total                       | 13,797                           | 2.8%                                                        |\n\nThe countries in the Enel Grids perimeter with the highest proportion of assets present in protected areas are Spain, Italy and Brazil. Most of the Enel Grids infrastructure was built before the 1970s, in many cases before the creation of protected areas. In cases where the infrastructure falls within a protected area, Enel creates the best solutions to mitigate impact on the surrounding environment, also considering the need to comply with its service obligation. Below are some examples of mitigation projects currently under way for infrastructure that falls within protected areas (IUCN I-IV).\n\n---\n\n(15) The data reported on GIS has been revised and optimized, leading to adjustments in the value of hectares (ha) and the number of plants compared with last year.\n(16) The figure represents individual reservoirs, not hydroelectric power generation plants.\n(17) The figure includes plants being decommissioned.\n(18) Out of the total of HV and MV lines.\n| Technology                  | Country     | Plant                  | Land occupation (ha) in protected areas | Critical species impacted                                      | Habitat | Biodiversity projects                                                                 |\n|-----------------------------|-------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Refurbishment of existing HV line | Colombia    | New Hope - Indumil     | 3                                        | Bromeliaceae (Tillandsia spp.), Orchidaceae (Epidendrum secundum) | Forest  | Rescue, translocation and safeguarding of 56 specimens of epiphytic plants (orchids and bromeliads) |\n| Refurbishment of existing HV line | Colombia    | Zipaquir\u00e1 - Ubat\u00e9      | 22                                       | Native and non-native plants belonging to different forest species (Juglans, Quercus, Fuchsia, Trichanthera spp.) | Forest  | Planting to offset trees removal and vegetation clearance                                |\n| HV line maintenance         | Brazil/Rio  | Casimiro de Abreu/Rio Tabicum | 1.5                                      | Schinus, Albizia, Cordia                                      | Forest  | Planting to offset trees removal (about 600 specimens)                                  |\n\nConservation of natural capital\nBiodiversity project to protect the huemul (Chile)\n\nThe huemul (*Hippocamelus bisulcus*) is a species of deer found in the area of influence of the \u00d1uble National Reserve, a forest reserve located near the hydroelectric plants located in the Laguna del Laja. It is a native species that is endemic to Chile and an emblem of the country, and is at risk of extinction according to the Red List of Threatened Species compiled by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The huemul population located in Los Nevados de Chill\u00e1n in central Chile is vulnerable due to its small size and highly fragmented distribution. Since 2018, Enel has participated in a multidisciplinary project led by the Chilean Ministry of the Environment to develop and implement the \u201cBiodiversity project to protect the huemul\u201d, which involves defining a plan for the restoration, conservation and management of the huemul population, with a view to reducing threats to the species and increasing protection measures through habitat restoration and conservation. In February 2022, the plan was approved by the Chilean Ministry of the Environment, recognizing Enel\u2019s contribution to conserving this species and preventing the risk of its extinction.\n\nEagle owl conservation project in Catalonia\n\nIn the first half of 2021, a project was launched in Catalonia (Spain) to monitor and conserve the eagle owl, which is the largest nocturnal bird of prey in Europe and whose conservation is under threat. Indeed, in Spain it is included in the \u201cList of Wild Species in Regime of Special Protection\u201d and in Catalonia it is listed as a protected species.\n\nThe project involves the adoption of specific measures to avoid the birds being killed by medium- and low-voltage lines, an initiative that is part of the voluntary projects of the Endesa Biodiversity Conservation Plan, developed with the Birding Natura company. For several weeks, a live webcam was used to display real-time activity in a nest in the plain of Lleida, in the region of Les Garrigues. In addition, radio tracking transmitters were placed on 6 eagle-owl chicks, tracking a total of 6 chicks and 6 adult birds. This measure provides information about their flight patterns during a period of one year, in order to identify and analyze the decisive factors in their development.\nBiodiversity Significance\\(^{(19)}\\) this qualitative indicator makes it possible to classify power generation plants according to the importance of biodiversity present in their vicinity (high/medium/low). The methodology therefore makes it possible to identify priority sites for the protection of biodiversity in order to ensure proper management to mitigate potential impacts. Also in this case it should be noted that most sites of high significance are related to hydroelectric plants, generally infrastructures built in mountain areas and present in the locality for many years.\n\nIn 2022, 4 new power generation plants were built in areas of high biodiversity value, 2 fewer than in 2021, including 3 in critical habitats and 1 in areas containing species at risk of extinction, for which action plans were developed to restore habitats and protect species.\n\n| Technology | Country | Plant | Land occupation (ha) | Significance | Critical species potentially impacted | Habitat | Biodiversity projects |\n|------------|---------|-------|----------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|---------|----------------------|\n| Solar      | Spain   | Sol de Casaquemada | 77 | Critical habitat | Nyctalus lasiopterus, Rhinolophus mehelyi, Otis tarda, Tetrax | Grassland | Installation of nests, perches, insect boxes and bird feeders |\n| Solar      | Spain   | Torrecilla | 118 | Critical habitat | Triturus boscai, Aquila adalberti | Wetlands and Grassland | Habitat improvement for amphibious reptiles and other faunal groups: restoration of ponds to promote biodiversity |\n| Solar      | Spain   | Can Lloreta | 6 | Critical habitat | Olea europaea | Grassland | Restoration of degraded area |\n| Wind       | Spain   | Tico | 9 | Endangered species | No endangered species mapped in the project area | Wetlands and Grassland | Monitoring of birds and bats: - baseline definition and species conditions; - impact monitoring before and during construction |\n\nPresence of endangered species near plants/assets: knowledge of protected species potentially present in the vicinity of assets is important in order to evaluate the actions needed to reduce the risk of interference by Enel assets. This type of mapping is carried out for all infrastructures for which biodiversity projects are developed and includes both flora and fauna species. The summary of this mapping is presented in the infographic table of biodiversity projects.\n\n\\(^{(19)}\\) To identify areas of high biodiversity importance, the following general criteria are considered: 1) Protected areas (UNESCO World Heritage Natural Sites and IUCN I-IV); 2) Critical habitats as defined by IFC Performance Standard 6; 3) Presence of endangered species, according to the methodology developed and adapted by UNEP-WCMC, Conservation International and Fauna & Flora International (\"Biodiversity indicators for site-based impacts\", 2020).\n| Country     | No. of projects | Mandatory | Voluntary | of which voluntary | Monitoring | Conservation (species) | Restoration (habitats) | Research and other purposes | Group | CR | EN | VU | NT | LC | Total |\n|-------------|----------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|-------|----|----|----|----|----|-------|\n| Argentina   | 3              | 2         | 1         | 33%               | 1          | 1                     | -                     | 1                        |       |    |    |    |    |    |       |\n| Brazil      | 46             | 38        | 8         | 17%               | 16         | 7                     | 21                    | 2                        | Birds; Mammals; Fish; Plants | 1   | 9  | 36 | 58 | 285 | 389 |       |\n| Chile       | 27             | 12        | 15        | 56%               | 9          | 6                     | 6                     | 6                        | Birds; Plants               | -   | -  | 3  | 3  | 69  | 75  |       |\n| Colombia    | 15             | 6         | 9         | 60%               | 4          | 5                     | 4                     | 2                        | Birds; Plants; Reptiles     | -   | 2  | 3  | 5  | 58  | 68  |       |\n| Greece      | 2              | 1         | 1         | 50%               | 2          | -                     | -                     | -                        | Birds                       | -   | 1  | 3  | 3  | 60  | 67  |       |\n| Guatemala   | 8              | -         | 8         | 100%              | 5          | -                     | 3                     | -                        | Birds; Plants; Amphibians and Reptiles | 3   | 3  | 4  | 8  | 80  | 98  |       |\n| Iberia      | 48             | 8         | 40        | 83%               | 2          | 32                    | 8                     | 6                        | Birds; Bats; Mammals; Plants | -   | 6  | 14 | 13 | 46  | 79  |       |\n| Ireland     | 1              | -         | 1         | 100%              | -          | 1                     | -                     | -                        | -                            | -   | -  | -  | -  | -   | -   |       |\n| Italy       | 30             | 8         | 22        | 73%               | 6          | 21                    | 3                     | -                        | Birds; Bats; Mammals; Plants; Fish | 3   | 3  | 18 | 4  | 37  | 65  |       |\n| Mexico      | 4              | 4         | -         | -                 | 4          | -                     | -                     | -                        | Birds; Bats; Plants         | -   | 1  | 6  | 8  | 38  | 53  |       |\n| Panama      | 1              | 1         | -         | -                 | -          | -                     | -                     | 1                        | -                            | -   | -  | -  | -  | -   | -   |       |\n| Peru        | 5              | 3         | 2         | 40%               | 3          | 2                     | -                     | -                        | Birds; Plants               | -   | -  | -  | 1  | 2   | 3   |       |\n| Romania     | 9              | 3         | 6         | 67%               | 3          | 6                     | -                     | -                        | Birds                       | -   | 1  | 5  | 2  | 7   | 15  |       |\n| South Africa| 1              | 1         | -         | -                 | 1          | -                     | -                     | -                        | Birds; Bats                 | -   | 3  | 1  | 1  | 18  | 23  |       |\n| Total       | 200            | 87        | 113       | 57%               | 56         | 81                    | 46                    | 17                       |                               | 7   | 29 | 93 | 106 | 700 | 935 |       |\n\n**Assessment of ecosystem services**: among the approaches that have been developed for some years in the scientific community to describe fully the contribution provided by biodiversity and nature, one relates to the optimization of ecosystem services. In this area, Enel continues to develop studies to verify how this approach facilitates better environmental management of its infrastructures in order to maximize the benefits for the environment and for local communities (see the dedicated box: \u201cOptimization of ecosystem services in Chile\u201d).\nEvaluation study of ecosystem services in the Fundaci\u00f3n Huinay\n\nEnel carried out a study in Chile to identify and enhance the most relevant ecosystem services in natural areas taken as a benchmark, in order to propose management measures for their conservation. In addition to the 5 areas assessed last year (totaling an area of 10,300 ha) which are part of the appurtenances of a number of hydroelectric plants owned by Enel in Chile, in 2022 a survey was conducted on a further 34,300 ha owned by the Fondaci\u00f3n San Ignacio del Huinay, of which Enel is a founding member together with the Pontifical Catholic University of Valpara\u00edso.\n\nEcosystem services have been classified according to the \u201cCommon International Classification of Ecosystem Services\u201d (CICES) (https://cices.eu/), which selects and classifies services through participatory methods, applying internationally accepted standards. These are presented in three main areas, namely: cultural services, regulating and provisioning. The main ones are shown below:\n\nThe significant theoretical aspect of the environmental factor has become an economic model, put into practice on a conceptual level and tested in various environments, both industrial and uncontaminated, yielding useful results for making socio-environmental decisions.\n\nThe numbers at a glance\n\n- **Ecosystem services**\n  - **845,110 \u20ac/year**\n    - Economic value creation\n  - **34,311 ha**\n    - Analyzed surface\n  - **109,705 tCO\u2082/year**\n    - CO\u2082 capture potential\n  - **18**\n    - Ecosystem services analyzed and leveraged for a Management Plan\n\nConservation of natural capital\nHuinay \u2013 POETA Program \u2013 an example of a partnership for researching the impacts of climate on nature\n\nIn 2021, Fondazione Centro Studi Enel signed a partnership agreement with Fondaci\u00f3n San Ignacio del Huinay with the aim of developing joint projects involving research, analysis and scientific studies. The partnership encompasses ecological issues, management and conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity, and focuses on the development of the POETA program (Observation of the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem of Chilean Patagonia) which was launched in 2018 with the aim of giving a scientific response to the climate emergency in Chile and around the world. Specifically, the program has a twofold objective: the first is to conduct long-term monitoring of the essential variables of the climate and the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of Chilean Patagonia, through a network of automatic stations, field sampling and remote detection; the second is to provide, with the help of the GEOOs portal (Observational Geoportal), a freely accessible, real-time data management and information transfer system useful for decision-making.\n\nReducing pollution\n\nThe reduction of the environmental impacts associated with the operation of our plants is a strategic objective for us, pursued through the application of the best technologies available and best international practices. During 2022, Enel continued its commitment on the path towards decarbonization. However, it should be noted that, due to the ongoing energy contingency in some countries in our perimeter, there was an overall increase in coal-fired generation compared with 2021, particularly in Italy due to the disconnection of energy supplies from Russia. For details on greenhouse gas emissions, please refer to the chapter \u201cZero emissions target\u201d. The constant commitment to improving air quality in the areas where Enel operates is demonstrated by the care paid to reducing the main atmospheric pollutants associated with thermal generation: sulfur oxides (SO\u2082), nitrogen oxides (NO\u2093), and dust. To this end, over the years numerous measures have been taken to improve the environmental performance of most of the thermoelectric plants in the company\u2019s fleet, beginning from best technologies and international practices and taking into consideration factors such as context and local priorities, the plant configuration and its potential service life. For years, the Group has set itself important objectives to reduce specific emissions of pollutants emitted into the atmosphere by 2030. In line with the SBTi certification process with respect to the Group\u2019s GHG emissions, which involved revising the 2017 targets and baseline net of asset deconsolidations as at December 31, 2022, the 2017 target values and the baseline for the main environmental indicators were also revised. In particular, for emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere, the new targets include:\n\n(20) For reference, see the chapter \u201cZero emissions ambition\u201d.\n\nSustainability Report 2022\nStarting from this year, the target of reducing Hg emissions from coal-fired thermoelectric plants by 100% compared to the year of reference will also be introduced.\\(^{(21)}\\) Pollutant reduction trends and targets are consistent with the Strategic Plan and with the Group\u2019s decarbonization objective.\n\nEmission measurements are carried out in compliance with each Country\u2019s regulatory framework and, in the majority of large plants, a measurement system is used that can assess compliance with the limits in real time. Its reliability is guaranteed by accredited certifying entities and through assessments carried out by inspection authorities.\n\nIn 2022 there was a slight decrease in NO\\(_x\\) emissions, in both absolute and specific terms, linked to the concomitant lower overall generation of gas and CCGT plants. By contrast, SO\\(_2\\) and dust emissions are in line with last year. In particular, specific emissions of SO\\(_2\\) totaled 0.07 g/kWh\\(_{eq}\\) (in line with 2021, which was 0.07 g/kWh\\(_{eq}\\)). NO\\(_x\\) emissions 0.32 g/kWh\\(_{eq}\\) (\u22128.6% compared with 2021, which was 0.35 g/kWh\\(_{eq}\\)) and dust 0.005 g/kWh\\(_{eq}\\) (in line with 2021, which was 0.005 g/kWh\\(_{eq}\\)). For mercury emissions, the value for the year 2022 was 75 kg of Hg, down 81% compared with 2017. For these emissions\u2014which have also always been subject to constant monitoring and reduction in all plants of the coal-fired thermoelectric park through the adoption of the best available and technologically applicable abatement techniques\u2014as previously stated, the target value of 0 kg of Hg (\u2212100%) by 2030 was set, in line with the expected closure of all coal-fired plants by 2027, whereas the value set for 2025 is 14 kg of Hg (\u221296% vs 2017).\n\n---\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) Values recalculated net of corporate deconsolidations as at December 31, 2022.\n\n\\(^{(2)}\\) The values for 2022 recalculated net of previous corporate deconsolidations are 0.29 g/kWh for NO\\(_x\\), 0.08 g/kWh for SO\\(_2\\) and 0.006 g/kWh for dust.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{(21)}\\) The target refers to the Countries for which this measure is prescribed and therefore includes Italy, Spain and Chile, whereas Colombia is excluded. The baseline value of 387 kg of Hg, referred to the year 2017, was calculated net of corporate deconsolidations as at December 31, 2022.\nUsing water responsibly\n\nThe responsible use and conservation of water resources are fundamental guarantees for the protection of natural habitats and for the wellbeing of the people around us who use the ecosystem services provided by these resources, as well as being essential for the success of our own activities, which also depend to a significant extent on the responsible use and conservation of water resources. For this reason, the responsible use of water has been included among the strategic objectives of our environmental policy and is pursued using an integrated management approach.\n\nThe preliminary analysis of environmental risks and opportunities, conducted based on the TNFD criteria and reported in the chapter \u201cIdentification of impact factors and dependencies on nature and biodiversity\u201d, particularly highlighted the materiality, for some energy generation technologies, of impacts linked to the use of water resources, above all fresh water and particularly in areas with high water stress, where competition between natural and human needs is greatest.\n\nSpecifically, the main impacts are above all linked to water withdrawal mainly for industrial purposes. Water is largely used in thermal and nuclear generation, for the cooling of thermal cycles and for operating atmospheric emission abatement systems. Overall water requirements for generation are covered, where available, through withdrawals from so-called \u201cnon-scarce\u201d sources (mainly including sea water, which is used as-is in open cycle cooling processes and subjected to desalination to obtain industrial water) and, where necessary, from \u201cscarce\u201d sources, represented by surface water, groundwater and water for civilian use. To minimize these withdrawals, as well as maximize the restoration of internal wastewater, Enel uses, where available, treated wastewater supplied by water management consortia.\n\nThe main dependencies are instead attributable\u2014in addition to the aforementioned needs of thermal plants\u2014to hydroelectric plants, which, despite having negligible water consumption, depend for their operation on the water cycle which, through rainfall and the melting of snow, constantly replenishes surface watercourses (for further information, see the following paragraph \u201cResponsible and integrated management of water catchment areas\u201d).\nEfficient use of water resources\n\nIn 2022 total consumption of process and cooling water in a closed cycle\\(^{(22)}\\) was approximately 76.0 x10\\(^3\\) ML, a moderate increase compared to the 2021 figure\\(^{(23)}\\) (73.1 x10\\(^3\\) ML), due to the ongoing international energy contingency and the consequently greater need for electricity generation from coal-fired plants (which are expected to be closed by the end of 2027). As for the specific water requirement\\(^{(24)}\\) in 2022 it was 0.27 l/kWh, slightly down on 2021\\(^{(25)}\\) (0.29 l/kWh), despite the moderate increase in consumption volumes, thanks to the simultaneous growth of the renewable generation park.\n\nEnel is constantly committed to progressively reducing the specific need for water for its plants and assets, through the efficient use of water in existing thermal plants, the evolution of the energy mix towards renewables, and the progressive reduction of generation from fossil fuels. Among the efficiency measures, particular attention is paid to maximizing the recovery of process wastewater leaving treatment plants and to measures to increase the efficiency of cooling systems and evaporative towers, by upgrading the control and recovery systems of the drains. Other important optimization interventions concerned the use of crystallizers\\(^{(26)}\\), a technology that allows the complete reuse of waste water in the production cycle, eliminating its discharges (ZLD \u2013 Zero Liquid Discharge plants). Finally, great importance is given to the reuse of rainwater collected in plant areas, which cannot be returned as-is to natural receptors as it is potentially contaminated by contact with industrial surfaces. This water is stored in special storage tanks and reused in the generation processes, thus further helping to reduce the environmental footprint of our generation sites.\n\nMeasures to improve efficiency in the use of water also make it possible to minimize water effluent as well as total consumption, which are respectively 30.8 x10\\(^3\\) ML and 45.2 x10\\(^3\\) ML.\n\nWater withdrawal by source 2022 (76 x10\\(^3\\) Mega liters)\n\n\\(^{(22)}\\) The waters used for open cycle cooling are reported separately among the environmental indicators. They are not taken into consideration here in assessing the efficient use of the water resource, as they are returned in full to the natural receptors, without substantial changes in quality, apart from a slight increase in temperature, subject to authorization and continuous control in order to guarantee the absence of measurable impacts on exposed ecosystems.\n\n\\(^{(23)}\\) The total value of process and closed-loop cooling water withdrawal for the year 2021 was recalculated following the refinement in 2022 of the way in which water withdrawn for cooling purposes at certain nuclear power plants in Spain was calculated.\n\n\\(^{(24)}\\) Water needs are constituted by all the water withdrawal quotas from surface (including recovered rainwater) and groundwater sources, by third parties, from the sea and from wastewater (quota for third party procurements) used for processes needs and for closed-cycle cooling, except the quota of seawater discharged back into sea after the desalination process (brine). This latter item (brine) contributes to the total quota of withdrawals.\n\n\\(^{(25)}\\) Value also recalculated to take into account the reclassification of the cooling cycles of some nuclear power plants in Spain.\n\n\\(^{(26)}\\) Crystallizers or SEC plants, named after Softening, Evaporation and Crystallization processes.\nThe new target for reducing specific fresh water withdrawal and the focus on water-stressed areas\n\nStarting this year, Enel has renewed and relaunched its commitment to conserving water resources by adopting a new, even more challenging target aimed at reducing specific withdrawal of fresh water.\n\nSpecific fresh water withdrawal (l/kWh)\n\n| Year   | Value (l/kWh) |\n|--------|---------------|\n| 2017   | 0.43          |\n| 2022   | 0.23          |\n| 2025   | 0.19          |\n| Target | 0.15          |\n\n(1) Value recalculated net of corporate deconsolidations as at December 31, 2022.\n(2) The value for the year 2022 recalculated net of previous corporate deconsolidations is 0.22 l/kWh.\n\nThe target set by the Group for 2030 is a 65% reduction in specific withdrawal of fresh water compared with the base year 2017. As already stated, both in this case and as regards the Group\u2019s GHG emission reduction targets, the baseline value for 2017 was recalculated to take into account the deconsolidations that took place in the reporting period (see the chapter \u201cZero emissions ambition\u201d).\n\nThe new target of reducing specific fresh water withdrawals, turning attention to the most valuable and vulnerable water resource, testifies to the even more explicit commitment to the protection of natural habitats and the needs of local communities. The objective takes into account future developments envisaged by the European legislation on sustainability reporting standards (proposed standard EU EFRAG ESR-S-E3 \u201cWater and marine resources\u201d), and the results of the risk and priority analysis carried out at Group level in line with the main international standards being defined (TNFD and SBTN).\n\nThe commitment is pursued through the definition, at Group level, of common strategies and specific objectives, which are implemented locally through the adoption of Environmental Management Systems on all assets for which the resource is material, as well as through water management plans for hydroelectric plants combined with continuous improvement programs shared with local stakeholders (dam authorities, local administrations, control bodies, citizens\u2019 committees and NGOs). The measures of impact mitigation and improvement, defined in the management plans, are linked to the guarantee of minimum vital flow and the protection of habitats (see the specific websites of the Environmental Authorities of the various Countries where the group is present).\n\nDuring 2022, a total of 52.7 x10^3 ML of fresh water was withdrawn for process and closed-loop cooling uses, a slight decrease compared with 2021 (55.5 x10^3 ML), with the specific fresh water withdrawal value at group level standing at 0.23 l/kWh (down on last year\u2019s value of 0.25 l/kWh).\n\nEnel also pays particular attention to the vulnerability of the resource, by mapping and constantly monitoring all generation sites located in areas classified as water-stressed areas. Mapping of generation, thermal, nuclear and renewable sites falling within water-stressed areas is done in line with the criteria of GRI 303 (2018) with reference to the conditions of \u201c(baseline) Water Stress\u201d indicated by the World Resources Institute Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas.\n\nAmong the sites mapped, those defined as \u201ccritical\u201d are those positioned in water-stressed areas and which procure significant volumes of fresh water. For these sites, which are specifically thermoelectric and nuclear plants that use water resources for process and closed-cycle cooling needs, water management methods and process performance are constantly monitored, in order to minimize consumption and favor withdrawals from sources of lower quality or which are non-scarce (wastewater, industrial or sea water).\n\nThe percentage of water withdrawn in water-stressed areas was approximately 19.3% of total withdrawals in 2022 (23% in 2021). In particular, fresh water withdrawals in water-stressed areas amounted to 12.4 x10^3 ML, generated by 7 significant plants, with an 18% reduction compared with the 2021 value (15.3 x10^3 ML), thanks to optimization actions and the reduced generation of some gas plants located in areas with high water stress.\n\n(27) The values of which have also in this case been recalculated to take into account the corporate divestitures that have taken place in the intervening years.\n(28) GRI 303 defines \u201cwater stressed\u201d areas as those in which, based on the classification provided by the WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, the ratio, referred to as \u201cbaseline water stress\u201d, between total annual surface and groundwater withdrawals for different uses (civil, industrial, agricultural and livestock) and the renewable water supply available annually is high (40-80%) or extremely high (>80%). By way of greater environmental protection, those plants located in areas classified by the WRI as \u201cacid\u201d due to the unavailability of water are also considered as located in water stressed areas.\n(29) Plants with withdrawals greater than 100 m^3/year are included.\nThe specific withdrawal of fresh water in water-stressed areas was 0.12 l/kWh in 2022 (0.16 l/KWh in 2021), lower than the general Group value shown above, demonstrating the Company\u2019s priority commitment to adopting, in water-stressed areas, renewable technologies (solar and wind) that do not require significant quantities of fresh water or, in the case of thermoelectric plants, sea water desalination technologies.\\(^{(30)}\\)\n\nThe strong expansion of the solar plant fleet, which is naturally intended for installation also in water-stressed areas, has nevertheless highlighted potential criticalities for some of these plants resulting from the need to clean the photovoltaic panels in order to remove dust deposited on their surfaces: although such volumes are insignificant, Enel has adopted innovative solutions for these plants aimed at drastically reducing their water consumption (see the following box on the Roboost project).\n\nIn 2020, the Enel Green Power and Thermal Generation division launched the WaVE (Water Value Enhancement) project in order to reduce the use of water resources in all thermoelectric and renewable power generation sites, and to identify improvement actions, particularly in water-stressed areas. The project continued in 2022, refining the mapping of assets and focusing on the effects that climate change may have on the availability of water resources.\n\n---\n\n**Roboost Project \u2013 Robotic washing of solar panels**\n\nOur solar plants are often installed in arid regions, where they can benefit from high sun exposure. Although the water consumption needed for washing the panels is low compared to that required for thermal generation, it is nevertheless important to aim at further reducing it in consideration of the particular context of water scarcity in these regions. This year, the methods used to wash our photovoltaic panels were subject to a thorough review, which identified automation as one of the key factors for reducing the amount of water needed to keep the systems efficient.\n\nIn this area, Enel is developing its own \u201cRoboost\u201d program of new solutions that use autonomous robots to clean the photovoltaic panels in a fully automatic way without using water. The expected water saving is 5 l/MWh. Initial trials were carried out at the Totana plant in the Spanish region of Murcia. Here, robots supplied by an Italian startup have already been used successfully, helping to reduce the water consumption needed to keep the panels efficient in what is one of Spain\u2019s most arid regions. The installation of other robotic systems is being planned, with the participation of other suppliers: one of the first countries involved will be Chile, where all our solar plants are located in desert regions with high water stress, and where saving water resources is therefore of paramount importance. Being completely electric, the autonomous robots also avoid generating any greenhouse gas emissions during the panel cleaning operations.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{(30)}\\) The quantities of fresh water withdrawn and the energy generated in water-stressed areas are calculated taking into consideration both thermoelectric and renewable plants located in these areas. In the case of renewable plants managed in geographical clusters that include areas with different levels of water stress, the estimates of the previous quantities were made in proportion to their generation capacity.\nWaVE Project \u2013 Reduction of drinking water use in Peru\n\nEnel pays great attention to the use of drinking water in its industrial processes. Where, due to particular local constraints or contingent situations, its use is absolutely necessary, maximum effort is expended to reduce or eliminate it in the near future.\n\nDuring 2022, the Malacas gas plant in Peru replaced its old turbine burners with more modern \u201cDry low NOx\u201d type burners. These enable nitrogen oxide emissions to be reduced even without the need for injection of demineralized water, which was being produced using water from the municipal aqueduct. The saving obtained from this intervention was approximately 60 thousand m\u00b3/year of drinking water, equivalent to the annual requirement of a small community. The social benefits of reducing competition for the use of civil water infrastructure are therefore significant for the local community, given the scarcity of water resources.\n\nOptimization of liquid wastewater treatment\n\nDownstream of internal recoveries and reuses, wastewater discharged from the plants is returned to the surface water body. Discharge always takes place downstream of a treatment process that removes any pollutants present to a level where they will not have a negative impact on the receiving water body, in compliance with the limits provided for under national regulations and by operating permits. The potentially polluting substances present in our drains mainly consist of metallic species (Fe, Al, Si, Ca, Mg) in solution or, to a lesser extent, suspended solids. There are also no added nutrients (nitrates and phosphates), pesticides or other substances classified as dangerous.\n\nResponsible and integrated management of water catchment areas\n\nThe activities of hydroelectric power plants are an important element of water management. These power stations, which do not contribute to the Group\u2019s water consumption in that the water withdrawn is completely returned to its source, provide a series of additional services for the Company compared to the sole generation of renewable energies. A variety of power plants, jointly run by government and private stakeholders, manages the water resource for multi-purpose services ranging from flood control, drinking water and irrigation and firefighting services, to the management of river waste held by artificial dams, also including numerous cultural, leisure and nature-based initiatives, made possible thanks to the presence of the power plants. The reservoirs of hydroelectric plants also carry out a vital role in the response to the effects of climate change, increasing the level of protection of the communities subject to increasingly frequent severe flooding and to prolonged periods of drought. Management of the outflows from hydroelectric plants is done through specific programs to ensure the volumes of water required to preserve the ecological state of rivers (minimum vital water flows).\nManaging waste\n\nOptimal waste management is a strategic objective of Enel\u2019s environmental policy, which results in a constant commitment to reducing its generation, as well as to constantly devising new methods of reuse, recycling and restoration in the perspective of a circular economy of resources, in line with the principles indicated by the new EU proposal EFRAG ESRS E5 \u201cResource use and circular economy\u201d. These principles are further strengthened and integrated into Enel\u2019s operations in the Group Guidelines for Waste Management (PL No. 473), which Enel has adopted in order to collect and share best management practices and rules developed within the Company.\n\nThe target of reducing waste from operational and maintenance activities\n\nFor several years, Enel has been pursuing an important target of reducing waste produced by direct, operational and maintenance (O&M \u2013 Operation and Maintenance) activities carried out on its plants. The reduction target previously set, linked above all to the ongoing energy transition and to Enel\u2019s strategic decision to bring forward the closure of its coal-fired thermal plants, which accounted for the majority of waste produced (mainly ash and gypsum), has already been reached in the last few years (1.2 Mt in 2020 and 2021, which is the target value previously set for 2030).\n\nStarting this year, this target has been made more challenging by extending it to O&M waste produced by contractors who, operating on behalf of Enel, generate waste which they manage under their own responsibility as producers, in compliance with applicable laws, authorizations and mandatory qualification and management compliance criteria regularly verified by Enel as the contracting company.\n\nThis new adjustment of the target reflects the principles of extended responsibility of the waste producer, as recommended by the recently proposed EU standard EFRAG ESRS E5 \u201cResource use and circular economy\u201d. It also makes it possible to highlight, in the context of the ongoing energy transition, the growing role within the Company of the management of renewable plants and electricity and service distribution networks (for example, public lighting networks) with respect to the operational processes of thermoelectric plants.\n\nThe increase in the values reported this year is therefore attributable to the inclusion of O&M waste produced and managed by our contractors, mostly consisting of excavated earth and rocks and inert materials from civil and road construction and demolition, which in some main countries, including Italy, are classified and managed as waste and entirely destined for recovery.\n\nThe new target commits the Company to a 55% reduction in waste produced by direct and contracted O&M activities in 2030 compared with the base year 2017.\n\nWaste production from O&M activities (Mt)\n\n| Year | Waste Production (Mt) |\n|------|-----------------------|\n| 2017 | 6.7(1)                |\n| 2022 | 3.4(2)                |\n| Target 2030 | 3.0                  |\n\n(1) Values calculated net of corporate deconsolidations as at December 31, 2022.\n(2) The value for the year 2022 recalculated net of previous corporate deconsolidations is also 3.4 Mt.\n\nWaste produced in 2022 amounted to 3.4 Mt (corresponding to ~50% compared with 2017), a moderate increase compared to that recorded in 2021 (3.1 Mt, also recalculated to include waste produced in O&M activities by contractors), mainly as a consequence of the increase in coal-fired thermoelectric generation in some countries, mainly including Italy, following the ongoing international energy contingency.\n\nThe vast majority of waste produced (98.3%) is accounted for by waste classified as non-hazardous and mainly consisting of inert waste from construction and demolition, coal ash and excavated earth and rocks. In particular, pro-\nduction of ash from coal and gypsum from desulfurization, which is expected to be completely eliminated by 2030 following the planned decommissioning of coal-fired plants, was respectively 1.02 Mt in 2022 (52% vs 2021) and 0.11 Mt (57% vs 2021).\n\nWaste produced by O&M activities (3.4 Mt)\n\nThe overall percentage of O&M waste sent for recovery totaled 84.4%. The commitment to a continuous increase in the percentile recovery of waste produced is essential for an effective transition towards a circular economy that minimizes the exploitation of natural resources, in accordance with the objectives of sustainable development and reducing the Company\u2019s environmental impact and dependence on ecosystem services. Excavated earth and rocks (94.6%) and construction and demolition waste (86.9%) were recovered almost in their entirety, deriving mainly from the maintenance of power grids as well as of generation plants. Process waste from thermoelectric generation was also recovered to a significant extent, including coal ash and desulfurization gypsum, which were reused in building works to produce cement, concrete and bricks according to specific technical and environmental control requirements. In particular, the percentage sent for recovery was 80.4% for coal ash and 88.3% for desulfurization gypsum, improving on the results of the previous year (respectively 67% and 81% in 2021). Finally, industrial waste deriving from the maintenance of generation plants and electricity grids was mainly destined for recovery (88.1%), as was an even higher percentage (95.6%) of WEEE and metal waste, including iron, copper and aluminum.\n\nWaste produced by construction site activities\n\nThe objective of reducing waste produced by the operating and maintenance activities described above does not currently include waste deriving from the construction of new renewable plants and the demolition of thermoelectric plants at the end of their life, as these flows are specifically linked to the Group\u2019s strategy of decarbonization and energy transition. Above all, these activities are linked to the generation of inert materials, such as excavated earth and rocks, as well as valuable metal waste, in the case of the end-of-life decommissioning of plants. Enel is constantly committed to maximizing their recovery. In particular, for the recovery of waste deriving from the end-of-life decommissioning of plants, selective demolition techniques of the structures and dedicated management procedures are adopted to maximize their economic value. For more details, see the chapter \u201cCircular economy\u201d.\n\nIn 2022, waste produced on the construction sites of new renewable plants (wind and solar) and by the 3SUN Giga-factory totaled 0.09 Mt, which consisted almost exclusively of non-hazardous waste (99.9%). The same activities also produced 3.31 Mt of excavated earth and rocks, which was entirely reused in situ.\n\nBy contrast, waste from the end-of-life demolition of thermoelectric plants totaled 0.39 Mt. Waste from these activities consisted of 92.3% non-hazardous waste (mainly excavated earth and rocks, inert waste from construction and demolition and industrial waste, including mainly metals) with average recovery values of 76%, rising to 93% for\nthe metallic portion. Programs at country level and dedicated initiatives at plant level are aimed at optimizing the management of this waste, with a view to maximizing its recovery and value (see also the paragraph on the circularity of resources).\n\nFinally, with reference to the specific redevelopment site of the Enel headquarters in Viale Regina Margherita (Rome, Italy), launched in November 2019 for a duration of approximately 40 months and involving a total area of approximately 80 thousand m\u00b2, the amount of waste produced in 2022 totaled 26.4 kt, of which 98.2% (about 26.0 kt) consisted of demolition aggregates, glass and metals, which was entirely sent for recovery.\n\n**Improvement initiatives**\n\nAmong the most significant initiatives, within the Enel Green Power and Thermal Generation Division, the commitment made in 2020 continued with the launch of \u201cZero Waste\u201d, a global project that aims to reduce the amount of waste produced and improve the percentages of waste recovered through the sharing of best initiatives and good practices implemented in the various Countries. The global initiatives carried out in 2022 continued, notably including the commitment to engage Enel\u2019s contractors through awareness-raising and training initiatives and the adoption of contractual instruments to incentivize waste recovery.\n\nParticular attention was also paid to wind and solar technologies, in order to identify possible strategies for the reuse of components that are subject to replacement and disposal at the end of their life, mainly starting from 2030. As regards wind technology, the \u201cWind New Life\u201d project for the recovery of wind blades is continuing. Among the possible alternatives for their recovery, the project has also considered the processes of reusing and recovering energy from the turbine blade materials for concrete production. Meanwhile, the \u201cPhotorama\u201d project is dedicated to the reuse of photovoltaic panels, focusing above all on the most valuable and difficult-to-source materials, which are potentially reusable for the generation of new panels.\n\nAs regards waste produced by grid management activities, in continuity with the programs launched in previous years, Enel is continuing in its commitment to restoring hazardous and non-hazardous special waste, especially as regards dielectric mineral oils used as insulators in electrical equipment, which is delivered to authorized companies for regeneration or, if this option is not feasible, destined for waste-to-energy processes. Also ongoing are the initiatives launched in the various countries for the sustainable replacement of first-generation smart meters and the recovery of their constituent materials.\n\nFor further initiatives, see the chapters \u201cCircular economy\u201d and \u201cSustainable supply chain\u201d in this document.\n\nAs part of the provision of products and services for energy efficiency, in 2022 Enel X Global Retail continued its commitment to a sustainable approach that extends to the entire value chain, by further extending the requirement for its suppliers to provide transparent and comparable information on the environmental impact of the materials and products they supply. In particular, for own-brand products, Enel X Global Retail adopts the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) model, which also includes the post-consumer phase, by adhering to collective WEEE collection systems in all the markets in which it operates, as well as collection of batteries and packaging, and by launching end-of-life management initiatives for marketed products and optimizing their design with a view to maximizing their reuse and recycling. These initiatives notably include:\n\n- the ALVA (ALternativas de VALorizaci\u00f3n) project in Spain, aimed at improving performance in the management of waste from electrical and electronic equipment (see the dedicated box);\n- the agreement between Enel X Italia and CdC RAEE (Centre for the Coordination of Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment), whose partnership enables B2C distributors/installers contracted with Enel X Italia to use the WEEE collection service free of charge, as well as providing greater control/traceability of WEEE along the entire supply chain to the plants where they are ultimately destined;\n- a similar project in Peru, but applied to B2G public lighting, with the objective of both extending the life cycle of light bulbs that are still functional and the restoration treatment of spent bulbs through the WEEE RECOLECC consortium in order to recycle the raw materials, thereby creating value and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nSpain \u2013 ALVA Project (ALternativas de VAlorizaci\u00f3n)\n\nWith the aim of applying the principles of the circular economy and in compliance with environmental regulations on waste, Enel X Global Retail has developed a project for reusing and recycling electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) products or components taken back from customers.\n\nThe project applies to electronic devices marketed by Enel X which are subject to return, in the case of rentals, or replacement of EEE installed at the customer\u2019s premises (1-for-1 takeback). The objective of the project is to ensure virtuous management and traceability of products/waste in order to prioritize EEE reuse operations over disposal.\n\nThe project engages installers, a qualified repair company and the ECOTIC consortium in managing waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) in order to improve circularity, by providing full traceability of the installation/replacement process, and to increase the reuse and restoration percentages of WEEE in treatment plants, and consequently to reduce CO\u2082.\n\n- **61** installers who have signed the agreement with ECOTIC\n- **103** t WEEE collected (93\u201396% material recovery / 1\u20133% energy recovery)\n- **119** t CO\u2082 equivalent saved\n\n2022 results\nEnel is committed to the continuous application of the most advanced technologies available and best practices in order to minimize the possible environmental impacts deriving from its activities, using international standards as a benchmark even where the required environmental protection is less stringent. Among the areas of prevention, the highest level of attention is paid to the protection, monitoring and remediation of soil, subsoil and groundwater in the areas where plants and generation and service facilities are present in all Countries.\n\nThe protection of the environment matrices guides every phase of each asset\u2019s life, from design choices to construction, operation and end-of-life management. Both active and passive protection and safety measures will be used in the project phase to prevent and, in any case, minimize the risk of uncontrolled or accidental contact of potentially polluting substances (such as fuels, reagents, liquid and waste flows) with soils and subterranean waters. During plant operations, every process undergoes compliance controls as well as ongoing upgrades as required by the Environmental Management Systems to prevent and minimize the risks of any potential environmental contamination. At the same time, control plans are executed to monitor the condition of the previous environmental matrices. In the event of an accident, for example the accidental spillage of polluting substances, the timely application of the Stop Work and Emergency Management Policies makes it possible to prevent or minimize the risk of environmental impacts, rigorously complying with the provisions and the legal obligations of the various countries.\n\nFor the end-of-life management of power plants, once they have been made safe and prior to them being dismantled and the area reassigned for new development projects, Enel proceeds to verify further the environmental quality of the soil, subsoil and groundwater in the areas where the plant is located, according to the authorized provisions and legal requirements of the various countries. In the event of potential contamination phenomena, characterization of the environmental matrices in the areas potentially affected and, if necessary, implementation of safety measures and subsequent remediation, are executed according to intervention plans shared with the competent authorities and by resorting to specialist, qualified companies that are able to promptly restore the level of quality suitable for the intended use of the area (industrial, commercial, residential etc.). Particular focus is on power plants falling within large industrial hubs. In order to mitigate further the risk connected to the detention and consequent potential uncontrolled release of substances that can have an impact on the environment, numerous projects have commenced for their progressive substitution, for example, verifications under way on the use of vegetable (hence biodegradable) oil, replacing the traditional dielectric oil of mineral origin.\n\nWithin the context of the energy transition launched by Enel, particular importance is given to projects for converting decommissioned plants, with the aim of hosting new renewable generation and energy storage plants, in order to reuse the industrial areas, some common parts of the plant, and the main infrastructures. In this way it is possible to reduce the environmental impacts deriving from demolition and new construction activities, as well as the consequent social and economic impacts on the surrounding communities and stakeholders. In order to optimize the management of plant decommissioning projects, in 2021 Enel adopted dedicated Guidelines (\u201cEnvironmental issues management in power plants decommissioning\u201d), with the purpose of guaranteeing a standardized approach to identifying, preventing and managing environmental aspects related to the decommissioning of power plants. These Guidelines provide global guidance on applying best management practices in relation to all environmental aspects, including soil and groundwater management.\n\nWith a view to continuous improvement and minimizing the possible environmental impacts deriving from decommissioning activities, at the end of 2022 a further set of Guidelines was also issued (\u201cSustainable Repurposing Model\u201d) in order to ensure the increasingly sustainable end-of-life management of plants (see the dedicated box below).\nHabitat restoration to protect native species\n\nThe area affected by the environmental restoration project was previously used to store combustion ash from the \u201cEugenio Montale\u201d thermoelectric plant in La Spezia, Italy. Starting from 2020, following a project authorized by the competent bodies, a waterproof top cover (cap) was created for the two reservoirs on the site, aimed at making them permanently safe while also guaranteeing landscape restoration by planting and grassing the area. The capping activity, completed in July 2022, was carried out in conjunction with a habitat restoration project aimed at restoring and maintaining biodiversity in the area, which is considered \u201ccore\u201d, due to the presence of *Rana dalmatina* frogs (a protected species included in the IUCN National Red List).\n\nThe habitat restoration project envisaged the recreation of a semi-open humid environment (azonal *Phragmites australis* reed bed habitat) fed by a channel that conveys runoff surface water from the reservoir caps, in addition to planting native arboreal and herbaceous essences characteristic of submerged wetlands and humid and perhumid environments. This habitat, in addition to providing a safe place during the reproduction period for a species in need of protection such as *Rana dalmatina*, also plays an irreplaceable ecological role by providing a place of rest, shelter and food for numerous other animal species.\n\nFor further details, please refer to the chapter \u201cOur commitment to a just transition: leaving no one behind\u201d.\n\nSustainable Repurposing Model\n\nThe sustainable repurposing model aims to promote the standardized adoption of sustainable practices during all end-of-life disposal activities of plants and assets. The aim is to create synergies with the future redevelopment of the sites, while maximizing the positive environmental and social impacts of the entire process.\n\nTo achieve and monitor these objectives, a set of guidelines, a catalog of sustainable practices and specific KPIs have been created. In order to launch and promote the model, some pilot projects on decommissioned plants have been launched in Chile, Spain and Italy. The continuous monitoring, through KPIs, of environmental performance on important aspects such as the reduction of atmospheric emissions, the recovery and recycling of materials and waste, the efficient use of water and the improvement of soil and biodiversity will allow us to continue on our path towards an increasingly efficient energy transition. The proposed model includes, in particular, the identification and application of sustainable principles and practices related to the management of the environmental matrices of soil and groundwater, such as the restoration of reclaimed areas in compliance with the morphological, vegetative and landscape characteristics of the surrounding area, as well as the creation of habitats aimed at promoting biodiversity and ecosystem services.\nEnergy efficiency\n\nEnergy efficiency in production processes\n\nFor Enel, the efficient use of energy is a constant commitment that extends to the entire value chain and which is pursued through the implementation of operational excellence programs across the different Business Lines, both for operations and in buildings. In particular, targeted interventions are aimed at maximizing the efficiency of power generation plants as well as improving the operational efficiency of distribution networks.\n\nEnergy consumption is mainly represented by fossil fuels, to operate thermal power plants (with coal accounting for 19% and natural gas 45% in 2022), and by uranium, to operate nuclear power plants (27%). By contrast, a smaller amount of energy consumption is related to the operation of power generation plants relying on renewable sources (biomass and geothermal). Total direct consumption of energy for electricity generation in 2022 amounted to 1,108,069 TJ (26.5 Mtoe), which was basically in line (0.8%) with the energy consumption of fuel recorded in 2021 as a result of the increase in thermoelectric generation from coal (64,571 TJ, up by 46% on 2021), as well as from diesel and nuclear to a lesser extent, replacing generation from natural gas (-79,774 TJ, down 15% on 2021). The Group\u2019s energy intensity, which provides a measure of its operational efficiency, was 4.81 MJ/kWh eq in 2022, slightly down on the previous year (-0.36%). Activities to optimize the grid structure continued in 2022, allowing for a significant reduction in grid losses. These include progressively reducing single-phase power lines, constructing additional power lines to alleviate the overload on existing lines, using low-loss transformers, boosting the grid by using conductors with a greater cross-section, and rephasing primary transformer substations. Finally, the realization of new transformer stations that help reduce the length of low-voltage lines, which are characterized by higher levels of loss.\n\nConsumption of primary energy from renewable and non-renewable sources (1,000 TJ x10\u00b3)\n\n| Year | From non-renewable sources | From renewable sources |\n|------|-----------------------------|------------------------|\n| 2020 | 949                         | 55                     |\n| 2021 | 1,045                       | 55                     |\n| 2022 | 1,053                       | 55                     |\nEnergy efficiency and electrification products for customers\n\nThe electrification of final consumption has become a central element of Enel\u2019s strategy. Its intrinsic efficiency makes it the key partner in achieving sustainable goals globally. In line with this approach, several initiatives across our businesses were strengthened and consolidated in 2022 to support commitments towards clean electrification. In 2022, the interventions carried out by the Enel X Global Retail Business Line in relation to efficiency, technological innovation and reduction of CO\u2082 emissions in the sectors in which the division operates, were strengthened and consolidated. In the public lighting sector, work performed in 2022 by Enel X Global Retail in Italy, Spain, Chile, Colombia and Peru resulted in cumulative savings of approximately 177 GWh. In public transport, Enel X Global Retail participated in the commissioning of more than 500 new electric buses in Chile, Colombia, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom in 2022.\n\nFor its B2C (Business to Consumer) customers in Italy, Spain, Chile and Romania, in 2022 Enel X Global Retail installed about 78 thousand energy-efficient products, including condensing boilers, air conditioners, air-to-water heat pumps and photovoltaic plants (some with storage systems), while in the B2B (Business to Business) sector, the photovoltaic plants managed by Enel X Global Retail for its customers in Brazil, Spain, Italy, North America and Korea in 2022 made possible a generation of distributed renewable energy equal to about 42 GWh, in addition to the energy savings obtained by the cogeneration and trigeneration plants managed by Enel X Global Retail in Italy and Spain. Overall in 2022, Enel X Global Retail\u2019s efficiency and electrification products and services enabled its customers to avoid the emission of approximately 130 thousand tons of CO\u2082, equivalent to an environmental benefit of more than 7 million trees per year, values calculated by applying algorithms validated by an internationally recognized certification body according to the principles identified in the UNI EN ISO 14064-2:2019 standard.\n\nFor further details, see the chapter \u201cClean electrification\u201d.\n\nEnvironmental legal disputes\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the number of legal proceedings pending was 168 across the whole Group. The main environmental disputes related to Italy, Latin America and Iberia. The amount of fines imposed or paid in 2022 was approximately 1.8 million euros. In addition, 22 non-mandatory sanctions were issued.\n\n(31) The relevance threshold for fines is 10,000 USD, therefore only sanctions that individually exceed this amount are reported.\nBelow the 2022 results related to the targets of the previous 2022-2024 Sustainability Plan, the resulting progress and the targets of the 2023-2025 Sustainability Plan, which may be redefined, added to, or surpassed with respect to the previous Plan.\n\n| SDG | Activities | 2022 results | Progress | 2023-2025 targets | Tag |\n|-----|------------|--------------|----------|-------------------|-----|\n| 16  | Definition of a strategic framework relating to the management of human rights in business operations, implementation of the ensuing action plans, analysis of the results and tailoring of the inputs to update the initial framework including any evolution of the international landscape | Definition of framework achieved through update of existing framework to keep abreast of the evolution of the international reference frameworks and of our operating, organizational and managerial processes | \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf | Implementation of action plans resulting from the definition of the strategic framework on human rights management in business operations, analysis of results, tailoring of the inputs and updating of the strategic framework (also in view of the evolution of the international context) | E S G |\n\nFor further information on the targets included in the Sustainability Plan, please refer to the Human Rights Content Index.\nManaging human rights\nManaging human rights\n\nOur pledge to respect human rights is the guiding principle that permeates all our activities, and it is fully integrated into our corporate purpose and values, since we belong to the territory, and we are an essential element in the lives of people, businesses, and society at large. We have adopted the approach of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, setting up a human rights management system based on three pillars:\n\nOur commitment\n\nOur strategic approach\n\nProtection of the environment and natural resources, climate action, and contribution to a sustainable economic development are strategic factors in the planning and development of our operations, alongside our broader commitment to accelerate the decarbonization and electrification processes, in accordance with the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The mitigation of the effects of the increasing environmental degradation and of climate change cannot take place without taking into account their social impact and that is why we believe that transition to net zero should be fair and inclusive.\n\nWe measure our commitment by acting in such a way that those who work with us do so in just and favorable conditions, that their health, safety and wellbeing are pivotal to creating value and that the rights of the communities with which we interact, as well as those of our customers, are respected.\n\nA strategic approach aimed not only at mitigating risks in a reactive way, but at managing them proactively by identifying the relative opportunities and exploiting the potential for growth and the creation of shared value.\nWe promote the growth of a constructive dialogue that can really help - in an effective way - with tackling the challenges brought by the social impacts of decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement, and we have committed to a just transition that does not leave anyone behind.\n\nContinuous innovation and embedding of circularity principles are also cornerstones for building a competitive, inclusive and sustainable business model. Indeed, a sustainable business conduct based on international reference standards is key to unlock multiple competitive advantages, such as increasing talent attraction & retention, strengthening corporate resilience, meeting customers & civil society expectations, improving access to stock & capital markets, shaping regulation & promoting system advocacy.\n\nRespecting Human Rights is a fundamental element to empower sustainable progress.\nOur public commitment: the Human Rights Policy\n\nIn 2013 Enel has adopted a Human Rights Policy, approved by the Board of Directors, which has been updated in 2021 to keep abreast of the evolution of the international reference frameworks and of our operating, organizational and managerial processes.\n\nThe Human Rights Policy leverages commitments already included in several codes of conduct like the Code of Ethics (adopted as early as 2002), the Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan and the global compliance models while at the same time strengthening and expanding their content.\n\nThe content of our policy refers to internationally recognized human rights as defined in the International Bill of Human Rights and in the International Labor Organization conventions underlying the Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy and applicable to business practice.\n\nThe commitment also reaches out to:\n\n- the 10 Principles of the Global Compact that we have joined as an active member since 2004;\n- the United Nations Pledge Letter we signed in 2019, in which the United Nations asked companies around the world to commit to a just transition and the creation of decent green jobs (for further details, please refer to \u201cOur commitment to a just transition: leaving no one behind\u201d);\n- the United Nations \u201cProtect, Respect and Remedy\u201d framework, set out in the guiding principles on business and human rights, and the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises, two of the main international soft law reference standards.\n\nThe policy addresses employment practices and community relations and society through 12 principles. Specifically, they establish our rejection of practices like modern slavery, forced labor, and human trafficking, to name a few, and our commitment to promoting diversity, inclusion, and equal treatment and opportunity, guaranteeing that people are treated fairly and valued for their uniqueness, as well as focusing on protection of the environment since a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment is integral to the full enjoyment of a wide range of human rights.\n\nThe principles have been identified based on their relevance to our business activities and relationships, as well as on the outcome of a consultation held with relevant stakeholders (people within our organization, as well as suppliers, human rights experts, think tanks, NGOs, other companies) held in line with the \u201cUN Global Compact Guide for business: how to develop a Human Rights Policy\u201d. Listening and taking account of stakeholders\u2019 perspectives in internal decision-making is, indeed, an integral part of our commitment to respecting human rights. For further details, please refer to \u201cMateriality analysis process and results for 2022\u201d \u201cOur commitment to a just transition: leaving no one behind\u201d and \u201cEngaging communities\u201d.\n\nOur commitment extends to supporting heightened responsible business conduct also through European reference organizations, like Eurelectric, the utility-sector one, through which, during 2022 we have continued to participate to the process concerning the development of the draft Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDDD).\n\nOther participations include the Solar Stewardship Initiative, launched by Solar Power Europe, the Global Alliance for Sustainable Energy, an independent global alliance, as well as the working groups within the Just Transition Think Lab, promoted by the United Nations Global Compact, the Business Commission to Tackle Inequality (BCTI), promoted by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), and CSR Europe Leaders Hub for an Inclusive Green Deal, selected group of members of CSR Europe. For further details, please refer to \u201cOur commitment to a just transition: leaving no one behind\u201d.\n\nManaging human rights\nPolicies and procedures\n\nIntegration of the commitment across relevant internal functions and processes is key to prevent and mitigate adverse human rights impacts as well as fostering decent work, inclusive economic growth and sustainable development.\n\nHereafter a summary classified by stakeholder and thematic group of the key internal policies and external frameworks integrating our Human Rights Policy.\n\nSecurity and human rights\n\nNational regulations generally set for security services employed to protect companies\u2019 personnel or property that they are assigned only to public forces, or to private forces in the absence of legislative provisions.\n\nIn both cases, our commitment is to promote that security forces act in a way consistent with the applicable national laws and international rules and standards and in line with the voluntary principles on security and human rights (principle 2.2.3 of our Human Rights Policy).\n\nSecurity services providers are selected following our overall procurement and monitoring process during the life of the contract and are therefore subject to the same ESG screening and contractual clauses as any other supplier. For further details, please refer to \u201cSustainable supply chain\u201d.\n\nFor providers included in the high reputational risk category, we also run additional checks regulated through a specific procedure (Counterparty Analysis), a further instrument in reducing and mitigating, as much as possible, actual or potential risks.\n\nOverall security management is entrusted to a dedicated function at Group level (Global security) which acts in coordination with relevant security functions at country level.\n\nMain activities are collecting and analyzing information to map potential security risk and related management, also in cooperation with external stakeholders like reference institutions and other critical infrastructure operators.\n\nAs for protection services for Enel people travelling in high-risk countries, providers are selected based on specific contractual frameworks managed by the Global Security function.\nTraining\n\nTraining and awareness-raising processes dedicated to both Enel people and business partners is a key part of embedding respect of human rights in business operations. Each year we carry out specific training to ensure that anyone working with us is aware of the role they play in ensuring respect of human rights while doing business. Such training also includes specific communication initiatives aimed at internal and external stakeholders to foster proper understanding of the commitment undertaken through the Human Rights Policy.\n\nThe training is deployed in different formats and content in order to meet every need, including:\n- courses on environmental protection;\n- courses on occupational health and safety;\n- courses on diversity and inclusion;\n- courses on relationships with communities;\n- courses on anticorruption;\n- digital training courses on issues closely linked with human rights;\n- training initiatives on best practices closely linked with human rights.\n\nIn 2022, 84% of Enel people attending courses on sustainability, confirming 2021 trend. Specifically, training hours were equal to approximately 1.9 million, with a per capita average of 28 hours. Training on human rights totaled some 7 thousand hours thanks to the online course that exemplifies the key role human rights play in business practice through simple stories and best practice sharing. On top of this, we run induction activities on human rights and business to selected audiences to promote internal awareness on our commitments and to stimulate improvement of its embedding into the operating practices. Activities for 2022 include:\n- a training session within the Executive Procurement School, organized with the support of a leading university and dedicated to our global procurement talents;\n- a deep-dive with all our country sustainability managers;\n- a training session dedicated to a selection of people working with us in renewable operations.\n\nGovernance\n\nRespect of our commitment in terms of human rights is an integral part of our corporate decision-making process. We rely on an organizational and corporate governance model, based on principles of transparency and accountability, that sets out well-defined tasks and responsibilities of the main governance bodies. Namely:\n- the Board of Directors, acting through the Control and Risks Committee and the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, which carry out preparatory work aimed at making proposals and providing advice, is responsible for examining the main company rules and procedures of relevance with respect to stakeholders and connected to the Internal Control and Risk Management System. These include our Human Rights Policy, our Code of Ethics, our Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan and our global compliance models. Both committees are in charge of providing recommendations for changes to the Board for approval, if necessary, in order to bring such procedures in line with national and international best practices and with modifications in applicable laws and regulations;\n- the Innovability\u00ae Function and, namely, the Sustainability Planning and Performance Management and Human Rights unit, is responsible for:\n  - managing the positioning on human rights and ensuring that it is correctly reflected in any internal and external communication activity;\n  - integrating respect of the principles included in our Human Rights Policy in corporate processes and planning and coordinating due diligence activities on the related management system, with the support of other units relevant to the process;\n  - reporting to the Control and Risk Committee and to the Corporate Governance and the Sustainability Committee on the implementation of the due diligence process and on the management of human rights-related activities;\n  - reporting annually within the Group\u2019s Sustainability Report how we respect human rights commitments.\nOur process of due diligence\n\nAs required by the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and human rights and by the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct, we have set up a process, which we have also codified in a global internal procedure, covering the entire value chain across our geographic footprint aimed at identifying if any of our operating procedures and processes require an improvement plan to strengthen the management system that ensures we comply with the commitments undertaken in our Human Rights Policy. Our process runs on a three-year cycle format, and involves both internal stakeholders by country of operation and function and external ones through human rights experts and key stakeholders. We have just completed the 2020-2022 cycle.\n\nPerceived risk assessment (identification of salient issues)\n\nIdentification of salient human rights issues allows us to better understand where to focus our efforts and resources for the potential impacts that require the greatest urgency, taking into account the relevant stakeholders\u2019 perspective.\n\nThe 2020 assessment run in our countries of operation with regard to labor, local communities, and environment-related rights involved stakeholders and experts in several fields, including civil society, and academic institutions. Specifically, consultations were held with direct and indirect workers, representatives of indigenous populations and local communities, trade unions, local institutions and peer companies.\n\nOutcomes of the assessment were then plotted into a human rights risk heat map based on the severity and the likelihood of a potential violation.\\(^1\\)\n\nHereafter, a summary of the most significant results:\n\n- risks connected to bribery practices and to impact on the environment ranked as \u201chigh-priority\u201d;\n- risks connected to labor practices violations (freedom of association and collective bargaining, rejection of forced and child labor, just and favorable working conditions, occupational health and safety, diversity and inclusion) and to potential impacts on local communities\n\n\\(^1\\) Risks are classified based on the assessment scale: acceptable risk (minimum level), risk to control, high-priority risk, high risk (maximum level).\nranked as \u201cto be monitored\u201d. Protection of local communities\u2019 rights ranked higher in Latin American countries, confirming the results of the previous cycle, given the widespread presence of such groups in that geographical region.\n\nIn addition, we periodically engage with our stakeholders and sustainability experts through the materiality analysis, a process that allows to identify material topics, i.e., the most significant impacts of the company on economy, environment, and people, including human rights impacts. For further details, please refer to \u201cMateriality analysis process and results for 2022\u201d.\n\nManagement of salient issues\n\nBesides the identification of salient issues, our management system includes:\n\n1. a gap analysis aimed at assessing our operating and risk monitoring processes and identifying any potential shortfall;\n2. development of improvement plan actions to meet the gaps identified at the previous step;\n3. implementation of actions and monitoring of progress.\n\nThanks to this process we assess 100% of the policies and operating procedures put in place to identify the risks of our direct and indirect operations along our entire value chain and of our new business relations (e.g., acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures, etc.). Hereafter, the main outcomes of the 2020\u20132022 cycle.\n\nGap analysis\n\nPractices and policies adopted to respect human rights across our geographic footprint were then assessed based on the human rights potential risks heatmap (please refer to \u201cAssessment of perceived risk \u2013 identification of salient issues\u201d) across relevant internal functions and processes to identify any existing gap. The assessment was based on the four parameters of the UNGPs operating principles:\n\n- public commitment to respect human rights;\n- adoption of human rights due diligence process;\n- preparation of a plan of action to remedy any gaps identified by the due diligence process;\n- adaptation to match local context and regulations.\nThis entailed interviewing the Top Management of the Group with the broad aim to get their strategic perspectives on business and human rights and assess awareness and perception of related risks and impacts and how they are managed.\n\nResults highlighted that the management system to potentially mitigate impacts is robust and should enable to adequately manage any identified risks, which considering the United Nations Guiding Principles framework ranking definitions means management of salient issues is adequate.\n\nBelow, a summary of key evidence:\n\n| Human Rights Principles | SDG | Main policies and procedures to protect human rights | Average perceived risk | System to protect human rights |\n|-------------------------|-----|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Labor practices         |     |                                                     |                        |                               |\n| Freedom of association and collective bargaining | 8   | Enel is committed to respecting the freedom and collective bargaining rights of its workers. In particular, Enel recognizes their right to set up or join organizations formed to defend and promote their interests; it recognizes their right to representation by union organizations or other forms of representation, opposing any action of discrimination in the exercise of this right; it recognizes their right to engage in collective bargaining as the preferred instrument to establish the contractual conditions and to regulate relations between company management and trade unions. | To control | Robust |\n| Rejection of forced labor | 8   | The contracts considered overall regulate labor conditions, clearly defining workers\u2019 rights (working hours, remuneration, overtime, indemnity, benefits). Each worker is guaranteed a translated employment contract in his/her native language. Human resources management systems and procedures guarantee the absence of minors in the workforce. Also apprenticeship projects and school-work experience models are carried out. | To control | Robust |\n| Just and favorable working conditions | 8   |                                                     |                        |                               |\n| Rejection of child labor | 8   |                                                     |                        |                               |\n| Diversity and inclusion | 5 10 | For details, please refer to \u201cEmpowering Enel people\u201d | To control | Robust |\n| Health and safety       | 3   | For details, please refer to \u201cOccupational health and safety\u201d | To control | Robust |\n| Community and society   |     |                                                     |                        |                               |\n| Community relations     | 1 3 | For details, please refer to \u201cEngaging communities\u201d | To control | Robust |\n| Environmental impacts   | 13  | For details, please refer to \u201cConservation of natural capital\u201d | High priority | Robust |\n| Corruption              | 16  | For details, please refer to \u201cValues and pillars of corporate ethics\u201d | High priority | Robust |\n\nAverage perceived risk: average perceived risk levels identified in the countries under analysis. Reference scale of risks: 1. High risk; 2. High-priority risk; 3. Risk to control; 4. Acceptable risk.\n\nThe results are expressed in percentage and represent the current maturity of the management systems with respect to the specific Human Rights areas. Reference scale of performance values: Robust (75%-100%); Good (50%-74%); Sufficient (25%-49%); To be improved (0%-24%).\nImprovement plans\n\nThe residual risk identified at the previous step led to the definition of the necessary remedies which were then included in the improvement plan both at country and at global level, therefore ensuring uniformity of processes and policies across the Group\u2019s activities. Hereby a few examples of the actions defined:\n\n- Italy: inclusion of the link to our Human Rights Policy in the local business development procedures of Enel Grids;\n- Argentina and Russia\\(^2\\): implementation of training and internal communication activities aimed at raising awareness on the importance of respecting the commitments included in the Human Rights Policy;\n- Brazil: definition of an operating instruction to assess management of human rights of partners and sub-tier suppliers;\n- Chile: i) implementation of a communication and awareness-raising campaign on the Human Rights Policy aimed at all relevant stakeholders; ii) making the policy available to all relevant stakeholders, with particular focus on those with no access to digital media (i.e., indigenous populations).\n\nAs for labor practices, the assessment revealed they are perceived as \u201clow risk\u201d given also the compliance of the related control measures and processes with our internal policies and with the main international standards. However, we identified several minor areas of improvement that are summarized in the table below.\n\n| Human Rights Principles | Business Lines | Countries | Areas of Improvement |\n|-------------------------|---------------|-----------|----------------------|\n| Freedom of association and collective bargaining | Sustainability/People and Organization | Greece, Australia, India, Brazil | Development of training programs on human rights aspects, with a special focus on the relationship with social partners and definition of working conditions during bargaining procedures |\n| Rejection of forced labor | People and Organization/ Sustainability/ Communications | Romania, Brazil | Integration of control procedures and definition of further remedies in the case of intimidation and threats |\n| Rejection of child labor | Global Procurement/Legal and Corporate Affairs | Russia\\(^2\\), Chile, Brazil | Intensification of training and monitoring of the supply chain |\n| Diversity\\(^3\\) | Sustainability, People and Organization | Mexico, Romania, Brazil | Each action plan includes activities on the topic of disability based on the main findings resulting from the Value for Disability project |\n\nImplementation and monitoring\n\nThe consolidated improvement plan for the 2020\u20132022 cycle includes 170 actions, covering 100% of operations and sites. At the end of 2022, we have achieved over 80% of the plan.\n\nFull effectiveness of the actions implemented will be assessed through the gap analysis that we will be run in 2023 when the new cycle will begin. Worth noting is that the next cycle will be based on the refreshed Human Rights Policy content.\n\nAs a further tool to measure the effectiveness of our human rights management system and governance structure across operations, in 2022 we carried out an asset-level due diligence activity on five pilot countries: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Italy, Iberia.\n\nIndeed, as instructed by the OECD Guidelines for multinational enterprises, in addition to standard assessments an enterprise may already employ, additional internal assessments may support a deeper understanding of the potential risks or actual adverse impacts with respect to an enterprise\u2019s own activities.\n\nThe outcome of the analysis confirmed the main results obtained by the overall due diligence process on the management system just described above in terms of robustness of labor practices issues and engagement with local communities. They also confirmed the key role awareness raising campaigns play.\n\n---\n\n\\(^2\\) On October 12, 2022, the Group has closed the sale of its entire stake in PISC Enel Russia.\n\n\\(^3\\) Diversity issues also include the assessment of aspects relating to equitable remuneration and non-discrimination.\nRelationships with stakeholders: human rights in practice\n\nThe workplace\n\nWe are committed to respecting and promoting internationally recognized workers\u2019 rights in all the countries where we operate. This means rejecting harmful practices like modern slavery, forced labor, and human trafficking, to name a few, and promoting diversity, inclusion, and equal treatment and opportunity, and guaranteeing that people are treated fairly and valued for their uniqueness throughout the entire value chain of the businesses in which we operate.\n\nAll of this has also been codified into the Charter of the Person, a memorandum of understanding adopted in Italy in 2022 and agreed with some trade union organizations. The Charter of the Person originates in a cultural context of transformation in which individuals are becoming aware of the importance of human relationships as a true engine of full realization. In the work carried out with the trade unions we look for the first time at the worker, who is not only and merely passive subject of protection and recognition but an individual who, in a new awareness, pursues a renewed balance between all its needs and inclinations.\n\nTraining and people empowerment\n\nUpskilling and reskilling\n\nWe believe in the importance of professional orientation and training for the development of our people and their skills, even the more so in situations impacted by the energy transition that prompt requalification and enhancement of potential by way of reskilling and upskilling programs to foster a just transition.\n\nFacing the undergoing rapid evolutions means setting up an inclusive working environment, aimed at enhancing the human being by placing him at the center of an ecosystem in which lifelong learning, well-being, productivity and safety can reinforce each other, contributing to the fullest realization of the person, in a perspective of ever greater centrality.\n\nFor further detail, please refer to \u201cOur commitment to a just transition: leaving no one behind\u201d.\n\nInclusion\n\nWe promote principles of diversity, inclusion, and equal treatment and opportunity, and we are committed to guaranteeing the right to working conditions that are respectful of personal dignity, as well as creating a working environment where people are treated fairly and valued for their uniqueness. We are committed to protecting the physical and psychological integrity and individuality of each person, and we oppose all forms of behavior that result in discrimination in relation to gender, age, disability, nationality, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, political opinions, and all other forms of individual diversity, or that is detrimental to the person and their convictions or preferences. Accordingly, we promote people\u2019s freedom of expression. We do not tolerate physical, verbal, visual, sexual, or psychological harassment such that results in a working environment that is denigrating, hostile, humiliating, intimidating, offensive, or unsafe.\n\nFor further detail, please refer to \u201cEmpowering Enel people\u201d and the \u201cValue for Disability\u201d box in this chapter.\n\nHealth & Safety and well-being\n\nWe consider health, safety, and psychological, relational, and physical well-being of individuals as the most precious asset to be protected in any moment, at work, as well as at home and during leisure time. We commit to disseminating a robust health, safety, and well-being culture across our organization, to ensure that workplaces are free from health and safety hazards and to promoting behaviors oriented towards work-life integration. We actively commit to foster personal and organizational well-being that are enablers of the engagement and innovative potential of people. We do, so, for example, by providing benefits and services that support the integration of private and working life (for example, support, including financial one, for childcare and maternity or for the care of the elderly).\n\nFor further detail, please refer to \u201cEmpowering Enel people\u201d and \u201cOccupational health and safety\u201d.\n\n360 Sustainability Report 2022\nIndustrial relations\n(Human Rights Policy, \u201cEmployment practices\u201d, principle 2.1.3 \u201cFreedom of association and collective bargaining\u201d)\n\nWe protect the right of the people working with us to form or take part in organizations aimed at defending and promoting their interests. Likewise, we respect their right to be represented, within the various working units, by unions or other forms of representation elected in accordance with the legislations and practices in force in the varying countries where they work. Collective bargaining is for us the favored instrument for setting contractual conditions of the people working with us as well as regulating relations between management and unions.\n\nThe Group industrial relations activities continue to be carried out according to the model provided for in the Global Framework Agreement (GFA) signed in Rome in 2013 with the Italian industry federations and the global federations IndustriALL and Public Services International, and which is still recognized as a reference best practice for European and non-European multinationals. The agreement is inspired by the best and most advanced systems of transnational industrial relations of multinational groups and institutions of international reference.\n\nFor further detail, please refer to \u201cEmpowering Enel people\u201d.\n\nProcurement activities and relationships with business partners\n(Human Rights Policy)\n\nBesides guaranteeing the necessary quality standards, our partners are requested to adopt best practices in terms of human rights and working conditions, occupational health and safety, environmental responsibility, and respect for data protection by design and by default.\n\nThey are also an integral part in our development and awareness programs: each person must feel that they are responsible for their own health and safety as well as for the others.\n\nIn terms of specific actions, we secure that our procurement processes are based on criteria that promote sustainable development and social stability, as well as on the principles of free competition, equal treatment, non-discrimination, transparency and rotation that go on top of complying with local legislation. 100% of the purchasing product categories are preliminarily evaluated in terms of risk, on the basis of human rights, environmental, social and economic criteria.\n\nIn addition, we support our partners to increase their resilience also in line with the promotion of practices based on a just and inclusive transition.\n\nFor further detail, please refer to \u201cSustainable supply chain\u201d and \u201cOccupational health and safety\u201d.\n\nCommunities\n(Human Rights Policy, \u201cCommunities and Society\u201d, principles 2.1.2, 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 \u201cRespecting the rights of communities\u201d, \u201cRespecting the rights of local communities\u201d, \u201cRespecting the rights of indigenous and tribal peoples\u201d)\n\nOur commitment testifies how much we are aware that our activities can have a direct or indirect influence on the communities where we operate and why we believe that responsible community relations constitute a pillar of our strategy. Indeed, individual conditions, economic and social development, and general well-being of collectivity are strictly connected: we therefore commit to conducting our capital expenditure in a sustainable manner and to promoting cultural, social and economic initiatives for the local and national communities involved to advance social inclusion through education, training and access to energy.\n\nWe take due regard for the cultural, social, and economic diversities from one country to another and require that each stakeholder deals with us in accordance with them, with a particular attention to conflict affected and high-risk contexts and vulnerable groups like local, indigenous and tribal ones and have committed to respect the International Labor Organization (ILO) Convention no. 169 on the rights of indigenous peoples.\n\nIn developing our projects, we commit to engage all the relevant stakeholders, including indigenous and tribal communities as we believe active community engagement throughout the process is essential.\n\nFor further detail, please refer to \u201cEngaging communities\u201d.\n\nCustomers\n(Human Rights Policy, \u201cEmployment practices\u201d, principle 2.1.2 \u201cRespect for diversity and non-discrimination\u201d, \u201cCommunities and Society\u201d, principles 2.1.2, 2.2.6 and 2.2.7 \u201cRespecting the rights of communities\u201d, \u201cPrivacy\u201d, \u201cCommunication\u201d)\n\nWe are committed to a just energy transition for everyone also through the offer of innovative and inclusive services for our customers, regardless of their age, for weak, destitute, marginalized, vulnerable people, paying particular attention to people with disabilities.\n\nWe undertake to always respond to suggestions and complaints made by customers and consumer associations, making use of appropriate and timely communication systems (e.g., call center services and email addresses), and to consider the needs of all our customers, paying once more particular attention to people with disabilities.\n\nWe have also committed to ensuring that our products and services are designed to be accessible for all and do not\ncompromise the safety and physical integrity of our customers, as far as reasonably foreseeable.\n\nInstitutional and commercial communications shall be non-discriminatory and respectful of different cultures, while also not adversely affecting the most vulnerable audiences, such as children and the elderly. This means, amongst other, that contracts and communications addressed to our customers should be clear and simple, drawn up using a language as close as possible to the one normally used by the people for which the message is intended to, be exhaustive, available on our website and accessible in order to be inclusive of vulnerable categories. For further detail, please refer to \u201cClean electrification\u201d.\n\nCross-cutting issues\n\nPrivacy\nWe respect the confidentiality and right to privacy of our stakeholders and we are committed to the correct use of the information and data relating to the people working in our organization, to our customers and to any other stakeholder. Data protection and processing are an important challenge for us in the era of digitalization and market globalization. We process personal data in compliance with the fundamental rights of data subjects and we abide by the rights and principles recognized in law, notably respect for private and family life, home location details and communications, personal data protection, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information.\n\nWe also undertake to monitor all third-party companies that may be in a position to use customers personal data. To this end, there are dedicated clauses in contracts with partners that use personal data to carry out specific activities, such as sales services or customer satisfaction surveys.\n\nInnovation\nInnovation and sustainability are inseparable parts of our strategy, together with the spirit of service and care for the well-being of people and the society in which we operate. That is why, in line with the Open Power vision, we also promote an open innovation approach to face the challenges of the energy transition. The open innovation model enables the connection of all the areas of the company with startups, industrial partners, small and medium-sized enterprises (\u201cSMEs\u201d), research centers, universities and entrepreneurs, also through the use of crowdsourcing platforms.\n\nThe aim is to foster the adoption of solutions that can enhance our sustainable profile, such as favoring circular economy approaches, which help reducing pressure on the use of resources and on supply chains, ensuring inclusivity, and trying to deal with social issues.\n\nFor further detail, please refer to \u201cInnovation\u201d.\n\nSpecific salient issues\n\nForced labor in the supply chain: the solar sector experience\nSince 2013, our commitment against forced or compulsory labor and any form of slavery and human trafficking has been formally set out in principle 2.1.1 Rejection of forced and compulsory labor and of child labor in our Human Rights Policy.\n\nWe are committed to contributing to reaching ambitious climate targets, which implies the need to electrify end uses as much as possible while supporting such electrification with a massive deployment of renewable energy production.\n\nPhotovoltaics (PV) represents a key technology to enable the energy transition in the European Union (EU) and worldwide, and we believe the EU needs to have strategic PV production inside its borders and to build the related supply chain.\n\nAware of the challenge ahead of us and of expectations around business contribution to human development also through the UN\u2019s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which go beyond specific legislation, our supplier qualification and contract-awarding processes include rigorous technical, financial, legal, environmental, health and safety, human rights and ethical integrity requirements, applied consistently in all markets.\n\nMoreover, we are pushing for the suppliers to adopt a traceability system to collect information on the supply chain, as well as seeking to visit the companies involved along the supply chain.\n\nFinally, we carry out a number of initiatives to improve transparency across the supply chain both individually and working jointly with other utilities, our suppliers and sector associations (i.e., Global Alliance for Sustainable Energy and Solar Power Europe, to name a few). For further detail, please refer to \u201cOur commitment to a just transition: leaving no one behind\u201d.\n\nOn top of this, we are working to get to the roots of the issue. Indeed, we are convinced that if we leverage on the momentum for renewables, thanks to the existing R&D and industrial know-how still present in the EU and with support from the EU itself, a new roadmap can be created toward a European industry for solar panels.\n\nThat is why we welcomed the public consultation(4) launched in January 2022 by the European Commission on the EU solar energy strategy that gathered input on the main bottlenecks and barriers to investment under existing rules in the \u201cStakeholder consultation \u2013 Synopsis report\u201d published in May. The results of the consultation confirmed that a number of respondents supported the EU manufacturing of solar panels as a way of ensuring that PV products installed in the EU apply high environmental standards, are\n\n(4) See: https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/public-consultation-feed-new-eu-strategy-solar-energy-2022-jan-18\nnot produced by forced labor and reinforcing supply chain resilience.\\(^5\\)\n\nIn addition, the EU Industrial Strategy published by the European Commission in Spring 2021 identifies solar as one of the key industrial ecosystems. The European supply chain will thus need to be strengthened in order to facilitate access to rapidly growing markets within the continent and globally. For detail on how we are acting to diversify the geographic footprint of the solar supply chain, please refer to \u201cClean electrification\u201d and \u201cOur commitment to a just transition: leaving no one behind\u201d.\n\n\\(^5\\) See: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13338-EU-solar-energy-strategy_en.\nAccess to remedy\n\nWe continuously monitor whether stakeholders are affected by our company\u2019s business operations, and if any impact is identified, we put in place remedial actions.\n\nWe ensure access to remedy through grievance mechanisms to enable people \u2014 inside or outside the company \u2014 to flag that there is an issue and to seek a meaningful response.\n\nGrievance mechanism\n\nIn line with the third Pillar of United Nations Guiding Principles, we have set up multiple channels of access to remedy, including:\n\n- a whistleblowing channel, available to internal and external stakeholders, through:\n  - the web or toll-free number shown on the Enel Code of Ethics web page;\n  - by writing to: Enel SpA - Audit Function - Code of Ethics. Via Dalmazia, 15 - 00198 Rome, Italy.\n- several processes and tools available to the communities in the influence area of our operations;\n- customers complaints or information channels (via mail, website, toll-free number).\n\nHereby, a summary description of how they work.\n\nWhistleblowing channel\n\nGrievances are managed following a specific process codified in the \u2018Management of anonymous and non-anonymous reports\u2019 policy, illustrated also in our Human Rights Policy, and summarized hereafter:\n\nSending a grievance\n\nAnalyzing a grievance\n\nActing upon an effective violation\n\nManagement and monitoring\n\nThe key elements of the mechanism are:\n\n- anonymity and protection against any form of retaliation;\n- protection against groundless allegations made maliciously to harm or cause prejudice to individuals;\n- uniformity of treatment at Group level, in compliance with company policies and local regulations.\n\nIdentity of stakeholders sending a grievance remains confidential, unless otherwise required by the law. Whenever, following a grievance, a violation of the principles contained in the Human Rights Policy is ascertained, the Audit function defines recommendations to implement the corrective actions. The relevant corporate functions thus define the actions to take in accordance with the applicable national legislation provisions.\n\nFurthermore, the Audit Function reports the above violations or any violation recorded during auditing activity as well as the ensuing necessary actions to:\n\n- the Control and Risks Committee, the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer of\nEnel SpA, who assess if the Board of Directors should be informed about the most significant cases:\n\n- the corporate bodies of directly or indirectly controlled subsidiaries for the issues of competence.\n\nAccess channels are both physical and digital. Moreover, there are also channels at local level and this ensures accessibility to all potentially affected stakeholders in their own language. For further detail, please refer to the chapter \u201cValues and pillars of corporate ethics\u201d.\n\nCommunities\n\nWe provide access channels for reporting by people who need to contact us, using the tools and means available locally, such as local teams or a specific person, toll-free numbers, or, in the case of isolated rural communities, local leaders who are available to periodically collect any complaints.\n\nCustomers\n\nCustomer complaints are managed through dedicated channels and analyzed by a specific working group so that the most suitable actions are taken, both insofar as to the specific matter of the complaint and, above all, in preventing the underlying causes that have led to the complaint.\n\nRedressing in legacy projects\n\nHereafter, an illustration of the actual(6) impacts relating to a few legacy projects.\n\nCHILE | BOCAMINA II\n\nActual adverse impact\nLand management and relocation.\n\nAffected stakeholders\nFamilies living in the area surrounding Bocamina\u2019s II unit which was adjacent to the first unit.\n\nBackground\nThe plant was part of the coal-fired thermoelectric complex of Bocamina, whose first unit (128 MW) shut down at the beginning of 2021.\n\nThe second unit (350 MW), shut down at the end of September 2022, was built in an area characterized by high urbanization and social vulnerability that generated impacts on the housing units around the construction site. With such closures, after the one involving the Tarapac\u00e1 plant in 2019, we have become the first power company in the country to stop using coal for its generation operations, 18 years ahead of the original 2040 goal set within Chile\u2019s 2019 National Decarbonization Plan and in line with our 2022-2024 Strategic Plan and our 2030 Vision, which place decarbonization and the acceleration of the energy transition at the core.\n\n(6) Impact occurred.\nRemedies identified\nOverview\nEngagement with the community has led to the development and the implementation of a broad series of initiatives for the social, economic and entrepreneurial development of the affected community, as well as an ambitious revegetation project to transform the 10-hectare area of the plant\u2019s ash landfill, which will no longer be used, into a native forest. In addition, in line with circular economy principles, we are studying various alternatives to reuse the facility\u2019s assets in order to provide new life to the site and create development opportunities for the area.\n\nAn extensive analysis was carried out in 2017 with the support of a company with considerable experience in this area to review how the original relocation process was carried out with the purpose of remediating any gap vs international existing standards.\n\nAmong the gaps that emerged as more evident are the inequality and partiality of the agreements previously reached both with the persons concerned and with local authorities, as well as the misalignment with international standards on resettlement.\n\nThe new plan involves approximately 1,400 families, most of them classified as belonging to vulnerable groups by the Ministry of Social Development.\n\nKey actions identified relate to:\n\na. preservation of the social and human capital of the communities;\n\nb. socio-economic development.\n\nKey lines of work\n\na. Preservation of the social and human capital of the communities:\n\ni. remedy construction defects of some of the new homes which were identified thanks to a joint technical committee involving Enel, the affected community and the Center of Investigation and Technologies of Construction (CITEC) - Universidad del B\u00edo B\u00edo;\n\nii. quantify and compensate the impacts on the quality of life of the families affected by construction defects and the impact associated to 12 churches which were not involved in the resettlement process;\n\niii. finance the reconstruction of the historical school in Coronel, \u201cRosa Medel\u201d as agreed with the town hall and with the community;\n\niv. requalify new and pre-existing areas adjacent to the plant through the:\n\n\u2022 building 12 community headquarters in various new neighborhoods;\n\n\u2022 painting of a 3,500 square meter mural \u2013 one of the largest in Chile \u2013 along the external perimeter of the Bocamina power plant, through the narration of the history of Coronel and its inhabitants (involving dozens of neighborhoods and organizations);\n\nv.

Through its strategic partnership with the OECD, B4IG interacts with governments around the world to promote inclusive growth.\nFor Enel people\n\nGlobally, there are 2,129 people with disabilities, of which over 70% in Italy. We make sure to listen to their needs thanks to \u201cfocal points\u201d present in all countries where at least one colleague with a disability is present. This allows us to develop dedicated initiatives both locally and globally, in line with our Human Rights and Diversity and Inclusion Policies. In particular, these initiatives allow to carry out work in complete autonomy, through tools, services and methodologies that can create an inclusive working and relational environment for all, and to raise awareness and train all people, with particular focus on specific roles more affected by these issues (new hires, managers, people & business partners, customer contact points).\n\nEmpowering initiatives include:\n\n\u2022 Global Inclusive Travel services to ensure an inclusive experience of stay and travel for business trips of colleagues with disabilities (for example, information on accessibility services in hotel facilities, activation of travel assistance service, travel accompanying services). 47% of colleagues can use at least one of the Inclusive Travel services;\n\u2022 participation in the Generation Valuable project promoted by the Valuable 500 network with the aim of spreading the culture of inclusion and empowerment of people with disabilities through mentoring meetings between talented colleagues with managers;\n\u2022 drawing of global guidelines to ensure adoption of accessibility principles for the development of e-learning content;\n\u2022 assistance and support for the adoption of assisting tools by a dedicated team in Italy;\n\u2022 \u201cAbility line\u201d service in Romania to support colleagues in recognizing disability;\n\u2022 initiatives to ensure physical and relational accessibility in Spain and Chile and to promote digital accessibility in Colombia;\n\u2022 hiring and internships of people with disabilities in Italy, Spain and Brazil, integration initiatives in collaboration with local institutions in Chile, Argentina and Mexico, inclusive staff research in collaboration with research and selection platforms in Romania, Argentina, Peru and Colombia;\n\u2022 pilot project, in Brazil, of tutoring in a process of on-boarding, listening and development in which more than 140 people with disabilities are participating and which involves about 100 managers and about 30 people and business partners.\n\nAwareness and training initiatives include:\n\n\u2022 design of an initiative at global level to spread awareness about the Design for all principles application to business processes and contexts so as to foster an inclusive mindset in Enel\u2019s people;\n\u2022 the videos \u201cOur ability\u201d, to learn everyday stories of colleagues with disabilities in their working environment, and the webinar \u201cNeurodiversity and autism\u201d on the value of neurodivergent thinking in Italy;\n\u2022 the online course \u201cHablamos de Discapacidad\u201d and the web fiction \u201cLa casa de la inclusi\u00f3n\u201d in Spain, subsequently customized for Romania, where podcasts on the inclusion of diversity and disability have also been developed, and the \u201cD&I hour\u201d when onboarding new hires;\n\u2022 workshops and thematic podcasts in Chile and Colombia, where all colleagues were also offered an induction on sign language.\n\nFor further detail, please refer to \u201cEmpowering Enel people\u201d\n\nFor our customers\n\nOne of the most innovative aspects of the Value4Disability project is inclusive business, namely the Group\u2019s commitment to opening new opportunities in terms of social innovation and business development starting from the solution of social needs. To promote this new approach in an integrated way, it is necessary to have a single vision of customer needs in terms of inclusiveness and accessibility.\n\nIn 2022 we have:\n\na. defined who vulnerable customers are and what are their needs.\n\n\u201cVulnerable customers, for Enel, are both individuals and entities who when looking at the combined effect of their intrinsic features, socio-demographic elements, economic and environmental conditions:\n\u2022 cannot participate or risk being adversely impacted by the energy market or by any of Enel Group\u2019s operations;\n\u2022 have difficulties in obtaining or using information to represent their interests;\n\u2022 are less comfortable accessing and using appropriate services and products.\n\nCustomers who are not directly vulnerable may fall under this definition if vulnerable people live in the same family and depend on family support or other assistance.\u201d\n\nBy focusing on temporary or permanent conditions, vulnerability results from the interaction between personal characteristics and changing environmental and socio-economic conditions.\n\nMoreover, the application of this definition is not limited to individuals, but is extended to all entities that\nmay be in a vulnerable position (for example, family small enterprises in which the owner dies, associations or businesses affected by economic situations such as earthquakes, floods, wars, financial crises). Therefore, social and economic vulnerability, disability, dependence on medical equipment, and other diversity aspects such as seniority, language, literacy, and any other feature that causes a certain degree of exclusion fall within the vulnerability definition;\n\nb. developed ad hoc initiatives to promote customer inclusion, thanks to intensive benchmarking and the support of business leaders and the contribution of internal communities of colleagues with disabilities. Here are some examples:\n\n- training course on vulnerable customers, dedicated to those who relate directly with customers;\n- guidelines for accessible and welcoming stores;\n- inclusive electrification process: we have launched a pilot project in Colombia to ensure that the electrification and contract signing phases are sustainable and inclusive. In particular, we are experimenting the application of the Social Inclusion Boosting Program involving the Social Inclusion Community, a selected group of people representing all the vulnerabilities typical of that context;\n\n- Enel Premia Wow! for All: project carried out as part of Enel Energia\u2019s loyalty program for the free market, aimed at the periodic inclusion in Enel Premia Wow! of discount coupons related to the theme of inclusion;\n\nc. involve our Business Lines in developing inclusive business initiatives.\n\nEnel X Way has, for example, made available in open source mode the redesign of spaces for charging electric vehicles to make them \u2018accessible\u2019 to anyone, from public administrations to other companies in the e-mobility sector. In addition, Enel X Way WayAbilityTM has been modified and updated: it is a product that makes it possible to recharge electric wheelchairs thanks to the public charging infrastructure in urban areas.\n\nFor our communities\n\nAs part of the sustainability projects planned in the area of influence of \u201cCoral\u201d in India, where we developed a wind farm of about 170 MW and, following the usual process of listening to local stakeholders, a grazing animal (a buffalo) for the production of milk was given to a member of the community in Gujarat, born with lower limb disability. By investing the earnings of milk sales in awareness raising and empowerment activities of people with disabilities in other villages, such person has become a natural leader, developing a network of about 450 individuals. In practice, such member of the community supports the network of women and men with disabilities in modifying their condition of marginality, which is considered non-productive, in a condition that supports the whole family.\n\nMoreover, vulnerable conditions are a source of stimulus and continuous social innovation. An example of these innovations is the sign language interpreting, subtitling and translation service, developed together with 2 startups (VEASYT and Pedius) that will be tested within the Group in 2023.\n\n(8) For example: gap in the use of technology, acting as caregivers, economic situations such as earthquakes, floods, wars, financial crises etc.\nBelow the 2022 results related to the targets of the previous 2022-2024 Sustainability Plan, the resulting progress and the targets of the 2023-2025 Sustainability Plan, which may be redefined, added to, or surpassed with respect to the previous Plan.\n\n| SDG | Activities | 2022 results | Progress | 2023-2025 targets | Tag |\n|-----|------------|--------------|----------|-------------------|-----|\n| 8   | Safety Extra Checking on Site (ECoS) | 124 Safety ECoS carried out | \u2b24 \u2b24 \u2b24 | 80 Safety ECoS in 2025 | S   |\n| 8   | Safety Contractor Assessments | 1,134 Safety Contractor Assessments carried out | \u2b24 \u2b24 \u2b24 | | S   |\n|     | Target outdated as it was substituted with the target on proactive Evaluation Groups, both related to checks activities on contractors supplier control activities | | | | |\n| 8   | Evaluation Group (EG) proactive towards contractors | N.A. | N.A. | 47 in 2025 | S   |\n| 8   | Reduction of injury frequency rates compared to prior years (LTIFR) | -23% vs 2021 (LTIFR = 0.50)\\(^{(1)}\\) | \u2b24 \u2b24 \u2b24 | -1% compared to the previous year | S   |\n| 8   | Training hours provided by SHE Factory | 65,304 hours | \u2b24 \u2b24 \u2b24 | | S   |\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) This figure is the result of the calculation made using unrounded decimal values and refers to the combined LTIFR, Enel people and contractors.

As part of the wider commitment to respect of human rights, in fact, we are committed to developing and promoting a robust safety culture in order to guarantee a workplace that is free from health and safety hazards for everyone who works with and for the Group.\n\nThe constant commitment of all, integration of safety in processes and in training activities, disclosure and analysis of events, rigorous selection and management of contractor companies, continuous quality controls, sharing of experience and benchmarking with the top international players are the foundational elements of our safety culture.\n\nThe protection of health and safety is the responsibility of everyone who works for Enel. The Stop Work Policy requires that both company employees as well as personnel of contractor companies are asked to intervene promptly and stop work that could endanger their own safety and health as well as the safety and health of others, or that could harm the environment, understood as compromising the quality of its components. The Stop Work order is applied without consequences. No fault or responsibility will be attributed to an employee or contractor who signals a risky situation in good faith.\n\n2.25\nTOTAL RECORDABLE INJURY FREQUENCY RATE (TRI FR) ENEL AND COMPANIES COMBINED\n2.86 in 2021 -21.3%\n\n217\nEXTRA CHECKING ON SITE (ECoS) SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT\n279 in 2021 -22.2%\n\n0.50\nLOST TIME INJURY FREQUENCY RATE (LTI FR) ENEL AND COMPANIES COMBINED\n0.65 in 2021 -23.1%\n\n1,245 thousand hours\nOF TOTAL TRAINING FOR ENEL PEOPLE\n1,188 thousand hours +4.7%\nThe \u201cStatement of Commitment to Health and Safety\u201d and the \u201cStop Work Policy\u201d, both signed by the Chief Executive Officer, are two documents on which the commitment of our Group is based, also as approved by our Policy on human rights. The Statement of Commitment is based on the following principles:\n\n- compliance with legislation, adoption of the best standards and sharing of experience;\n- creation, implementation and continual improvement of the Occupational Health and Safety Management System in compliance with international standard ISO 45001;\n- reduction of injuries, occupational diseases and other accidental events through the implementation of suitable preventive measures and checking of their adequacy and effectiveness;\n- assessment of all health and safety risks and adoption of a systematic approach to eliminate them at the source if possible, or to minimize them, while guaranteeing maximum protection for anyone working for Enel;\n- promotion of informative initiatives to disseminate and consolidate a culture of good health, safety and organizational well-being;\n- adoption of working methods inspired by quality and their dissemination by means of incisive and effective training that aims to create a lasting connection between technical aspects and safety aspects;\n- direct commitment of the persons in charge aimed at strengthening a robust culture of leadership in relation to safety;\n- adoption of safe and responsible conduct throughout all levels of the organization;\n- design of workplaces and supply of suitable equipment and tools for the execution of operating activities, guaranteeing optimal and the safest conditions;\n- rigorous selection and management of contractors and vendors, promoting their involvement in safety performance continual improvement programs;\n- constant attention towards communities and towards all those who work with or come into contact with the Group\u2019s activities by sharing a culture of health and safety protection;\n- annual definition of priorities, specific and measurable goals and continual monitoring to check their effective implementation through the involvement of Top Management.\n\nThe health and safety system\n\nIn line with the Policy on Human Rights, Code of Ethics, Statement of Commitment and Stop Work Policy, we have defined a specific Health & Safety Policy that requires every Group Business Line to have its own Health & Safety Management System in compliance with international standard ISO 45001. The Management System is based on the identification of hazards, the qualitative and quantitative assessment of the risks, the planning and implementation of the preventive and protective measures, as well as checking their effectiveness, any corrective measures and the preparation of work teams. The Management System involves both Enel people and personnel from contractor companies who work at Enel\u2019s plants and sites, and is based on the following shared principles:\n\n- prior evaluation, elimination and/or reduction of risks through application of the latest technical know-how;\n- identification of the necessary preventive measures and the associated implementation program;\n- adoption of residual risk mitigation measures, awarding priority to collective rather than personal solutions;\n- active, responsible and integrated intervention of all parties concerned with safety, involving workers and/or workers\u2019 representatives, starting from the identification of risk situations up to the choice of solutions to prevent and/or reduce them;\n- appointment of a medical officer, when required, and setting up health surveillance for workers responsible for specific high-risk processes;\n- preparation of a program of information and training of workers in order to increase awareness when dealing with situations of risk;\n- regular upkeep and cleaning of workplaces;\n- the adoption of tools, also technological tools, to support the assessment of the risk and its resulting mitigation.\nThe Holding Health, Safety, Environment and Quality unit (HSEQ) performs the roles of supervision, guidance and coordination, promoting the dissemination and sharing of best practices within the Group and external health and safety benchmarking with top international players in order to identify improvement opportunities and ensure constant commitment in the area of risk reduction. The Global Business Lines and Country HSEQ structures orient and support the business in relation to health and safety issues, define improvement plans and monitor their execution.\n\nEnel\u2019s commitment is: zero injuries every day, all days\n\nCombined values, Enel people and contractors\n\n| Total Recordable Injuries (TRI) no. | Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRI FR) |\n|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| 1,308 1,212 962                    | 3.24 2.86 2.25                                |\n| 2020 2021 2022                     | 2020 2021 2022                                |\n| -20.6%                             | -21.3%                                        |\n\n| Number of Fatal Accidents (FAT) no. | Fatality Frequency Rate (FAT FR) |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 9 9 6                               | 0.022 0.021 0.014                |\n| 2020 2021 2022                      | 2020 2021 2022                   |\n| -33.3%                              | -33.3%                           |\n\n| Number of Life Changing Accidents (LCA) no. | Life Changing Accidents Frequency Rate (LCA FR) |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| 4 2 0                                       | 0.009 0.005                                  |\n| 2020 2021 2022                              | 2020 2021 2022                              |\n| -50.0%                                      | -44.4%                                       |\nAs compared to the previous year, in 2022 there was a consistent reduction in all injury frequency rates, in relation to a number of hours worked that has remained more or less constant (+1.1%).\n\nIn 2022, the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRI FR) decreased 21.3% compared to 2021, with approximately 2.2 injury events for every million hours worked. This decrease involves both Enel people (-2.4%) as well as personnel from contractor companies (-24.4%). Furthermore, as regards events with the highest impact, there were 6 fatalities involving 1 employee of the Group (Enel Grids in Romania) and 5 involving contractors (all in Enel Grids, 3 in Brazil, 1 in Italy and 1 in Argentina). The causes of all these injuries are mainly associated with electrical (5) and mechanical (1) related accidents. Furthermore, during the year there was only 1 Life Changing injury that involved a Grids contractor in Brazil.\n\nThere were also 2 Life Changing injuries, that is injuries with consequences that changed the life of the injured person, one from Grids in Brazil and the other Enel X in Chile, both contracting company personnel.\n\n217 Extra Checking on Site (ECoS) assessments were performed in 2022, meaning the internal assessment of safety and environment in order to evaluate the suitability of the organization and processes in a specific operating area of the Group. These checks are performed by expert HSEQ personnel who come from outside the operating unit under assessment, in addition to technical profiles who are specific to the business. After the check is performed, a report is issued with the evidence found in the field and the proposed corrective measures, whose implementation is monitored until complete conclusion.\n\nAs regards the collection, analysis and management of the events, the Group uses Policy 106 \u201cClassification, communication, analysis and reporting of incidents\u201d, which defines roles and methods employed to guarantee prompt communication of incidents, ensuring the related cause analysis process, definition of improvement plans, and monitoring of the associated actions depending on the event type. Based on evidence resulting from the monitoring and control system, a data-driven approach was implemented that is based on IT tools and analytical dashboards, which makes it possible to appraise the performance of the organizational units and suppliers, identify areas at greater risk of fatalities and Life Changing injuries and the subsequent management methods. This approach is combined with the collection and sharing of the best practices that support the process of continuous learning and help avoid the same events from repeating.\n\nSafety in contract processes\n\nSafety at Enel is integrated in tender processes and the performance of companies is monitored both on a preliminary level, by means of the qualification system, and during contract execution through a large number of control processes and tools such as the Supplier Performance Management tool (SPM).\n\nDuring the tender phase, a specific document is prepared (\u201cHSE Terms\u201d), and attached to all contracts that must be signed by contractors when work is awarded. The document, which is the same throughout the entire Group, defines the obligations in relation to health, safety and environmental aspects that the contractors must respect, placing the same obligation on their subcontractors. This tool clarifies Enel\u2019s requirements and conveys their importance to contractors; it also defines a list of safety and environmental violations that can involve specific penalties, up to the termination of the contract and/or suspension of qualification on the Enel supplier portal.\n\nAs regards supplier safety and environmental checks, during 2022 the performance of the Contractor Assessment (CA), continued at the offices of the suppliers and at their job sites, or also remotely when it was not possible to visit them on site. 1,434 CA were carried out distributed among all the Enel Business Lines and Countries and Regions. The Contractor Assessment is carried out during the qualification phase for each new supplier, in cases in which criticalities emerge (severe injuries or fatalities) or low SPM (Supplier Performance Management) rating scores. In addition, 55 Evaluation Groups (EG), which are periodic multidisciplinary meetings, were held in 2022 distributed in all the Business Lines and Countries and Regions, which make it possible to assess the safety performance of suppliers and define targeted actions as well as accompaniment and support plans customized for the companies, in order to reach the desired safety standards and mitigate possible areas of risk in advance.\nInfrastructure safety and technological innovation\n\nEnel views technological innovation as a valid tool capable of improving a large number of processes from the Health & Safety perspective. In continuation with what was done in previous years, the development and application of some innovative safety and health projects were continued also in 2022.\n\n\u201cPersonal Voltage Detectors\u201d, portable devices designed to identify electrical voltage on medium-voltage power lines located at operationally significant distances from the worker but not necessarily involved in the activity in progress, are being used in the Infrastructure and Networks area to reduce the electrical risk.\n\nWithin the scope of the \u201cIntrinsic Safety\u201d program, which was implemented with synergy and co-design between various Enel Global Business Lines and Holding Functions, many experiments and innovative projects are being developed, such as: \u201cAI4Lifting\u201d, which uses Artificial Intelligence to detect any potential situations of danger when handling loads, and \u201cHop Safe\u201d, a system that allows personnel to use a ladder when working at a height only when they are properly connected to the life line.\n\nThe experimentation of innovative solutions is being continued in the area of HMI (Human-Machine Interaction) to prevent the risk of accidental impacts with moving work equipment or with underground service lines, as in the case of the following projects:\n\n- **Anticollision System**: whose objective is to improve the functionality of devices that generate alarms through the use of Artificial Intelligence programs;\n- **Smart Bucket**: which implements a system that is able to prevent damaging underground utilities during excavation works, which are a significant market problem that can create construction delays and risks for the safety of machine operators;\n- **AME**: a project with the purpose of creating a device able to define a safe work area dedicated to operators and vehicles, through the use of proximity and voltage presence sensors.\n\nFinally, innovative solutions are being developed for monitoring health conditions during work activities in order to prevent and quickly manage potential situations of danger and/or emergency. An example is **Safety 4 Lone workers** which involves the use of a multifunctional device (smart-watch) that uses specific algorithms to monitor the main biometric parameters in order to prevent possible situations of risk, in particular for Enel workers working alone.\n\nIn parallel, 2022 marked the end of the test campaign for the **Youcare T-shirt**, an innovative wearable proposed by the \u201cAccyourate\u201d company, which was fitted with electro-medical sensors that detect up to 9 bio-vital parameters, whose positive result opens up further scenarios in the area of injury prevention and in the planning of campaigns for data driven based health.\n\nHealth\n\nHealth is a fundamental value for the care and development of our people. For this reason, the Enel Group has adopted a structured health management system based on preventive and protection measures, and is committed to developing a corporate culture oriented toward the promotion of psychological-physical health, organizational well-being and balance between the professional and personal spheres.\n\nThis approach is described in the Policy on Human Rights and the new version of the \u201cHealth and Well-being\u201d Policy, approved in January 2022, and defines in three main steps \u2013 health surveillance, prevention and well-being \u2013 the path for promoting good health and well-being.\n\nFrom this point of view, from a global and local perspective, we are promoting initiatives targeted toward improving the quality of the work day on a physical and psychological level, and are implementing awareness campaigns for promoting healthy lifestyles. For example, in 2022, a global campaign on health risks connected to smoking was carried out, and 2 webinars were held, translated into the main languages of the Group Countries and available to all employees that explained the effects of smoking on health and provided advice on how to quit.\n\nAs regards work-correlated stress, over the past years we have carried out 3 surveys, starting from a coverage of approximately 20% up to all employees. The last survey was started at the end of 2022. These surveys did not point out true work-correlated stress, but some Company areas emerged with a greater number of \u201cborderline\u201d cases, for which we planned and implemented actions to reduce the average stress level of the unit.\n\nAs regards occupational diseases, our analyses did not\nfind cases related to renewable energies that, due to their nature, decrease the risk caused by the greater speed of building the plants and their more simple management. In addition, we are providing screening programs targeted toward preventing the onset of diseases and offer conventions that provide ready access to medical and healthcare services, assistance actions for persons with disabilities and specific preventive medicine initiatives. As regards business travel, the \u201cHealth, safety and emergency aspects for expats or long term travelers\u201d policy is in force, which in addition to providing guidelines to travelers in terms of health, safety and emergency management, also defines in a uniform manner the preliminary steps and authorization flow for the temporary assignment of Enel people abroad. For the latter and their families, insurance coverage was activated since last year, which provides access to health care services in the host country, as well as home care.\n\nDevelopment of safety culture: training and information\n\nTo support the processes of change and guarantee the dissemination of a solid safety culture on all levels, the Enel Group has a structured process for the management and provision of training to all employees. Overall in 2022, Enel people received approximately 1,245 thousand training hours regarding health and safety, with the purpose of protecting the health and psychological-physical well-being of people and increasing the know-how and specific skills of workers throughout the Group. In particular, in the Holding HSEQ organizational unit, the SHE Factory unit is active, which has the specific objective of implementing, integrating and harmonizing training projects throughout the entire Group dedicated to promoting a new mentality for a better way to work that is safer for people and more sustainable for the environment. SHE Factory unit provided more than 65 thousand hours of internal training.\n\nIn 2022, this unit provided various specific training courses on health, safety, environment and quality (HSEQ), which involved approximately 18 thousand employees, for a total of more than 65 thousand hours of training supplied. As regards safety, the main topics that were addressed last year were Safety Leadership, Stop Work Policy, Buddy Partner and Mentor.\n\nThe Buddy Mentors can be defined as \u201csafety influencers\u201d and are based on a fundamental assumption: \u201cWorking safely means ensuring the safe work also of your buddies\u201d. This is a project characterized by innovation, change (cultural and organizational), transferability and effectiveness of the results. With this initiative targeted toward Enel Grids personnel, Enel won the \u201cAIF Training Excellence Award (Italian Trainer Association)\u201d in Italy, in the category \u201cHealth, Safety, Organizational Well-being\u201d, targeted toward all professional structures working in the public or private sector.\n\nParticular attention is also placed on suppliers with the \u201cPartnership for safety, health and the environment\u201d project, which focuses on assisting Enel partners in adapting their company standards regarding HSEQ, with assessments and collaboration opportunities in the field. From this point of view, SHE Factory provided all suppliers with a global software platform, ENEL4SHARE Platform, for the sharing of training material which can be downloaded and used by the supplier to hold training for their employees.\nHEALTH WEBINAR \u2013 The importance of prevention: risks to health deriving from smoking cigarettes\n\nWe are committed to developing a corporate culture oriented toward the promotion of psychological-physical health, organizational well-being and balance between the professional and personal spheres.\n\n\u201cFor Enel, worker good health and well-being have always been a top priority. We are working to protect the psychological and physical well-being of all our colleagues, not only at work, but also at home and during their free time. For this reason, we are committed to promoting healthy life styles and developing a new well-being-oriented corporate culture. We are convinced that our contribution is able to improve the lives of our colleagues and their loved ones, and this motivates us to always do better.\u201d\n\nCigarette smoking is one of the main causes of disease and death world-wide. Fortunately, many of the negative effects of smoking can be prevented or reduced by quitting smoking. It does not matter how long you have smoked, quitting can still considerably reduce the risk of developing diseases associated with smoking.\n\nThe Health and Safety unit of HSEQ Holding, organized a global awareness event on damage caused by smoking on May 31, on occasion of the \u201cWorld No Tobacco Day\u201d.\n\nWith Professor Laura Carrozzi, Full Professor of Respiratory System Diseases at the University of Pisa, and Director of the AOUP Pneumology Unit, and Dr. Francesco Pistelli, Senior Researcher of Respiratory System Diseases at the University of Pisa and Manager of CEST, \u201cCenter for the Study and Treatment of Tobacco Use\u201d, we discussed prevention, the health benefits that result from deciding to stop smoking, products that replace the traditional cigarette, how the pandemic changed smoking habits and the environmental impact of smoking.\n\nThe webinar, which is also available in on-demand mode, has been translated into the main languages of the Group and recorded the participation of approximately 3,600 people, equal to approximately 5% of all Group employees.\nSafety of communities and third parties\n\nEstablishing solid and long-lasting relations with local communities in the countries in which Enel operates represents a fundamental pillar of the Group\u2019s strategy. This, together with constant attention to social and environmental factors, makes it possible for Enel to implement on the one hand a new fair development model that does not leave anyone behind and on the other hand is able to create shared value over the long term for all stakeholders.\n\nOur installed plants are built in compliance with legislative prescriptions and the rules of best technical practice. Plants, machines and work equipment are subject to systematic and periodic checks and maintenance activities to guarantee correct operation in compliance with regulations and in accordance with the adoption of the best safety standards.\n\nIn order to guarantee the health and safety of the community and reduce the impact of the typical activities of the Company\u2019s generation process on the external environment, the Company carries out monitoring campaigns. These include, for example, measurement of the electromagnetic fields of power networks, the detection of the noise level, vibration and dust created by the electrical machines of power plants and distribution and transformer substations. Also the following environmentally significant factors are monitored: atmospheric emissions and air quality, effluent discharge into surface waters, water quality, production, reuse and disposal of waste, soil quality, biodiversity impacts.\n\nConsiderable attention has been devoted to preventing injuries involving members of the public who accidentally come into contact with electricity networks during operations such as job sites near transmission lines or sports and leisure pursuits (fishing, flying kites, etc.). For this reason, awareness campaigns are conducted periodically, addressed both to the general public and to specific categories such as, for example, construction companies and sport\u2019s associations.\n\nEmergencies management\n\nOur Group has defined a common crisis and critical events management system across the various countries where we are present, described by policy 24 \u201cCritical Event Management\u201d. This system involves evaluation of the impact caused by critical events by means of a standard reference scale with three levels. High-impact crises are managed centrally, while medium- or low-impact crisis situations are managed within the specific organization in the individual countries.\n\nHigh-impact crises (\u201cGroup Red Code\u201d) are also addressed by creating a central crisis committee in the Security Control Room at the Viale Regina Margherita headquarters in Rome, supplying support 24/7 for communication and coordination of information flows. Moreover, the crisis committee defines strategies and actions to deal with critical events and coordinates all actions designed to restrict damage to the Enel Group\u2019s property, profitability and reputation.\n\nIn parallel, if the critical event can involve risks to the health and safety of people, the policy 203 \u201cGuideline for Emergency Management\u201d foresees on a global level the immediate activation of emergency measures, in compliance with the locally adopted safety management systems.\n\nNuclear policy\n\nIn the context of its operations in the field of nuclear technologies, Enel has made a public commitment, in the role of shareholder, to guarantee that a clear nuclear safety policy is adopted in its atomic energy plants and that the plants are managed in accordance with criteria capable of assuring the absolute priority of safety and protection of workers, the community and the environment.\n\nFurther details are available on the Enel website (https://www.enel.com/it/investitori/sostenibilita/impegno-quotidiano/salute-sicurezza-lavoro/enel-nucleare).\nIndustrial relations on health and safety topics\n\nIn order to consolidate the culture of safety and promote the adoption of behaviors that are consistent with Company policies, Enel supports social dialogue and participation of workers\u2019 representatives. Joint committees have been set up for this purpose in the main countries in which Enel is present, dedicated to monitoring the issues and projects concerning workers\u2019 health and safety on the national level and also in terms of Business Lines. In Italy, in implementation of the matters provided for by the national trade union agreement on the \u201cItalian model of Enel Italia industrial relations\u201d, there has been a bilateral commission on workplace safety and protection policies in force since 2012. The commission examines the main projects aimed at improving safety standards, training projects, preventive initiatives. In 2013, the Enel Global Framework Agreement created an analogous bilateral commission at the Group level, which defined a \u201cjoint recommendation\u201d concerning health and safety standards applicable in all Enel countries. Negotiations are in progress to renew the Enel Global Framework Agreement.\n\nOn March 29, 2022, Enel and the trade unions signed the \u201cCharter of the Person\u201d, which is a document containing important principles also concerning the safety culture and behaviors that are being implemented on a Group level, as the agreement was implemented also in other Countries and Regions.\n\nThe following details concern the commissions that operate in the main countries on the national and/or local levels.\n\n| COUNTRY | JOINT COMMITTEES FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY |\n|---------|----------------------------------------|\n| Italy   | The Occupational Safety and Environment Policies Committee performs an important role of analysis and planning of projects that concern safety, the processing of prevention policies and organizational solutions, promotion of safety training courses for personnel and employees of contractor companies, with particular attention to the prevention and protection service manager. The Health and Safety Bilateral Bodies per Business Area are responsible, in particular in the Grids area that follows the guidelines dictated by the Bilateral Committee, applying them to the specific context of the Grids, for analyzing the injury trend, suggesting innovative safety projects, analyzing training plans and modify operating instructions. During the last two years, both the Committee as well as the Health and Safety Bilateral Bodies were particularly active, with periodic meetings almost every 15 days, in order to review in particular all the aspects correlated to the pandemic, as well as for the management of safety issues in order to identify and accompany innovative projects targeted towards continuously improving the prevention of injuries, but above all to work on the safety culture also as specified in the Charter of the Person. |\n| Romania | In compliance with legislative provisions, there is an Occupational Health and Safety Committee comprised of representatives appointed by the trade organizations who represent the workers for each company (worker representatives) on the one hand, and on the other, a number of people representing the employer equal to the number of worker representatives. The occupational health physician is required to participate in the CSSM meetings. The Occupational Safety and Health Committee aims to guarantee employee involvement in the development and implementation of decisions regarding occupational health and safety. Committee members meet periodically (every three months and each time it is necessary) to discuss specific problems and propose measures/actions for managing, controlling and improving the level of employee health and safety. Based on the CLA, every Enel company also has joint committees comprised of representatives of the members of the company and union/worker representatives that meet periodically/every time it is necessary to resolve problems that arrive when applying the valid CLA, as well as to create an organizational framework that permits them to remain in permanent contact in order to prepare the negotiations for the new CLA. |\n| Spain   | The Comisi\u00f3n de participaci\u00f3n y control has been set up on the national level, while the local level is handled by Comit\u00e9s de seguridad y salud territoriales. |\n| Argentina | The power plants have bilateral committees responsible for health and hygiene issues, which meet once a month or once every two months. The agreement does not specify the frequency with which the meetings are held. |\n| Chile   | The mixed health and safety committees are active and have the task of avoiding occupational injuries by implementing measures for the prevention of risks for employers, implementing permanent work and programs on the safety of work places. |\n| Peru    | We have bilateral committees (workers and Company representatives) that approve occupational health and safety policies according to law. |\n| Brazil  | The Comiss\u00e3o interna de preven\u00e7\u00e3o de acidentes has been established at all sites, which is comprised of Company representatives and worker representatives; the committee focuses on the creation of injury prevention initiatives. |\n| Colombia | Two joint committees have been set up (COPASST), one for networks and one for generation, with the role of promoting occupational medicine legislation. |\n| Mexico  | The Health and Safety committee is active: as required by law, there is a Mixed Commission for Safety and Hygiene (MCSH) for each plant, including also the corporate offices. This represents the obligations of the employer according to \u201cNOM-019-STPS-2011\u201d (constitution, integration, organization and operation of the safety and hygiene commissions), being a bipartisan body comprised of an equal number of worker and employer representatives, whose purpose is to identify hazardous and unsafe agents and conditions, investigate the causes of occupational injuries and illnesses; suggest measures for preventing them, and to control observance. The personnel part of the Mixed Commission for Safety and Hygiene (MCSH) perform a safety walk at each plant and site every three months. |\nBelow the 2022 results related to the targets of the previous 2022-2024 Sustainability Plan, the resulting progress and the targets of the 2023-2025 Sustainability Plan, which may be redefined, added to, or surpassed with respect to the previous Plan.\n\n| SDG | Activities | 2022 results | Progress | 2023-2025 targets | Tag |\n|-----|------------|--------------|----------|-------------------|-----|\n| 16  | Diversity Policy -

Notably, the shareholder structure at December 31, 2022 was as follows: (i) 56.7% institutional investors; (ii) 19.7% retail investors; (iii) 23.6% Ministry of the Economy and Finance. Enel\u2019s corporate structure includes the main international investment funds, insurance companies, pension funds and ethical funds, thanks also to the adoption, by the Company and the Group, of the best international practices on transparency and corporate governance. Moreover, at the date of this Sustainability Report, the Enel Group includes a further 11 companies issuing shares listed on the Brazilian, Chilean, Peruvian, Spanish, and US Stock Exchanges.\nPolicy for managing the dialog with institutional investors and with all shareholders and bondholders\n\nEnel considers it to be in its specific interest \u2013 as well as a duty toward the market \u2013 to ensure a constant and open relationship that is based on the mutual understanding of the roles with all shareholders and bondholders, as well as with the institutional investors and their representative associations in order to increase the relative level of understanding regarding the activities performed by the Company and the Group. In this context, Enel maintains dialogue with counterparties based on principles of fairness and transparency, in compliance with EU and national regulations on market abuse, as well as in line with international best practices. This engagement activity has led to the positive result, over recent years, of a significant increase in participation of the institutional investors in the Shareholders\u2019 Meetings.\n\nIn order to regulate the methods for developing this dialog, in March 2021 the Board of Directors adopted a specific Policy, (i.e. \u201cEngagement Policy\u201d), acting on a proposal of the Chairman made in agreement with the Chief Executive Officer, which clarified to a large extent the practices already followed by Enel and whose use takes into account the applicable best practices adopted by the institutional investors and reflected in the stewardship codes. This Engagement Policy, which was applied consistently during 2022, also identifies the corporate structures that, in line with the practices established by Enel from the moment their shares were listed on the stock exchange, are responsible for the dialog activities, and specifically with: (i) a specific Investor Relations office which is part of the Administration, Finance and Control Function, which interacts on a continuous basis with the institutional investors (as well as with the financial analysts and the rating agencies); as well as (ii) a specific area in the Corporate Affairs office, which is in turn part of the Legal and Corporate Affairs Function, which interacts on a continuous basis with the retail shareholders and bondholders, providing them with all useful explanations regarding the respective issues of interest. The information provided to Enel\u2019s institutional investors and all their shareholders and bondholders by the above-indicated organizational structures \u2013 as well as by any other duly authorized Company member \u2013 complies with the criteria of truthfulness, clarity, coherence, completeness and symmetry of information; the information is also supplied in a timely manner and in compliance with what is required by the regulation adopted by Enel regarding the processing of corporate information.\n\nIn particular, the Investor Relations structures are, for example, responsible for the following: (i) preparing Enel\u2019s equity story and organizing meetings between the Company\u2019s Top Management and the financial community; (ii) managing relationships with ratings agencies and with the fixed income investors; (iii) managing relationships with institutional investors and financial analysts; (iv) coordinating the management of relationships with the institutional investors who have an interest in the listed share capital controlled by Enel; (v) preparing market analyses and reports concerning Enel shares, also monitoring the consensus of the financial analysts; (vi) supporting the Communications Function, in coordination with the Corporate Affairs unit with the definition and approval of Enel\u2019s price sensitive press releases, as well as developing and updating the content dedicated to investors on the Company website and in the app called \u201cEnel Investor\u201d.\n\nFor more details, refer to the Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structure for 2022. Also, Enel\u2019s website (www.enel.com, \u201cInvestors\u201d section) provides access to economic, financial, environmental, social and governance information and updated data and documents of particular interest, providing a multidisciplinary and integrated vision.\nEnel\u2019s corporate governance system complies with the principles contained in the Italian Corporate Governance Code published on January 31, 2020 (the \u201cCorporate Governance code\u201d), to which the Company adheres, was also inspired by the international best practices. The corporate governance system adopted by Enel is oriented toward the goal of sustainable success, given that it is aimed at creating value for shareholders over the long term, aware of the importance from an environmental and social point of view of the Enel Group\u2019s operating activities and the consequent need to proceed with adequate consideration of all the interests of the relevant stakeholders.\n\nFor a detailed illustration of Enel\u2019s corporate governance, we invite you to refer to the Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structure for 2022, which is available on the Company\u2019s website (www.enel.com); we further refer you to the specific sections of this Sustainability Report for an illustration of the governance of sustainability and the management of climate change.\n\n---\n\n(1) It is available on the Borsa Italiana website (at https://www.borsaitaliana.it/comitato-corporate-governance/codice/2020.pdf).\n2022\n\nCOMPOSITION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n1 executive director\n1 in 2021\n\n8 non-executive directors\n8 in 2021\nof which 8 independent\\(^{(1)}\\)\n8 in 2021\n\n4 Women\n4 in 2021\n\n5 Men\n5 in 2021\n\n0% < 30\n\n11% 30-50\n\n89% > 50\n\nEXPERTISE\n\nEnergy industry\n\nLegal and corporate governance\n\nStrategic vision\n\nCommunication and marketing\n\nAccounting, finance and risk management\n\nInternational experience\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) The figures for 2022 and 2021 refer to directors qualifying as independent pursuant to the Consolidated Law on Financial Intermediation and the Italian Corporate Governance Code (2020 edition).\nThe Board of Directors in office was appointed by the Ordinary Shareholders\u2019 Meeting of May 14, 2020 and consists of nine members. Enel applies diversity criteria, also in relation to gender, in the composition of the Board of Directors, in line with the priority goal of ensuring adequate competence and professionalism of its members. Specifically, in January 2018 the Board of Directors, acting on a proposal of the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee and the Nomination and Compensation Committee, and in implementation of what is required by the Single Financial Act, approved a diversity policy that describes the optimal characteristics of the Board\u2019s composition to ensure it can fulfil its duties as effectively as possible, making decisions that can tangibly benefit from the contribution of a plurality of different qualified members able to examine the issues under discussion from diverse perspectives.\n\nThe Board of Directors held 16 meetings in 2022, of which 12 addressed climate-related matters, reflected in the strategies and related implementation methods. In order to provide Directors with an adequate overview of the business sectors in which the Group operates (including sustainability issues), a broad and comprehensive induction program was organized commencing in the second half of 2020, followed by specific examination of the topics of corporate governance and climate change during 2021. During 2022, the induction program continued with further examination of the topics of cyber security and risk governance.\n\nThe maximum number of offices that the members of the Board of Directors can hold on the Board of Directors or governing bodies of other companies of a relevant size is regulated by a specific corporate policy, which was last updated in 2020 in order to adapt the contents to the relevant best practices prepared by the main proxy advisors and relevant institutional investors.\n\nIn order to regulate the way in which the Company engages with institutional investors and with all shareholders and bond holders, in March 2021 the Board of Directors adopted a specific Policy (i.e. \u201cEngagement Policy\u201d), acting on a proposal of the Chairman formulated in agreement with the Chief Executive Officer, which clarified to a large extent the practices already followed by Enel and whose use takes into account the applicable best practices adopted by the institutional investors and reflected in the \u201cstewardship\u201d codes.\n\nIn relation to the topic of succession plans for executive directors, in September 2016 the Board of Directors, acting on a proposal of the Nomination and Compensation Committee made in agreement with the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, shared the contents of a specific \u201ccontingency plan\u201d aimed at regulating the steps to be taken to assure proper management of the Company in case the Chief Executive Officer ceases to hold office before the end of their ordinary term (defined as \u201ccrisis management\u201d cases).\n\nFinally, at the end of 2022 and during the first months of 2023, with the assistance of an independent consultant, the Board of Directors carried out an assessment of the size, composition, and functioning of the Board itself and its committees (i.e. \u201cboard review\u201d), in line with the most advanced corporate governance practices followed internationally and assimilated in the Corporate Governance Code. The board review was conducted also in accordance with the peer-to-peer review method, i.e. through assessment not merely of the operation of the body considered globally, but also of the style and contents of the contribution provided by each of its members, and was extended to the Board of Statutory Auditors. Within the scope of the board review, specific attention was dedicated to verify the Directors\u2019 perception regarding (i) the effectiveness of the induction activities, as well as (ii) the involvement of the Board of Directors in sustainability issues and the integration of sustainability topics in corporate strategy, including those related to climate change. The results of the board review are provided in Enel\u2019s Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structure.\n\nRemuneration policy\n\nEnel\u2019s Remuneration Policy for 2022, which was adopted by the Board of Directors acting on a proposal of the Nomination and Compensation Committee and approved by the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting of May 19, 2022, was defined in consideration of (i) the recommendations contained in the Italian Corporate Governance Code, published on January 31, 2020; (ii) the national and international best practices; (iii) the information that emerged from the favorable vote of the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting of May 20, 2021 on the remuneration policy for 2021; (iv) the results of the engagement activities regarding corporate governance carried out by the Company between January\nand March 2022 with the main proxy advisors and some relevant institutional investors with an interest in Enel capital; (iv) the results of a benchmark analysis regarding the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer/General Manager and the Non-Executive Directors of Enel for 2021, which was prepared by the independent consultant Mercer.\n\nThe purpose of this Policy is to (i) promote Enel\u2019s sustainable success, which is based on the creation of long-term value to the benefit of its shareholders, taking into due consideration the interests of the other relevant stakeholders, in order to encourage reaching the strategic goals; (ii) attract, retain and motivate people with the skills and professionalism required for the delicate managerial tasks assigned to them, in consideration of the compensation and work conditions of the Company and Enel Group employees; as well as (iii) promote the company mission and values.\n\nThe remuneration policy for 2022 sets out the following compensation for the Chief Executive Officer/General Manager and for Key Management Personnel (referred to as DRS \u2013 Dirigenti con Responsabilit\u00e0 Strategiche):\n\n- a fixed component;\n- a short-term variable component (MBO), to be paid based on the achievement of specific performance targets. Specifically:\n  - for the Chief Executive Officer/General Manager, the 2022 MBO is based on the following annual performance targets:\n    - Ordinary consolidated net income;\n    - Group Opex;\n    - Funds from operations/Consolidated net financial debt;\n    - System Average Interruption Duration Index \u2013 SAIDI (gateway objective), commercial complaints on the free commodities market in Italy (gateway objective) and commercial complaints on a Group level;\n    - Safety in the workplace;\n  - for the DRS, the respective MBO identify the annual objectives and specific objectives correlated to the Strategic Plan and identified together with the Administration, Finance and Control Function and by the People and Organization Function;\n- a long-term variable component linked to participation in specific multi-annual incentive plans. In particular, for 2022 this component is linked to participation in the Long-Term Incentive Plan destined for the management of Enel SpA and/or of its subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code (\u20182022 LTI Plan\u2019), which contains the following three-year performance goals:\n  - average Enel TSR (Total Shareholders Return) vs average Euro Stoxx Utilities \u2013 UEM index TSR in the three-year period 2022-2024;\n  - cumulative ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) \u2013 WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) in the three-year period 2022-2024;\n  - emissions of GHG Scope 1 per equivalent kWh generated by the Group in 2024;\n  - percentage of women in the top management succession plans at the end of 2024.\n\nThe 2022 LTI Plan also requires any premium accrued to be represented by a share component, to which \u2013 based on the level of achievement of the various targets \u2013 a monetary component can be added. In particular, 130% of the base bonus of the Chief Executive Officer/General Manager (with respect to a maximum amount that can reach 280% of the base bonus) and 65% of the base bonus of the DRS (with respect to a maximum amount that can reach 180% of the base premium) is to be disbursed in Enel shares, mainly purchased from the Company. In addition, the disbursement of a significant portion of the long-term variable remuneration component (70% of the total) is deferred to the second subsequent financial year with respect to the three-years of reference for the objectives of the 2022 LTI Plan (i.e. \u201cdeferred payment\u201d).\n\nFor more information on the contents of the 2022 remuneration policy, refer to the Report on the Enel remuneration policy for 2022 and on the compensation paid in 2021, available on the Company website (www.enel.com).\n\nFinally, the table below presents for 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 the ratio between the total remuneration accrued by the Chief Executive Officer/General Manager of Enel and the average gross annual remuneration of Group employees (i.e. \u201cpay ratio\u201d). This report is indicated, for complete disclosure, also in reference to only the fixed component of the remunerations in question.\n\n| Year | Pay Ratio \u2013 Ratio between the total remuneration of the CEO/GM of Enel and the average annual gross remuneration of Group employees(1) |\n|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2022 | 60x (32x fixed remuneration)                                                                                                    |\n| 2021 | 90x (33x fixed remuneration)                                                                                                    |\n| 2020 | 143x (35x fixed remuneration)                                                                                                   |\n\n(1) To eliminate the exchange rate effect, the 2021 and 2020 amounts were recalculated using the 2022 exchange rate.\nEnel Group risk governance model\n\nWhen performing its industrial and commercial activities, the Enel Group is exposed to risks that could influence its economic and financial results if they are not effectively monitored, managed and mitigated. In this regard, in compliance with the architecture of the Internal Control and Risk Management System (\"ICRMS\") adopted by Enel, the Group has also implemented a risk governance model based on specific \u201cpillars\u201d, as well as a homogeneous taxonomy of risks (so-called \u201crisk catalogue\u201d) that facilitates management and organic representation.\n\nThe \u201cpillars\u201d of risk governance\n\nEnel has adopted a reference framework concerning risk governance that is expressed in detail through specific management, monitoring, control and reporting measures for each of the identified risk categories.\n\n1. **Lines of defense**. The Group\u2019s arrangements are structured along three lines of defense for risk management, monitoring and control activities, in compliance with the principle of segregating roles in the main areas in respect of significant risks.\n\n2. **Group Risk Committee**. This body, set up at management level and chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for strategic guidance and risk management supervision through:\n   - the analysis of the main exposures and the main risk issues for the Group;\n   - the adoption of specific risk policies applicable to Group companies in order to identify the roles and responsibilities for the risk management, monitoring and control processes, in compliance with the principle of organizational separation between the units responsible for management and those responsible for the monitoring and control of risks;\n   - the approval of specific operating limits, authorizing, where necessary and appropriate, exceptions to these limits for specific circumstances or needs;\n   - the definition of risk response strategies. The Group Risk Committee generally meets four times a year and can also be convened, where deemed necessary, by the Chief Executive Officer and by the head of the Risk Control unit, which is part of the Administration, Finance and Control Function. The committee met four times during 2022.\n\n3. **Integrated and wide-spread system of local risk committees**. The presence of specific local risk committees, according to the main global Business Lines and Countries and Regions of the Group and chaired by the respective top managers, provides adequate oversight of the most characteristic risks at the local level. The coordination of these committees with the Group Risk Committee facilitates the opportunity for sharing information and mitigation strategies regarding the most significant exposures with the Group\u2019s Top Management, as well as local implementation of the guidelines and strategies defined at Group level.\n\n---\n\n(2) More details can be found in the Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structure (www.enel.com, \u201cInvestors\u201d section), as well as in the ICRMS guidelines available in the \u201cGovernance\u201d section.\n4. Risk Appetite Framework (\u201cRAF\u201d). The Risk Appetite Framework represents the framework of reference for determining the appetite for risk and is an integrated and formalized system of elements that enable the definition and application of a single approach to the management, measurement and control of each risk. The RAF is summarized in the Risk Appetite Statement, a document that briefly describes the identified risk strategies and the indicators and/or limits applicable to each risk.\n\n5. Risk policy. The allocation of responsibilities, the coordination mechanisms and the main control activities are represented in specific policies and organizational documents defined according to specific approval procedures that involve the directly involved Company structures.\n\n6. Reporting. Specific and regular information flows on risk exposures and metrics, broken down at Group level and by individual global business line or geographical area, allow Enel\u2019s top management and corporate bodies to have an integrated view of the Group\u2019s main risk exposures, both current and prospective.\n\nThe Group\u2019s \u201crisk catalogue\u201d and the main ESG risks\n\nEnel has adopted a risk catalogue that represents a point of reference at the Group level and for all corporate units involved in risk management and monitoring processes. The adoption of a common language facilitates the mapping and comprehensive representation of risks within the Group, thus facilitating the identification of the main types of risk that impact Group processes and the roles of the organizational units involved in their management. The risk catalogue groups the types of risk into macro-categories, which include, as shown below, strategic, financial and operational risks, (non)-compliance risks, risks related to governance and culture as well as digital technology.\nDue to the nature of its business and its geographical distribution, the Group is exposed to different types of ESG risk (environmental, social, and governance), identified within the reference framework of risk categories adopted by Enel.\n\nThe following aspects were considered in order to identify the main potential ESG risks:\n\n- the results of the materiality analysis (see the section \u201cOur strategy for sustainable progress\u201d);\n- the 2023 Global Risk Report of the World Economic Forum (WEF), involving more than 1,000 experts and leaders from all over the world;\n- the risk assessments carried out as part of Enel\u2019s due diligence process on human rights, which involved numerous experts from different sectors, including civil society, academic institutions, local communities, customers and suppliers, in the various countries in which the Group operates;\n- the analyses of some of the most highly internationally accredited ESG rating agencies, which use specific risk assessment systems to rate the level of company performance in relation to sustainability.\n\nIn the risk identification and assessment stage, the \u201cPrecautionary Principle\u201d was applied, particularly in relation to risks relating to the environment, health, and safety. For each type of risk, specific actions have been identified to mitigate effects and ensure correct management. Enel also applies this principle to risk management, especially with regard to the development and introduction of new products/technologies, planning of operating assets and the development and construction of new plants/assets.\n\nThe following is a description of the main ESG risk types and the actions intended to mitigate the effects and assure their correct management.\n\n### STRATEGIC\n\n| Macroeconomic and geopolitical trends | Risk definition |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Risk of ineffective identification, assessment and monitoring of global economic, financial, political and social trends and monetary, fiscal and trade policies evolutions. |\n\n| Legislative and regulatory development | Risk of adverse evolution of legislative or regulatory landscape, and/or ineffective identification, assessment, management and monitoring of legislative/regulatory evolutions, communication of new compliance duties, execution of advocacy activities and internal gap analysis. Lack of a systematic assessment process on regulatory exposures coming from new strategic and business initiatives. |\n\n| Competitive landscape | Risk of ineffective identification, assessment and monitoring of evolutionary market trends that may impact Group competitive positioning, growth and profitability. |\n\n### Reference scenario and description of risk\n\nIn 2023, the macroeconomic context will see inflation levels well above the objectives of Central Banks in almost all economies.\n\nEven if it is expected for inflation to moderate gradually during the year, some underlying inflationary dynamics related to final services and goods could remain persistent over the coming quarters.\n\nTo address this, Central Banks could delay the process of normalizing their monetary policies, which will further exacerbate financial conditions.\n\nThis represents a strong risk especially in emerging economies such as Latin America, where further generalized worsening of the risk appetite could lead to further capital outflows and greater costs for the bond issues for local governments. Furthermore, new risks can resurface with the spread of new Covid-19 variants, which could force governments to reintroduce measures that restrict mobility and, as a result, generate new distortions on a supply chain level.\n\n---\n\n(3) Rio Declaration on the Environment and Development (Rio de Janeiro, June 3-14, 1992), Principle 15.\nMitigation actions and associated strategic goals\n\nThe considerable internationalization of the Group \u2013 which has a presence in many regions, including South America, North America and Africa \u2013 requires Enel to consider country risk, i.e., risks of a macroeconomic, financial, institutional, social or climatic nature and those specifically associated with the energy sector whose occurrence could have a significant adverse impact on both revenue flows and the value of corporate assets.\n\nEnel has adopted a quantitative Open Country Risk assessment model capable of specifically monitoring the riskiness of the countries in which it operates. The Open Country Risk model offer a broader view of the risk factors that can impact a country. The model is divided into four risk components: economic, institutional and political, social, and energy factors.\n\nMore specifically, the Open Country Risk model has the ambition to measure the economic resilience of each country, which is defined as a balanced position with respect to the external environment, effectiveness of domestic policies, the vulnerability of the banking and corporate system that can predict systemic crisis, attractiveness in terms of economic growth and, ultimately, a quantification of extreme climate events as a source of environmental and economic stress (economic factors). In addition, an assessment is performed of the robustness of institutions and the political context (institutional and political factors), an in-depth analysis of social phenomenon and human rights targeted toward measuring the level of well-being, inclusion and social progress (social factors), the efficiency of the energy system and its position within the energy transition process, which are essential factors for assessing the sustainability of investments over a medium-long term period (energy factors).\n\nRisk definition\n\nRisk of ineffective identification, assessment and management of risks related to climate changes \u2013 caused by acute and chronic events (physical risks) and by effects of regulatory, technology and market trends arising from the transition to a lower-carbon economy (transition risks) \u2013 through strategic and operating initiatives of adaptation and mitigation of climate risks.\n\nReference scenario and description of risk\n\nThe physical risks arising from climate change can be classified as acute (or extreme events) or chronic: the former are linked to extremely intense weather-climatic conditions, while the latter refer to gradual and enduring changes in climatic conditions.\n\nExtreme events may expose the Group to potential unavailability of assets and infrastructure, service restoration costs, inconvenience for customers, etc. Chronic changes in climatic conditions, on the other hand, may expose the Group to other physical risks or opportunities (depending on the geographical location): for example, structural changes in rainfall or wind patterns could impact the Group\u2019s business in generation terms, while structural temperature changes can impact electricity demand.\n\nWith regard to the energy transition process towards a more sustainable model with a progressive electrification and reduction in CO\u2082 emissions in line with the Group\u2019s decarbonization strategy, there are risks, but above all opportunities, tied to both the changing regulatory context and the technological and electrification trends, and resulting market developments, with potential effects also on commodity and energy prices.\n\nMitigation actions and associated strategic goals\n\nIn order to facilitate the proper identification and management of risks and opportunities related to climate change, a Group policy was published in 2021. The policy describes common guidelines for assessing the risks and opportunities arising from climate change. The \u201cClimate change risks and opportunities\u201d policy defines a shared approach for the integration of climate change and energy transition issues into the Group\u2019s processes and activities, thus informing industrial and strategic choices to improve business resilience and long-term sustainable value creation, consistent with the adaptation and mitigation strategy.\n\nA detailed description of the strategic objectives and mitigation actions/management methods is provided in the \u201cZero emissions ambition\u201d chapter of this document.\n**Risk definition**\n\nRisk that inappropriate working operations or machineries may adversely impact on the environment quality and ecosystems involved.\n\nRisk of a breach in complying with international, country or local environmental laws and regulations.\n\n**Reference scenario and description of risk**\n\nIn recent years, a growing sensitivity of the entire community has emerged in relation to risks linked to models of development that generate impacts on the quality of the environment and on ecosystems, with the exploitation of scarce natural resources (including raw materials and water).\n\nIn some cases, synergistic effects between these impacts, such as global warming and the growing exploitation and degradation of water resources, increase the risk of environmental emergencies arising in the most sensitive areas of the planet, with the risk of competition among different water resource uses, i.e. industrial, agricultural, and civil.\n\nTo address these needs, institutions are updating environmental regulations to be more restrictive, placing increasingly stringent constraints on the development of new industrial initiatives, obliging or facilitating a shift away from technologies considered to be no longer sustainable in what are seen as the highest impact sectors.\n\nAlso the international commitment to mitigating impacts on biodiversity is growing, as already shown in Europe by the Green Deal and introduced in 2022 by the Global Biodiversity Framework approved at COP 15 in Montreal. In this context, companies in each sector, and especially leading companies, increasingly aware that environmental risks are also economic risks, are urged to step up their commitment and take on greater responsibility in identifying and adopting innovative and sustainable technical solutions and development models.\n\n**Mitigation actions and associated strategic goals**\n\nEnel has made the effective prevention and minimization of environmental impacts and risks a foundational element of each project across its entire life cycle. The adoption of ISO 14001-certified Environmental Management Systems certified within the Group ensures the presence of structured policies and procedures to identify and manage the environmental risks and opportunities associated with all corporate activities.\n\nA structured control plan combined with actions and improvement objectives inspired by the best environmental practices, with requirements higher than those linked to simple environmental regulatory compliance, mitigates the risk of impacts on the environmental matrix, reputational damage and legal disputes. An important contribution is also made by the multiplicity of actions to achieve the challenging environmental improvement goals established by Enel, concerning e.g. atmospheric emissions, waste produced, and water consumption, especially in high water stress areas, and impacts on habitats and species.\n\nThe risk of water scarcity is directly mitigated by Enel\u2019s development strategy, which is based on the growth of generation from renewable sources that are essentially not dependent on the availability of water for their operation. Special attention is also devoted to assets in areas with a high level of water stress, in order to develop technological solutions to reduce consumption. Ongoing collaboration with local river basin management authorities enables us to adopt the most effective shared strategies for the sustainable management of hydroelectric generation assets.\n\nFinally, suitable actions are being implemented for ecosystems in order to protect, restore and conserve biodiversity, the natural species in the habitats, respecting the principle of mitigation hierarchy (avoid, minimize, restore and compensate), as well as suitable terrestrial, marine and river monitoring activities to check the effectiveness of the adopted measures.\n\nEnel is an active part of the international debate with stakeholders and the networks with the most influence on the topic (for example, Business for Nature, Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosure, World Business Council for Sustainable Development and Science Based Targets for Nature).\n\nFor the issues related to nature and biodiversity, also refer to the \u201cConservation of natural capital\u201d chapter in this document.\nHealth and safety\n\nRisk definition\n\nRisk that inappropriate working environments, structures, machineries and business operations may negatively impact on health & safety conditions of employees and other stakeholders involved.\n\nRisk of a breach in complying with international, country or local laws and regulations on health and safety.\n\nReference scenario and description of risk\n\nThe main health and safety risks to which Enel\u2019s people and contractors are exposed are related to the operating assets carried out at the Group\u2019s sites and its assets. In this context, violation of the laws, regulations, and procedures in force concerning to health and safety, workplaces, management of structures, company assets and processes, which can have a negative impact on the health of employees, workers, and stakeholders, can give rise to the risk of administrative or judicial penalties with associated economic-financial and reputational impacts. The main operational risks for safety and health are evaluated in depth at each site or Company asset.\n\nThese risks were identified by analyzing the main events that occurred in the past three years. In particular, in relation to probability of occurrence, mechanical risks (falls, knocks, crushing and cuts) are the most likely, whilst in terms of potential associated impact, electrical risks are those with the most severe consequences (fatalities).\n\nAlso, in relation to the Group\u2019s presence in different geographical contexts worldwide, employees and contractors may be exposed to health risks relating to emerging infectious diseases, of epidemic and potentially pandemic nature, which may affect their good health and well-being.\n\nMitigation actions and associated strategic goals\n\nEnel has adopted a Declaration of Commitment to Health and Safety, signed by the Group\u2019s Top Management.\n\nFor its implementation, each of the Group\u2019s Business Lines has its own Occupational Health and Safety Management System in compliance with international standard BS OHSAS 45001, based on identifying hazards, qualitative and quantitative risk assessment, planning and implementing preventive and protective measures, verifying the effectiveness of preventive and protective measures, and any corrective actions required.\n\nThe Enel Group has defined a structured health management system based on preventive and protective measures, functional also in respect of the development of a corporate culture oriented towards promoting mental-physical health and the organizational well-being of workers, and also the balance between the professional and personal spheres.\n\nThis system also considers the rigorous selection and management of contractors and suppliers, promoting their involvement in continuous safety performance improvement programs.\n\nFurthermore, with regard to emergencies relating to risks resulting from the current and persistent pandemic scenario, a unit has been set up within the Holding P&O Function with references in each Business Line and Country, in order to assure the definition of the global strategy and policies for management of the emergency and their adoption in every Group organization.\n\nIn particular, this organizational structure and the related management processes make it possible to direct, integrate and monitor, both at Group and Country level, all the prevention, protection and intervention actions aimed at protecting the health of employees and contractors, also in relation to exogenous health risk factors that may not be strictly related to work activities.\n\nFurther information on risk management is given in the \u201cOccupational health and safety\u201d chapter.\n**Customers\u2019 needs and satisfaction**\n\n**Risk definition**\nRisk of failure of Group\u2019s products and services in achieving customers\u2019 expectations and needs in terms of quality, accessibility, sustainability and innovation.\n\n**Reference scenario and description of risk**\nThe leadership of a company like Enel necessarily passes through customer care and attention to quality service, aspects that refer not only to the supply of electricity and/or natural gas, but also and above all to the intangible aspects of the service perceived by the customer.\n\nPotential increase in the number of vulnerable customers and energy poverty due to an increase in the price of electricity.\n\n**Mitigation actions and associated strategic goals**\nThe Company is constantly committed to maximizing value for customers:\n- through a robust business model that focuses on the continuous improvement of efficiency, effectiveness and resilience in process management (activation of new services, billing, payments and credit, customer focus) and digitalization.\n- making them more aware with offers geared towards increasing awareness of their consumption, different time slots, rewards for reducing consumption compared to the past, clear and simple communication;\n- proactively managing their needs;\n- accompanying them toward electrification.\n\nFurthermore, Enel supplies innovative and inclusive products and services for customers of all ages, weak, destitute, marginalized, vulnerable families (for example the so-called \u201csocial bonus\u201d as a form of support for paying the bills for vulnerable families).\n\nThe Group monitors the rate of customer satisfaction in every Country in which it operates through specific surveys and analysis of the received feedback.\n\nFurther information on risk management is provided in the \u201cClean electrification\u201d chapter.\n\n---\n\n**Procurement, logistics and supply chain**\n\n**Risk definition**\nRisk of ineffective procurement or contract management activities, due to inadequate requirements definition or supplier qualification process, a frequent recourse to direct awarding, scouting activities shortcomings, poor monitoring over the fulfillment of contractual duties, non-application of penalties.\n\n**Reference scenario and description of risk**\nEnel could be exposed to reputational, economic or financial risks following ineffective procurement activities along the entire process. Starting from the supplier qualification phase in which, for example, an analysis is not performed regarding environmental and social aspects (including work practices, such as refusal of forced or child labor, respect for diversity and non-discrimination, freedom of association and collective bargaining, fair and favorable working conditions); during the tender stage, not requiring specific sustainability requirements; during the entire contract period without correctly monitoring the requirements applied in the tender; in the case of excessive recourse to direct awards, and the failure to apply penalties.\nMitigation actions and associated strategic goals\n\nGroup procurement processes and the related governance documents constitute a structured system of standards and checkpoints that make it possible to combine the achievement of economic business goals with full compliance with the fundamental principles set down in the Policy on Human Rights, Code of Ethics, Enel Global Compliance Program, and Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan, while continuing to promote initiatives aimed at sustainable economic development.\n\nThese principles are expressed in the processes and organizational measures that Enel has decided to adopt from a self-regulation point of view in order to establish relationships of trust with all its stakeholders and to define stable and constructive relations that do not only guarantee economic competitiveness but that account for the best practices in essential areas for the Group, such as the refusal of forced and child labor, promotion of occupational health and safety conditions, and environmental responsibility. Thanks to greater interaction and integration with the external world and with the various parts of the Company organization, the procurement process is taking on an increasingly central role in value creation as it contributes to creating a resilient and sustainable supply chain, thinking in terms of circular economy, encouraging innovation, sharing the Group\u2019s values and objectives with suppliers who, as such, become partners and enabler for achieving Enel\u2019s targets.\n\nMore specifically, reward factors are introduced in the tenders, aimed at generating virtuous behavior on the part of our suppliers: for example, the environmental impact of any customer is strongly influenced by the impact of its upstream supply chain. Global Procurement therefore pushes its suppliers to objectively measure their carbon footprint and to embark on pathways of improvement.\n\nFrom the perspective of the procurement process, the preferred tool is that of a tender, which guarantees maximum competition and equal opportunity of access to all operators having the necessary technical, economic-financial, environmental, safety, human rights, legal and ethical characteristics. Procurement by direct award and without competitive bidding can occur only in exceptional suitably motivated circumstances in compliance with relevant statutory legislation.\n\nMoreover, the supplier qualification system, the same one throughout the Enel Group, checks \u2013 even before the procurement process starts \u2013 that potential suppliers are in line with the strategic corporate vision and with expectations in relation to all the mentioned profiles and requirements.\n\nWith regard to the risk governance system, the Group is focused on the application of metrics that indicate the level of risk before and after the mitigation action, in order to implement precautionary actions to reduce uncertainty to a tolerable level or to mitigate any impacts in all business, technological and geographical areas.\n\nThe effectiveness of risk management in the supply chain is monitored using specific indicators, including the probability of insolvency, the concentration of contracts with individual suppliers or industrial groups, the supplier\u2019s dependence on Enel, the performance index for proper conduct during the tender, quality, punctuality and sustainability in the execution of the contract, Country risk, etc., for which thresholds are defined that guide the definition of the procurement, negotiation and award strategy of a tender, allowing informed choices based on potential risks and benefits (savings).\n\nDuring the Covid-19 emergency, actions were taken, which were made structural, for the differentiation of procurement sources (to prevent interruptions in the supply chain) and for performing, remotely, activities that would normally require physical interaction between Enel and the supplier (e.g. company on-site inspections).\n\nFurthermore, in order to counter the consequences of the geopolitical situation in Ukraine, which increased market volatility and further stressed the supply chain, which already seriously tested during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic, Global Procurement constantly monitors the activities inherent to the supply/logistics chain, also with the active participation of the suppliers, through a specific contractual obligation to monitor in order to mitigate the risks deriving from market shortages or critical issues regarding logistics and business interruptions.\n\nFurther information on risk management is provided in the \u201cSustainable supply chain\u201d chapter.\n**Risk definition**\n\nRisk of partial or total interruption of business operations arising from technical failures, assets and plants malfunctions, human errors, sabotages, raw materials unavailability or adverse weather events.\n\n**Reference scenario and description of risk**\n\nEnel may be exposed to the risk of judicial or administrative sanctions, economic or financial losses, and reputational damage as a result of partial or total interruption of commercial operations and of electricity supplies to customers, caused by technical faults, malfunctions of assets and plants, human error, sabotage, unavailability of raw materials or adverse weather events, or infectious diseases with epidemic or pandemic potential that may limit the normal functioning of the Group\u2019s activities or of its supply chain.\n\n**Mitigation actions and associated strategic goals**\n\nEnel has systems and mechanisms to guarantee a continuous and safe energy supply to the national electrical systems of the countries in which it operates. Enel is therefore constantly at work to develop and improve the efficiency of the transport and distribution network, in coordination with the other entities operating on the network infrastructure in various capacities. Enel carries out actions of network development, modernization, and maintenance on the infrastructure existing in all Countries, with the primary aim of improving the quality of the service delivered and reducing the number and duration of outages. Enel also constantly takes operational efficiency and safety measures to guarantee correct functioning and availability of all its power plants. Lastly, the Group\u2019s assets are covered by adequate insurance mechanisms to protect the Company from potential negative economic consequences resulting from future and uncertain events.\n\nMoreover, with special reference to the management of critical events, Enel has drawn up Group, Business Line and Country policies to ensure effectiveness of the decision-making process in the management of any event that could impair continuity of the public service and the Company\u2019s business, including health emergencies with a local and/or global impact.\n\nEnel implements adequate protocols, plans and actions to ensure the smooth running of its business activity worldwide or, if necessary, its rapid recovery in the event of service interruptions.\n\nEspecially in relation to the health emergency, Enel defines specific protocols designed to limit the spread of contagion among the people involved in operating assets and consequently guarantee the continuity of service.\n\nFurther information on risk management is provided in the \u201cClean electrification\u201d and \u201cSustainable supply chain\u201d chapters.\nRisk definition\n\nRisk of inadequacy of Group\u2019s organizational structures or lack of internal skills caused by the absence or inadequacy of training programs, ineffectiveness of incentive schemes, inadequate turnover planning process or inability to define effective employees recruiting processes and retention policies.\n\nReference scenario and description of risk\n\nEnel has placed sustainability at the center of its strategy as the core of its business model in order to contribute toward reaching the sustainable development goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda. The Group has divided sustainability into different geographic, economic and social contexts to guide the just transition, which is essential for the future of the planet, accelerating the aims to lead the transition towards a more sustainable development system, essential for the future of the planet, accelerating the process of decarbonization of its energy mix through the increase in renewables and the ever-increasing electrification of consumption. The profound social, economic and cultural transformations we are experiencing, from energy transition to the digitalization and technological innovation processes have a profound impact also on the world of work, renewing the paradigms, imposing significant cultural and organizational changes that require new professional profiles and skills.\n\nTo face the change, it is mandatory to act in an inclusive manner, putting people at the center in relation to their social and work aspects, with tools suitable for facing this epic transformation. Organizations must be increasingly oriented toward new agile and flexible work and business models that are sustainable along the entire value chain. It is also essential to adopt policies that value diversity and the talents of everyone, with the awareness that the contribution of the individual represents an essential component for the creation of widespread and shared value.\n\nMitigation actions and associated strategic goals\n\nRecognition of the value of a person as unique, constant listening, empathy, sharing, passion, involvement are only some of the key words that guide our way of working and experiencing the Company, along a pathway that starts from I and arrives at Us.\n\nThe centrality of persons and the management of human capital take on a fundamental role in energy transition as enabling factors and represent the priorities to which specific objectives are linked, the main ones including: development of digital skills and expertise, promotion of reskilling and upskilling programs for our people (continuous, customized, flexible, accessible and transversal) to ensure long life employability, the sharing of best sector practices and training targeted also to those who work with our people, both suppliers and contractors, the correct wide-spread involvement of the Company purpose, which ensures better results supported by higher personal satisfaction, understood as motivation and well-being; development of the workplace and performance appraisal systems; the dissemination, in all the Countries in which the Group is present, of the diversity and inclusion policy, as well as an inclusive organizational culture based on principles of non-discrimination and equal opportunities, key drivers to attract and retain talent.\n\nThe Group is committed to strengthening the resilience and flexibility of its organizational models through the simplification and digitalization of processes, in order to enable the autonomy and responsibilities of the individuals and teams, strengthening our people empowerment processes and favoring the entrepreneurial approach through a \u201cgentle\u201d leadership model that promotes talents, attitudes and aspirations of persons in the affirmation of Us. The hybrid work method, which combines work on site and remote working in flexible proportions that take the needs of everyone into account, such as the use of innovative and flexible organizational models, are tools targeted toward sustaining this evolution of the organizational culture in terms of trust and responsibility rather than hierarchy and control.\n\nIn line with this strategy, also social dialog is evolving toward a model that increasingly reinforces the centrality of persons. For example, Enel and the Italian trade unions signed the \u201cCharter of the Person\u201d, an innovative protocol focused on the well-being, involvement, motivation and participation of the individual, whose principles were also welcomed and implemented in other Countries where the Group is present.\n\nThe commitment is also targeted toward creating figures in the organization who, as \u201cambassadors\u201d, promote the adoption of shared models and behaviors that are focused on the sustainability of relations.\n\nFurther information on risk management is provided in the \u201cEmpowering Enel people\u201d chapter.\nRisk definition\n\nRisk to ineffectively engage key stakeholders on Enel\u2019s strategic positioning on sustainability and financial goals due to a lack of understanding, anticipating or orienting their expectations, which might cause an incomplete integration of such expectations into Group\u2019s business strategy and sustainability planning processes, with a potential negative impact on its reputation and competitiveness.\n\nReference scenario and description of risk\n\nThe risk of ineffective engagement of key stakeholders in relation to the strategic positioning of Enel on sustainability and financial objectives, due to the lack of understanding, anticipation, or orientation of their expectations, could cause incomplete integration of such expectations within the Company\u2019s business strategy and sustainability planning processes, with a potential negative impact on its reputation and competitiveness.\n\nEnel currently operates in a vast geographical area, with a presence in more than 40 countries distributed in five continents, conducting business activities that call for the development of infrastructure in local areas, which can provoke criticism or potential disputes with communities in some cases. Such conditions could lead to delays in the execution of projects for new sites and impacts on operational continuity, with a potential negative economic-financial and reputational effect.\n\nOn the other hand, Enel\u2019s commitment to decarbonize its energy mix \u2013 with a particular focus on the coal mining phase \u2013 could have a potential negative impact in local areas that are heavily dependent on coal operations (mining and electricity generation) in terms of job losses and socio-economic development. This could ultimately expose Enel to reputational risks or even delay the Group\u2019s achievement of the decarbonization goals set out in its Strategic Plan. In the meantime, the outlook of investors is shifting fast: the changes in progress and challenges presented by the modern world are also revolutionizing the method of investing.\n\nESG investors are growing constantly: at December 31, 2022, SRI funds constituted approximately 14.9% of the share capital (14.6% higher at December 31, 2021), while PRI (Principles for Responsible Investment) signatory investors represent 42.1% of the share capital. (vs 46.6% at December 31, 2021). The possible incorrect or incomplete disclosure by Enel of the results obtained, and likewise ineffective communications to the financial community of its strategy, which aims to create value for customers, society, and the environment, could have significant negative impacts on the assessment of Enel\u2019s shares and bonds.\n\nMitigation actions and associated strategic goals\n\nIn order to identify the priority issues for the Company and its stakeholders, materiality analysis is carried out annually, aimed at engaging and listening to all the Group\u2019s main stakeholders.\n\nFrom an operational viewpoint, knowledge of specific local requirements and continually listening to the needs of stakeholders are fundamental elements for mapping as comprehensively as possible the potential positive, but also negative impacts that the Group\u2019s activity has on the communities where our plants operate. Since 2015, a Creating Shared Value (CSV) model has been in force, centered on the integration of sustainability in the business, in which the Company\u2019s success is directly related to the prosperity of the communities where it operates.\n\nThe CSV model, applied to all Business Lines, therefore introduces a new way of managing community relations and integrating socio-environmental factors within our business processes and throughout the entire value chain, with special reference to operations of business development, engineering and construction and procurement, in addition to the management and maintenance of assets.\n\nThrough specific context analysis tools, stakeholder mapping and the definition of materiality matrices and action plans, the development of a business project is accompanied by initial exploratory approaches to its final definition.\nIn addition, Enel promotes a fair and inclusive energy transition, through global reconversion and hybridization projects, which currently involve more than 40 sites around the world, with the aim of finding sustainable solutions (focused primarily on the development of energy reconversion and hybridization, promoting the circular economy and innovation) for the areas involved with the closure of conventional plants. By means of dialog with shareholders and bondholders, the Investor Relations unit collects feedback on how to integrate and improve the Group\u2019s reporting process and make its communications as effective as possible, meeting the needs of the financial markets.\n\nFurther information on risk management can be found in the \u201cOur strategy for sustainable progress\u201d section and in the \u201cEngaging communities\u201d and \u201cSound governance\u201d chapters.\n\nDIGITAL TECHNOLOGY\n\nRisk definition\n\nRisk of cyber-attacks and sensitive or massive corporate and customers data stealing, ascribable to a lack of security of networks, operating systems and databases.\n\nReference scenario and description of risk\n\nThe speed of technological development, which brings an endless stream of new challenges, the frequency and intensity of the ever-increasing number of cyberattacks, as well as the tendency to strike critical infrastructure and strategic industrial sectors, highlight a risk that can cause normal business operations to grind to a halt in extreme cases. Cyberattacks have changed dramatically in recent years: the number has grown exponentially, as has their level of complexity and impact, with timely identification of sources becoming increasingly difficult. Within the scope of the Group, the management of the cyber security risk results, among other aspects, from the numerous contexts in which it operates (data, industry, and people), in addition to the intrinsic complexity and interconnection of resources which, over the years, have been increasingly integrated into routine operating processes.\n\nMitigation actions and associated strategic goals\n\nThe Group has designed and adopted a holistic governance model in relation to cyber security, which is applied to the Information Technology (IT), Operational Technology (OT) and the Internet of Things (IoT) sectors. The framework is based on the commitment of Top Management, the global strategic approach, the involvement of all business areas, as well as the units engaged in the design and implementation of systems. The framework also strives to use the best technology available on the market to design ad hoc business processes, also working on the human factor through initiatives targeted toward increasing awareness and knowledge regarding cyber security by people, making them the first lever of company defense. Furthermore, the framework directs the regulatory requirements regarding IT security, such as the execution of in-depth tests (in IT, OT and IoT areas) that aim to identify and remove vulnerabilities, identify and strengthen people\u2019s IT awareness and implement regulatory requirements related to IT security.\n\nMoreover, the Group has defined and adopted a risk management method for IT security in accordance with risk-based and cyber security by design approaches, thereby making the corporate risk analysis a key step in all strategic decisions and integrating the safety requirements along the entire solution and service life cycle. Enel has also set up a Cyber Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) to respond to and proactively manage possible incidents in the field of cyber security. In addition, since 2019, in order to mitigate exposure not only with technical countermeasures, the Group has taken out insurance on the risks related to cyber security.\n\nFurther information on risk management is provided in the \u201cDigitalization\u201d and \u201cInnovation\u201d chapters.\nDigitalization, IT effectiveness, and service continuity\n\nRisk definition\nRisk of managing ineffective business processes and supporting higher operating costs due to a lack of digitalization in terms of workflows coverage, systems integration and adoption of new technologies.\nRisk of ineffective support of IT systems to business processes and operating activities.\nRisk of exposure of IT/OT systems to service interruptions and data losses.\n\nReference scenario and description of risk\nThe Group is carrying out a complete digital transformation of the management of the entire energy value chain, developing new business models and digitalizing its business processes, integrating the systems and adopting new technologies. One result of this digital transformation is that the Group is increasingly exposed to risks relating to the operations of IT systems integrated across the Company, with impacts on processes and operating assets that could lead to the exposure of IT and OT systems to service interruptions or data losses.\n\nMitigation actions and associated strategic goals\nControl of such risks is guaranteed by a series of internal measures developed by the Group to oversee the digital transformation. In particular, an internal control system has been set up, which introduces control points along the entire IT value chain, enabling us to prevent the emergence of risks relating to such issues as the creation of services that do not meet business needs, the failure to implement adequate security measures and service interruptions. The internal control system oversees both the activities performed in-house and those outsourced to external associates and service providers. Enel is also promoting the dissemination of digital culture and skills within the Group, so as to guide the digital transformation successfully and minimize the associated risks.\n\nFurther information on risk management is provided in the \u201cDigitalization\u201d and \u201cInnovation\u201d chapters.\n\nCOMPLIANCE\n\nData protection\n\nRisk definition\nRisk of a breach in complying with applicable data protection and privacy laws.\n\nReference scenario and description of risk\nIn the era of digitalization and globalization of markets, Enel\u2019s business strategy is focused on accelerating the process of transformation towards a business model based on a digital platform, by means of a data driven and customer-focused approach, which is being developed throughout the entire value chain.\nThe Company, which is present in more than 40 countries, has the largest customer based in the public utilities sector (around 70 million customers), with a current workforce of approximately 67 thousand people; consequently, the Group\u2019s new business model calls for management of an ever larger volume of personal data, to reach the financial and business results set down in the 2022-2024 Strategic Plan.\nThis implies an exposure to the risks associated with personal data protection (also due to the increasing volume of privacy regulations in the majority of countries in which Enel is present). These risks can take the form of a loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the personal data of customers, employees, and others (e.g. suppliers), resulting in the application of penalties in proportion to global sales, obstructing processes with consequent economic or financial losses and reputational damage.\n\nMitigation actions and associated strategic goals\nIn order to manage and mitigate this risk, Enel has adopted a global model of personal data governance, also through the assignment of Data Protection Officers \u2013 \u201cDPOs\u201d \u2013 both at a global and Country level, as well as through the adoption of digital compliance instruments to map applications and processes and manage relevant risks to personal data protection, in compliance with the specific aspects of local sector regulations.\n\nFurther information on risk management can be found in the \u201cData protection\u201d section of this chapter.\nOther compliance risks\n\nRisk definition\n\nOther compliance risks: Antitrust compliance and consumers\u2019 rights, Corruption, External disclosure. Financial regulation compliance, Tax compliance, Compliance with other laws and regulations.\n\nReference scenario and description of risk\n\nEnel may be exposed to the risk of judicial measures, administrative sanctions, economic or financial losses and reputational damage as a result of:\n\n- illegal or illicit conduct, including active and passive acts of corruption, perpetrated by personnel inside or outside the Group in order to secure an unjust benefit for themselves or for others;\n- infringement of international, national or local laws and regulations concerning: accounting, financial, or tax discipline, market disclosures, anti-trust and consumer rights issues or other applicable legislative provisions (e.g. rules concerning permitting or contracts, regulation of electricity markets, international sanctions, etc.).\n\nMitigation actions and associated strategic goals\n\nEnel has adopted an Internal Control and Risk Management System expressed in company rules and procedures that all who work in Enel or on behalf of Enel are required to follow, by means of their respective contractual commitments. The Internal Control System also includes specific compliance programs, i.e.: the Code of Ethics, the Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan (\u201cZTC Plan\u201d), the Policy on Human Rights, the Policy on international sanctions, the Enel Global Compliance Program (\u201cEGCP\u201d), the Model pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/01 and other national compliance programs adopted by Group companies in accordance with their national legislation. Furthermore, to further pursue its commitment to fighting corruption, Enel voluntarily decided to certify its Anti-Bribery Management System (SGPC) in compliance with the requirements of international standard ISO 37001:2016 (international certification of anti-bribery management systems). This certification process has involved the Group\u2019s main subsidiaries.\n\nExternal staff, working for Enel Group company suppliers, undertake to comply with the ethical clauses set out in their respective contracts, which incorporate references to Enel\u2019s commitment in terms of business integrity in the pursuit of its activities.\n\nThe ongoing monitoring of legislative and regulatory developments at the local, national and international levels is guaranteed by the operations of specific company Functions with competence in relation to these matters.\n\nThe Sustainability Report, which represents the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement, is subjected to a limited review by KPMG and for a set of indicators, also providing reasonable assurance.\n\nFurther information on risk management is provided in the \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter and the \u201cMethodological note\u201d.\n\nIn relation to the specific contexts pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 254/16 concerning climate change, human rights, and the fight against corruption, we invite you to refer to the sections dedicated to these topics in this Sustainability Report.\n\nThe other types of risk to which the Enel Group is exposed are detailed in the \u201cRisk Management\u201d section of the Integrated Annual Report available on the website (www.enel.com, \u201cInvestors\u201d section).\nTransparency in institutional processes\n\nEnel constantly manages relations with institutions (local, national, European, and international) in line with the Enel Compliance Program, providing complete and transparent information with the aim of placing institutional counterparts in the best possible position to make the decisions within the sphere of their competence. Enel also contributes to the consultation processes regarding political and legislative dossiers on energy and environmental issues. In the context of relations with European institutions, Enel actively contributes to every phase of the consultation process on political and legislative dossiers of corporate interest through careful monitoring and analysis (see also the chapter \u201cZero emissions ambition\u201d).\n\nThe Enel Group has been enrolled in the EU voluntary transparency register since its creation in 2008. The register aims to provide citizens with a single and direct access point to information on who carries out activities aimed at influencing the EU decision-making process, the interests pursued, and the resources invested in these activities (http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/homePage.do). In line with the provisions of the Code of Ethics, paragraph 3.26, Enel does not finance political parties, their representatives or candidates in Italy or abroad, nor does it sponsor conventions or events whose sole purpose is political propaganda. It refrains from any direct or indirect pressure on politicians (for example, by granting the use of its facilities, accepting new recruit recommendations, or awarding consultancy contracts). Enel and its subsidiaries are present in various trade and employer associations whose role includes representing the positioning of its members in the regulatory processes inherent in the business activity. The annual contributions paid to the above-mentioned organizations in the form of membership fees in 2022 totaled approximately 9.6 million euros, compared to 8.4 million euros in 2021. In particular, in 2022 the three largest contributions in terms of overall amount concerned AELEC (Asociaci\u00f3n de Empresas de Energ\u00eda El\u00e9ctrica) in Spain, Confindustria and Elettricit\u00e0 Futura in Italy.\n\nThe institutional dialogue with the trade and employer associations in which Enel and its subsidiaries took part in 2022 concerned the support of regulatory and consultation processes, including also the following main issues:\n\n- **development of energy policies**: including, among other topics, the strategic outlook of the sector, energy efficiency, the growth of renewables, smart grid development and energy costs.\n- **increasing business competitiveness**: including, among other topics, tax regulation, labor law issues and environmental policies.\n\n---\n\n(4) These amounts include the contributions paid by Enel SpA (including the main Italian companies) and by its foreign subsidiaries Endesa, Enel Am\u00e9ricas and Enel Chile.\n\n(5) Specifically: AELEC (formerly UNESA) 1.9 million euros; Confindustria 1.5 million euros; Elettricit\u00e0 Futura (formerly \u2018Associazione Nazionale delle Imprese Elettriche\u2019) 0.6 million euros.\n\n(6) The 2022 contribution was 5.5 million euros.\n\n(7) The 2022 contribution was 4.0 million euros.\nValues and pillars of corporate ethics\n\nA solid and dynamic ethical system, constantly oriented towards implementing best practices on the national and international levels is the foundational element of the Enel system of values underpinning the Company\u2019s operating assets, and of relations entertained with all its key stakeholders. A system based on compliance programs, including the Code of Ethics, Policy on Human Rights, the Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan (ZTC Plan), Enel Global Compliance Program, the Model pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/01, plus any other national compliance models adopted by Group companies in accordance with local regulations.\n\nCode of Ethics\n\nIn 2002, Enel adopted at Code of Ethics that expresses the commitments and ethical responsibilities to which it adheres in its operating assets, regulating and harmonizing corporate conduct according to standards based on the maximum transparency and integrity towards all stakeholders. The Code of Ethics is applicable to the entire Group, notwithstanding the cultural, social, and economic diversity between the various countries in which Enel operates. Enel also requires all its main suppliers and partners to adopt conduct in line with the Code\u2019s general principles. More information is available on the website https://www.enel.com/investors/sustainability/daily-commitment/sound-governance-ethical-conduct/principles-underpinning-our-work/code-ethics.\n\nStakeholder reports\n\nAny violation or suspected violation of the ethical system can be reported, also anonymously, through a single platform at Group level (\u201cEthics Point\u201d), which is accessible at www.enel.ethicspoint.com. The Audit Function receives and analyzes these reports, performing the related checks and ensuring uniform treatment at Group level, in compliance with Company policies and local regulations.\n\nThe reports management process is governed by the whistleblowing policy, \u201cManagement of anonymous and non-anonymous reports\u201d, which guarantees anonymity and protection against any form of retaliation and also ensures adequate protection against groundless reports made maliciously to harm or cause prejudice to individuals and/or companies.\n\n| KPI | UM | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2022-2021 | % |\n|-----|----|------|------|------|-----------|---|\n| Reports received | n. | 172 | 153 | 151 | 2 | +12.4 |\n| Violations related to incidents of | n. | 29 | 44 | 26 | -15 | -34.1 |\n| Conflict of interest/corruption | n. | 9 | 8 | 2 | +1 | +12.5 |\n| Misappropriation | n. | 4 | 5 | 14 | -1 | -20.0 |\n| Labor practices | n. | 11 | 27 | 9 | -16 | -59.3 |\n| Community and society | n. | - | 1 | - | -1 | - |\n| Other reasons | n. | 5 | 3 | 1 | +2 | +66.7 |\n\n(8) Last update: February 2021.\n(9) The Ethics Channel can also be used to send reports regarding the Group\u2019s commitments regarding human rights.\n(10) Of the 172 reports received in 2022, 15 are being analyzed. During the year, the verification of all the reports received in 2021 was completed: the number of confirmed violations for 2021 was therefore revised from 41 to 44. The three additional violations are to be ascribed to a case of conflict of interest and two cases of inappropriate behaviour related to labor practices.\n(11) In 2022 4 violations were recorded relating to cases of discrimination at the workplace, in particular cases of harassment.\nDuring 2022 172 reports were received, recording a slight increase as compared to the number of reports received in 2021 (153), mostly in countries on the South American content.\n\nThe analyses confirmed a limited number of violations, decreased as compared to 2021, referring to the behavior of employees and/or suppliers that does not comply with the policies on the protection of persons or the internal procedures regarding:\n\n- \u201cConflict of interest/corruption\u201d for the pursuit of personal interests or interests that harm the company;\n- \u201cLabor practices\u201d, connected to inappropriate behavior by individual employees that is detrimental to respect for diversity and non-discrimination and the failure to comply with the internal procedures on health and safety issues, principles approved by the Group\u2019s Human Rights Policy;\n- \u201cFraud/misappropriation\u201d to the detriment of the Company.\n\nIn addition to having adopted disciplinary measures and/or sanctions against the responsible parties, during the year training and awareness initiatives implemented by the companies of the Enel Group continued in order to promote behaviors that are in line with the adopted Code of Ethics and policies, which include the events organized in the South American countries to disseminate a culture of integrity and ethics in the Company (\u201csemana etica\u201d).\n\nEnel Global Compliance Program (\u201cEGCP\u201d)\n\nIn September 2016, Enel approved the Global Compliance Program, targeted toward the foreign companies in the Group, which is a governance tool aimed at strengthening the Group\u2019s ethical and professional commitment to preventing offences committed internationally that might result in corporate criminal liability and reputational risks. The identification of the relevant types of offences in the Enel Global Compliance Program \u2013 which is associated with the provision of behavioral standards and areas to be preventively monitored \u2013 is based on illicit conduct generally considered as such in most parts of the countries, such as, for example, offences of corruption, crimes against the public administration, fraudulent accounting, money laundering, offences committed in violation of the regulations on safety at work, environmental offences, etc.\n\nOrganizational and Management Model pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/01\n\nItalian Legislative Decree 231 of June 8, 2001 introduced an administrative (essentially criminal) liability into the Italian legal system for companies in respect of certain types of offences committed by directors, managers, or employees in the interest of or for the benefit of the companies concerned. Already in 2002, Enel \u2013 the first in Italy \u2013 adopted an Organizational and Management Model that meets the requirements of Legislative Decree 231/01 (Model 231). Since then, it has been constantly updated in line with the reference regulatory framework and current organizational context.\n\nActive and passive fight against corruption\n\nIn compliance with the 10th Global Compact principle, according to which \u201ccompanies are committed to combating corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery\u201d, Enel intends to pursue its commitment to fighting corruption in all its forms \u2013 whether direct or indirect \u2013 by applying the principles expressed in the pillars of its Anti-Bribery Management System.\n\nEnel\u2019s Anti-Bribery Management System (ABMS) is based on the Group\u2019s commitment to fighting corruption by applying the criteria of transparency and conduct as set out in the Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan (ZTC Plan) and confirmed in the Anti-Bribery Policy adopted in compliance with international standard ISO 37001:2016 (on anti-bribery management systems).\n\nTogether with the ZTC Plan, the pillars underpinning the ABMS are:\n\n- the Code of Ethics;\n- models to prevent the main criminal risks (for example, bribery in relations with public administrations and among private individuals, environmental offences, corporate offences and, for Italian companies, manslaughter, severe personal injury or grievous bodily harm committed in violation of the rules on the protection of occupational health and safety), as described by the\napplicable regulations on corporate responsibility (i.e. \u201cCompliance Program\u201d) in the various countries where the Group operates (for example, Organizational Model 231 for Italian companies, the \u201cModelo de prevenci\u00f3n de riesgos/Programa de Integridade\u201d for Group companies in Spain and South America);\n\n\u2022 the Enel Global Compliance Program (\u201cEGCP\u201d), a governance tool aimed at strengthening the Group\u2019s ethical and professional commitment to preventing offences committed outside Italy that might result in corporate criminal liability and reputational risks. The EGCP applies to the Group\u2019s non-Italian companies and supplements any compliance programs adopted by the same companies, in compliance with local regulations.\n\nThe mentioned governance measures (in relation to which we refer you to the specific section of the website), together with the current body of procedures, outline an effective prevention system, which is an integral part of the Group\u2019s Internal Control System.\n\nIn 2022 the Audit Function plan included the analysis of the suitability of the Internal Control system relevant for the purposes of the Anti-Bribery Management System for all Group Business Lines and the staff Functions; the specific audit work programs included verifications for the assessment of the risk and suitability of the design and operation of the controls, to complement the periodic activities on a sample basis as required by the Compliance Programs adopted by the Group companies.\n\nIn 2017 Enel SpA was among the first companies in the world to obtain certification of the conformity of its Anti-Bribery Management system to international standard ISO 37001:2016 (\u201cAnti-Bribery Management System\u201d). This certification was issued following an independent verification process, carried out by a primary accredited certification body, which was carried out in two separate phases, aimed primarily at certifying the adequacy of the design of the Enel Anti-Bribery Management System (in terms of governance, roles, and responsibilities, control procedures, etc.), and secondarily at assessing the level of application and effectiveness.\n\nAfter Enel SpA obtained certification ISO 37001 for its anti-bribery management system, it gradually extended the 37001 certification plan to the Group\u2019s main Italian and foreign subsidiaries, guaranteeing the maintenance of those already obtained.\n\nData protection\n\nProtection and processing of personal data are an important challenge for Enel in the era of digitalization and market globalization, and also a constant commitment to ensure continuous improvement of the service we supply to our customers.\n\nTo respond to this challenge in line with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679) (\u201cGDPR\u201d), in 2017 Enel set up a specific unit within the Legal Function (Data Protection Office) and appointed the data supervisors (\u201cData Protection Officer\u201d \u2013 DPO). The DPOs are appointed based on their professional skills and knowledge, and their ability to carry out the assigned tasks in accordance with the principle of independence. The Data Protection Office is structured as follows:\n\n\u2022 Data Protection Governance: a unit that monitors the evolution of data protection legislation and defines the Group\u2019s compliance. The office also carries out the role of DPO in countries in which the creation of a local Data Protection Office is not necessary;\n\n\u2022 Data Protection Staff Holding, Global Procurement and Global Digital Solutions: a unit that promotes privacy by design from phase of process planning at the global level and ensures consistent development at the national level;\n\n\u2022 Data Protection Global Business Lines and Global Customer Operations: a unit that supports the Global Business Lines in compliance concerning data protection, and monitors the evolution of data protection certification mechanisms for products and services;\n\n\u2022 Country units: units that monitor the evolution of regulations on a local level and support the local Business Lines as regards compliance related to data protection.\n\nIn 2020 country units were set up in Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru), alongside the European area units already in place (Italy, Portugal, Romania, Spain).\n\nThe Enel Group has developed a global compliance program on personal data protection, founded on the principles of the main privacy regulations, including the GDPR, the Brazilian law Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais (\u201cLGPD\u201d), the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), as well as the local legislation of the countries in which the Group operates. This compliance program is translated into a global policy on personal data protection, which defines the privacy principles applicable to all Group companies.\n\nIn particular, the Data Protection Office implements processes and activities in compliance with the indications of legislation concerning personal data protection and is committed to drawing up data protection agreements and clauses; planning data governance and corporate policies; providing consulting in line with the principles of privacy by design and by default; ensuring adequate risk manage-\nment and monitoring the consistency of data protection policies within the organization; as well as performing periodic and regular training and awareness campaigns for personnel on the main Data Protection issues.\n\nFurthermore, the Audit Function includes specific activities in their work programs targeted toward evaluating the Internal Control System on Data Protection Risk Management and on compliance with GDPR: analysis activities are planned in various geographical areas, also those not subject to GDPR, that aim to evaluate the safety measures in systems that contain personal data, commercially-sensitive data and employees data managed in HR processes. In order to guarantee full and effective protection of personal data, the Group has adopted a digital platform (Data Protection Platform), which is able to ensure digital compliance, through the use of the following tools, based on the size and complexity of Enel:\n\n- **Processing register**, which integrates the registers of the data controller and the data processor on a single platform, guaranteeing the dynamic mapping of the processing activities and their life cycle, as well as the fulfillment of the obligations required by the regulation. For the Enel Group, this tool also represents an essential resource for designing and monitoring intra-group dynamics;\n- **Privacy by Design**, which makes it possible to create every new project, from the beginning, in line with the principles regarding privacy;\n- **DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment)**, which makes it possible, not only, to perform an evaluation of the effective risks for the freedom and rights of the data subjects and to monitor the current risk of each processing operation that is changed in light of the implementation of a remedy plan;\n- **DTIA (Data Transfer Impact Assessment)**, which makes it possible to evaluate the transfer risk that accounts for the methods by means of which the data is transferred, as well as the regulatory aspects of the country where this data is transferred;\n- **Data Breach Management**, which permits the structured and timely management of all possible incidents that involve multiple companies and countries, and the possibility to study these events in order to implement common prevention solutions;\n- **Analytics**, that, with the definition of precise KPI, makes it possible to continuously analyze, compare and monitor the data and processes processed by the companies. With specific reference to relationships with its suppliers, the Enel Group Code of Ethics and Policy on Human Rights expressly require suppliers to have a clear commitment and to respect the main obligations required by the applicable privacy regulation. Furthermore, a specific clause in the Group\u2019s General Contract Conditions extends the principles of the Enel privacy policies to all suppliers, requiring them to be committed to handing personal data in compliance with the obligations imposed by industry legislation. In 2022, the Group\u2019s companies handled more than 19,105 communications concerning personal data protection from customers, of which: (i) 595 in Romania, (ii) 5,009 in Iberia, (iii) 13,376 in Italy and (iv) 125 in Latin America. Furthermore, the same companies collaborated with the national authorities, receiving 134 requests for information and clarifications, of which: (i) 2 in Romania, (ii) 105 in Iberia, (iii) 5 in Italy and (iv) 22 in Latin America.\n\n**Procedures started by competent Supervisory Authorities**\n\nWith specific reference to Italy, on March 8, 2021, the Data Protection Authority started a procedure, based on some reports from consumers, for the adoption of corrective measures and sanctions against the Servizio Elettrico Nazionale (SEN) for presumed violations of privacy regulations, in particular due to the performance of undesired phone calls and the wrongful provision of personal data (POD, supply address, tax code, etc.) to unauthorized parties for the promotional purposes of third parties. SEN has filed a statement of defence, contesting the charges. On April 26, 2021 a hearing was held at the Authority and a decision is pending.\n\nFurthermore, on January 18, 2022, the Data Protection Authority issued an order against Enel Energia, imposing a fine for approximately 26 million euros on the Company for asserted violations of the privacy regulations. In particular, the Authority contested the inadequacy of Enel Energia\u2019s surveillance and control activities for the internal data processing processes, within the scope of telemarketing activities, as well as the failed adoption of a comprehensive and effective action to contrast the undesired phone calls. The penalty, which also imposed a series of prescriptive measures, was contested by Enel Energia on February 9, 2022 before the Civil Court of Rome which, with an order dated March 20, 2022, ordered the immediate suspension of its effects. On February 15, 2023, the Court of Rome fully upheld Enel Energia\u2019s appeal and, as a result, canceled the penalties issued by the Authority. The publication of the reasons is pending.\n\nFurthermore, during 2022, the Data Protection Authority carried out two inspections, the first concerning e-distribuzione, regarding the handling of personal data within the scope of the so-called \u201cIndemnification system\u201d, which ended with the dismissal of the proceedings, and the second concerning Enel Energia, targeted toward acquiring information on marketing and telemarketing activities carried out by agencies on behalf of the company.\nIn 2022, in Spain the local control Authority, based on complaints presented by the data subjects, started 63 administrative proceedings against Endesa Energ\u00eda SA, Endesa X Servicios SL, Edistribuci\u00f3n Redes Digitales SL and Energ\u00eda XXI Comercializadora de Referencia SL. Many of these proceedings have been dismissed and, in the majority of the cases, the events that triggered the complaints were resolved thanks to out-of-court settlements. During 2022, Endesa Energ\u00eda SA received two penalties equal respectively to 50,000 and 40,000 euros, issued due to the conclusion of contracts without the consent of the data subject.\n\nIn Portugal, in 2022, the local control Authority started 23 proceedings against Endesa Energ\u00eda SA \u2013 Sucursal Portugal, as a result of sending direct marketing communications to data subjects without their valid prior consent. Endesa presented their defence against these proceedings and is waiting for the decision of the local Authority. With regard to prior proceedings related to marketing communications made in 2019 and 2020, for which Endesa has already presented its defence, in 2022 the Authority issued 18 judgments, two of which led to the dismissal of the proceedings, whereas the others issued penalties with an overall value of 96,000 euros.\n\nIn Romania, during July 2022, the local control Authority, after an investigation, issued a penalty equal to 49,337 lei (10,000 euros) against Enel Energie Muntenia SA for violation of article 32 of GDPR. The company has contested this penalty and is still waiting for the final judgement of the Authority.\n\nIn relation to Brazil, ENEL SP notified the local Authority about a data violation that took place in November 2020. This administrative procedure was dismissed without penalties by the Authority in August 2022. Furthermore, between 2021 and 2022, ENEL SP received 2 requests for information from the local Authority regarding 2 complaints from data subjects, for which the company presented the necessary clarifications and after which there were no further updates.\n\nIn Colombia, on February 10, 2021, the local control Authority started proceedings against Codensa due to the failure to observe the terms specified in the regulation concerning the online maintenance of the personal data of a data subject on the company\u2019s website. On February 23, 2021, Codensa filed an appeal regarding these proceedings. On November 25, 2022, the proceedings were dismissed due to lack of evidence sufficient for demonstrating the asserted violations of the local privacy regulation.\n\nData breach\n\nRegarding data breaches, during 2022, seven violations of personal data were recorded within the scope of the Enel Group.\n\nIn particular, in Italy, two violations of personal data were notified to the Data Protection Authority. As regards Enel Energia, the latter notified the Authority of a violation that occurred in April 2022, concerning the personal data of some customers caused by a hacker attack against the IT systems of a supplier of Enel Energia. The company provided the data subjects with the necessary information. The analysis carried out by Enel Energia showed that there was no abnormal use of the personal data and that the supplier then reinforced their safety measures. As regards e-distribuzione, the latter reported a data breach caused by the theft of IT equipment by unknown persons who entered the premises of a company suppliers. The analysis carried out by e-distribuzione did not find any abnormal use of the involved personal data.\n\nIn Spain, the company Endesa Energ\u00eda SA notified the local Authority of a data violation consisting in the publication of some advertisements in Facebook for the sale of the access credentials assigned to various suppliers for accessing some company applications, which resulted in fraudulent contracts without the consent of the data subjects.\n\nIn Colombia, the local control Authority was notified of four data breaches, three of which involving the unauthorized dissemination of personal data and one a ransomware attack (RansomHouse type) which affected the websites and activities of a supplier.\nTax transparency\nTax strategy\n\nSince 2017, the Enel Group has had a tax strategy understood as a set of principles and guidelines inspired by the values of transparency and legality and published online at www.enel.com. The Group\u2019s subsidiaries are required to adopt the tax strategy approved by the Parent Company, thereby assuming the responsibility for ensuring its acknowledgement and application.\n\nTax strategy objectives\n\nThe Board of Directors of Enel SpA (BoD) defines the tax strategy of the entire Group in order to ensure equitable, accountable and transparent tax contribution with the aim of ensuring uniform management of taxation for all concerned entities, which is inspired by the following logic:\n\n- correct and timely determination and settlement of taxes due under the law and implementation of the respective obligations;\n- correct management of the tax risk, understood as the risk of violating of tax rules or abusing the principles and purposes of the tax system.\n\nTax strategy principles\n\nThe tax strategy principles are the guidelines for Group companies, underpinning their business operations when managing the fiscal variable. The principles also require suitable processes to be adopted to ensure their effectiveness and application.\n\nValues: in line with its own sustainability strategy, the Group manages its tax assets in compliance with the values of honesty and integrity and is aware that the revenues deriving from levies represent one of the main sources of contribution toward economic and social development of the communities in the countries in which it operates.\n\nLegality: the Group pursues behavior oriented toward observance of the applicable tax provisions and is committed to interpreting them in order to respect not only their form but also their substance.\n\nTone at the top: the Board of Directors has the role and responsibility of guiding the promotion of a corporate culture that is based on the values of honesty, integrity and the principle of legality.\n\nTransparency: the Group is transparent to all stakeholders and actively collaborates with the tax authorities, enabling the latter, inter alia, to gain a full understanding of the facts underlying the application of tax rules.\n\nStakeholder value: the Group implements a sustainable business model, aimed at creating and distributing value to all stakeholders over the long term. Tax contribution is one of the key components of the value distributed to communities and is managed in compliance with the principle of legality and through active cooperation with the tax authorities in accordance with the principle of transparency.\n\nGovernance\n\nEnel SpA ensures that the tax strategy is acknowledged and applied within the Company through the governance bodies. Its interpretation is left to the Parent Company, through the Tax unit, which also manages its periodic updates.\n\nCompliance\n\nGroup entities must respect the principle of legality, by swiftly applying the tax laws of the countries where the Group operates, to ensure that the wording, spirit and purpose of the applicable tax rule or system are respected. In addition, the Enel Group does not engage in behaviors and operations, domestic or cross-border, that result in purely artificial constructions that do not respect economic reality and which may be reasonably assumed to offer undue tax advantages. This is because they are contrary to the purpose or spirit of the relevant tax provisions or system and generate phenomena of double deduction, deduction/non-inclusion or double non-taxation, including as a result of asymmetries between the tax systems of the different jurisdictions.\nIntercompany transactions\n\nIntercompany relations are structured at market prices and conditions, ensuring value creation in the locations where the Group conducts its business. For all intercompany transactions relevant to transfer pricing regulations, the Enel Group has adopted a policy that is in line with the arm\u2019s length principle, an international standard established by the Model Tax Convention and referred to in the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (hereinafter also referred to as the \u201cOECD Guidelines\u201d).\n\nTo this end, the Group has put internal policies in place to support the methods set out in the OECD Guidelines, which provide for the application of the Comparable Uncontrolled Price \u2013 CUP method (which compares the price of goods and/or services transferred in a transaction concluded between associated companies with the price applied in transactions between independent third parties). In addition, consistent with the applicable regulations, the signing of Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) with local tax authorities is promoted. These concern the definition of transfer pricing methods, the allocation of profits and losses to permanent organizations, and the application of rules regarding cross-border flows between Group entities.\n\nWith specific regard to intercompany financial transactions, the Enel Group has organizationally adopted a centralized finance model for its subsidiaries, which requires that the Group\u2019s two financial companies, Enel Finance International (EFI) and Enel Finance America (EFA), centralize part of the treasury and financial market access activities and act as the primary point of reference for the management of financial or liquidity needs generated by the operating entities.\n\nFinally, when analyzing the size of intercompany transactions, it can be seen that these account for a minimal percentage (generally around 7%\\(^{(1)}\\) of the Group\u2019s total aggregate revenues,\\(^{(2)}\\) due to the fact that the energy business is conducted almost entirely within the boundaries of the individual country, from the power generation process to market sales. In 2022, intercompany transactions as a percentage of the Group\u2019s total aggregate revenue amounted to approximately 4%.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) The average value shown is higher than the average value for previous years due to the results for the 2021 tax year, which, with the same number of intercompany transactions, saw an exponential growth in commodities and associated hedging transactions, with impacts on revenues, which led to an increase in this percentage to 9% in the reporting year.\n\n\\(^{(2)}\\) The calculation was carried out by comparing the revenues of cross-border intercompany transactions on the basis of the total revenues reported in the OECD CbCRs (Country-by-Country Reports) for the respective tax periods (i.e., 125,029 million euros in 2019; 108,165 million euros in 2020; 156,619 million euros in 2021, and 267,912 million euros in 2022).\nLow-tax jurisdictions\n\nThe Group does not make investments in or through countries considered to be tax havens for the sole purpose of reducing its tax burden. Such investments may only be proposed if they are supported by sound economic and strategic reasons and have the aim of developing the activities included in the Group\u2019s corporate purpose.\n\nTax incentives\n\nTax incentives are a key, development-oriented mechanism for economic policy, which countries use to stimulate growth and attract investment to support the national policy. The use of tax incentives generally determines a reduction in long-term tax payables (tax reduction) or else only the temporary deferral of the tax payment.\n\nThe Enel Group only uses widely applicable tax incentives for all operators and respects all specific regulations, where the incentives are in line with its industrial and operational objectives and are consistent with the economic substance of its investments.\n\nTax governance, control and risk management\n\nGovernance body\n\nEnel\u2019s organization model provides: i) for a constant flow of information to the Board of Directors by the Tax unit (\u201cTone at the top\u201d) with regard to the tax risk management and control system and the Tax Transparency Report, in which all relevant tax aspects of the Group are set out; ii) that the Holding\u2019s Tax Affairs unit has the task, among others, of implementing the Group\u2019s tax strategy defined by the Board of Directors, identifying, analyzing and managing the various optimization initiatives, monitoring the most significant tax issues, and providing support to the various Business Lines; iii) that in addition to the Holding Function, the Tax Affairs units in the different countries, acting in accordance with the values and principles set out in the tax strategy, are in charge of compliance management and tax planning and monitoring activities at the local level.\n\nOrganization\n\nEnel has adopted a set of rules, procedures and standards which are part of the Group\u2019s wider organization and control system and which are considered key points of reference that all parties, depending on their type of relationship with the Group, are required to observe. The various corporate policies and procedures applicable both at Group level and country level govern the activities, as well as their management procedures and Tax Affairs responsibilities, including in relation to other corporate Functions.\n\nThese documents are published on the Company intranet and are accessible to all Enel people. They form the general rules of conduct applicable within the Group when carrying out activities. Specifically in relation to taxation, in addition to the tax strategy there are specific organizational documents in force \u2013 both at global and local level \u2013 regarding the processes of tax compliance, tax planning, tax monitoring, transfer pricing and tax risk management. The general principle is that the Tax units must be of the\n\n(3) For example: Code of Ethics; Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan; Enel Global Compliance Program (EGCP); corporate policies, models and procedures: the tax strategy; the Internal Control and Risk Management System; the proxy system; the sanctions system referred to in the applicable CCNL, any other documentation relating to the current control systems; the relevant accounting standards; procedures and IT applications.\nappropriate size and equipped with the necessary skills to perform the role of a decision-making analysis center within the governance and business processes, in addition to the role of compliance oversight. For this purpose, specific and ongoing training initiatives on tax issues at both country and global level have been set up, with recurring meetings between all of the Group\u2019s Tax Managers in order to ensure appropriate alignment.\n\n**Tax risks**\n\nThe Group has a Tax Control Framework (TCF) the main aim of which is to provide the Tax units with a single and consistent set of guidelines for adopting a correct and effective approach to tax risk management within the Group. The framework sets out guidelines and methodological rules so as to assess, monitor and manage the relevant tax risk for the companies consistently, in accordance with the principles and guidelines set out by the tax strategy and Tax Risk Policy, and in the knowledge that the Group companies operating in different jurisdictions must adopt the TCF with respect for the specific corporate context and domestic regulations of each country in question.\n\nIn this regard, Enel has adopted a Tax Risk Policy the main objective of which is to provide unambiguous and consistent guidance to the Tax units when adopting the TCF at the local level.\n\nIn accordance with the established principles and guidelines, the Enel Group aims to manage the tax risk proactively and believes that adopting a TCF can ensure the timely detection, correct measurement and control of the tax risk.\n\nThe task of the TCF is to identify the sources of tax risk for the purpose of compliance and interpreting tax regulations, while mapping out the respective processes and activities in order to form a network of risk detectors, to be associated with the resulting control measures.\n\nIn particular, as the set of detectors and control measures identify sources of risk, the TCF can perform a broad spectrum of control. As such, any materialization of the tax risk can be intercepted and managed by each Tax unit in question. The effectiveness and ongoing updates of the TCF are ensured through periodic monitoring of the risk map, regular internal audit processes, as well as through the tax authority systems set out under cooperative compliance schemes (where implemented).\n\nThe results from the monitoring of tax risks are periodically brought to the attention of the competent Functions and corporate bodies, including to establish the most appropriate way to mitigate such risks.\n\nWhere applicable, the tax control system is subject to external certification, as in the case of Spain. In this regard, the subsidiary Endesa obtained certification by AENOR(4) for its Tax Compliance Management System in accordance with the requirements of the UNE 19602 standard. This tax compliance certification represents one of the highest standards by which Spanish companies can demonstrate that they prevent and mitigate tax risks by fully meeting the requirements of UNE 19602.(5)\n\nFinally, with regard to the outcome of this risk control activity and to potentially uncertain tax positions, please refer to the relative indications and comments in the Integrated Annual Report.\n\n**Participation in cooperative compliance schemes**\n\nFor companies that meet the legal requirements for participation, the Enel Group promotes participation in cooperative compliance schemes where they exist in the various countries in which it operates.\n\nIn particular, Enel participates in the Collaborative Fulfilment (Adempimento Collaborativo) scheme in Italy.(6) for larger companies, in the equivalent Code of Good Tax Practices (C\u00f3digo de Buenas Pr\u00e1cticas Tributarias(7)) scheme in Spain and is collaborating with the federal tax authority in a pilot project for the creation of a local Cooperative Tax Compliance model (Projeto CONFIA \u2013 Conformidade Cooperativa Fiscal) in Brazil.(8) In addition to the above-mentioned countries, various activities are under way for potential accession to additional cooperative compliance schemes.\n\n---\n\n(4) AENOR (Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Normalizaci\u00f3n y Certificaci\u00f3n) is a leading body in the certification of management systems, products and services and is responsible for the development and dissemination of UNE standards.\n\n(5) UNE standard 19602, published in February 2019, sets out requirements and guidelines for companies to voluntarily adopt a system that reinforces tax compliance best practices. The standard requires companies to identify and assess potential tax risks and to minimize them by establishing financial controls and due diligence processes for the organization\u2019s exposed personnel and suppliers, as well as a channel for complaints and consultations.\n\n(6) https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/portale/web/guest/schede/agevolazioni/ regime-di-adempimento-collaborativo/elenco-societa-ammesse-al-regime.\n\n(7) https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/collaborar-agencia-tributaria/relacion-cooperativa/foro-grandes-empresas/codigo-buenas-practicas-tributarias/adhesiones-codigo-buenas-practicas-tributarias.html.\n\n(8) https://www.gov.br/receitaFederal/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/acoes-e-programas/confia.\nIn order to monitor the progress of this activity, an index (the Cooperative Compliance Index \u2013 CCI) was developed to measure the participation of Enel Group companies in cooperative compliance regimes in various countries based on their size and membership requirements.\\(^9\\)\n\n**Mechanism for stakeholder reports**\n\nFor the Enel Group, tax compliance is considered a key aspect of the Company\u2019s ethical and accountable management. As such, breaches that can be reported through the Company\u2019s internal channels also include those relating to tax. The Group\u2019s Code of Ethics is the framework of \u201cethical management\u201d which Enel operates, tying in fully with the tax strategy. Provisions for violations of the Code of Ethics are appropriate to ensure the effectiveness of the requirements contained therein and should be understood to extend to the provisions of the tax strategy.\n\n**Transparent relations with stakeholders**\n\nThe constant commitment of the Enel Group to transparency with respect to the tax authorities and all stakeholders concretely underlines the importance it attributes to the tax variable and its role in the sustainable development of the Company. Therefore, the Group is committed to providing a transparent explanation of the tax issues that can be of interest to third parties, also on its website, making the latter an information hub that is easily accessible and understandable to all.\n\nThis commitment also extends to the Group\u2019s other listed companies. For example, Endesa has once again topped the best practice ranking for transparency and tax responsibility according to the Contribution and Transparency Report 2021 published by the Haz Foundation. Endesa has been ranked top among the IBEX 35 companies for its best practices in terms of tax risk management and control. Endesa also obtained the t*** transparency seal awarded by the Haz Foundation, which certifies compliance with twelve indicators analyzing various good practices in the area of fiscal responsibility. These awards demonstrate Endesa\u2019s solid commitment to tax transparency and responsibility in terms of economic and social contribution in the jurisdictions in which it operates.\n\nAdditionally, all stakeholders can send in their remarks, questions and opinions using the contact information channels provided by Enel and found on the website: [https://www.enel.com/media/explore](https://www.enel.com/media/explore) and [https://www.enel.com/investors/overview](https://www.enel.com/investors/overview).\n\nFinally, the Enel Group ensures transparency and integrity in its relations with the tax authorities in the event of audits on both the Group companies and third parties. To consolidate this transparency with tax authorities, the Enel Group promotes engagement in cooperative compliance schemes for companies that integrate the requirements of their respective domestic regulations in order to reinforce their relations. It also complies with the transfer pricing documentation provisions in accordance with OECD Guidelines, taking the \u201cthree-tiered approach\u201d, divided into Master File, Local File and Country-by-Country Report. Moreover, to avoid double taxation, the Group promotes Mutual Agreement Procedures (MAP) for the settlement of international disputes, which include the direct involvement of tax authorities from the contracting countries. Commitment to transparency is also reflected with regard to customs. In this regard, some of the most active companies in dealing with customs authorities (Enel Global Trading SpA and Enel Produzione SpA) obtained the status of Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) respectively in 2016 and 2015. Those qualified as an AEO are deemed to be trustworthy entities due to them having demonstrated an adequate level of compliance of their processes. Said qualification requires compliance with certain criteria, including \u201ccustoms and tax compliance\u201d, to be demonstrated and maintained through an appropriate level of control and training.\n\n\\(^9\\) The index compares the revenues of companies that have joined the existing cooperative compliance schemes to those of all Enel companies legally eligible to join. The index does not consider countries in which the schemes have not been legally established, or companies that do not meet qualifications to join (i.e., because their size is below statutory thresholds), even though the schemes exist in their countries. Nevertheless, the Group\u2019s overall coverage was more than 77% in terms of cooperative compliance companies\u2019 revenues compared to the Group\u2019s revenues.\nTax advocacy\n\nEnel consistently acts with a transparent and collaborative approach with all national and international institutions and trade associations to support the development of effective tax systems in the various countries where it operates. In particular, Enel supports fair, effective and stable tax systems in order to reduce uncertainty for both governments and companies. Enel believes that a transparent and coordinated approach between countries is essential to improve the international tax system and it supports a consensual approach to regulatory choices. To this end, it contributes by supporting governments and international organizations through active participation in public consultation phases on new regulatory processes, where they exist, either directly or through participation in various national and international associations.\n\nRegularly sharing knowledge and best practices through participation in national and international associations is essential in order to contribute to the development of new regulatory procedures by providing qualified technical support on complex business matters. In this respect, the most representative organizations in which Enel has been involved for years to support the evolving tax legislation are: Assonime,(10) EuropeanIssuers,(11) Confindustria(12) and Foro de Grandes Empresas.(13) It also participates in a CSR Europe project(14) for a collaborative platform on tax responsibility and transparency, with the aim of developing an index to assess the performance of companies from all sectors in terms of fiscal transparency and responsible fiscal behavior.\n\nIn 2019, Enel joined the European Business Tax Forum (EBTF), an association that aims to facilitate a public debate on taxation by providing a balanced and comprehensive perspective of the taxes paid by companies. In view of this objective, tax information and data are provided to the various stakeholders concerned. On its website (https://ebtforum.org), the Forum continuously publishes various studies on tax transparency: Total Tax Contribution,(15) Best Practices for Good Tax Governance(16) and Tax Transparency and Country-by-Country Reporting.(17) Furthermore, in 2021 Enel adhered to the B Team Responsible Tax Principles, that is, the principles developed by the B Team(18) for promoting responsible and sustainable tax practices for a better future. B Team is an organization created by a group of multinationals, with the contribution of civil society, investors and representatives of international institutions, in order to promote responsible and sustainable tax practices.\n\nThrough its active and public participation in all these associations, Enel believes it can make its own technical contribution by sharing its experience in support of fair, effective and sustainable taxation.\n\n---\n\n(10) https://www.assonime.it/Pagine/Home.aspx.\n(11) https://www.europeanissuers.eu/.\n(12) https://www.confindustria.it/home.\n(13) https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/colaborar-agencia-tributaria/relacion-cooperativa/foro-grandes-empresas.html.\n(14) https://www.csreurope.org/newsbundle-articles/csr-europe-launches-new-collaborative-platform-on-tax-responsibility-and-transparency.\n(15) Several studies have been published relating to the EU/EFTA Total Tax Contribution, which report the yearly aggregate data for the various types of taxes paid by the largest European multinational companies by turnover and/or by stock market capitalization, including in 2021 a dedicated section for Country-by-Country Reporting.\n(16) The paper was drafted by a group of tax directors from three organizations (Tax Executives Council of the Conference Board, The B Team and the European Business Tax Forum) to provide guidance on the best practices that multinationals can adopt in order to develop transparency and assurance vis-\u00e0-vis their stakeholders.\n(17) First study dedicated exclusively to Country-by-Country Reporting data.\n(18) https://bteam.org/.\nActing with honesty and integrity is one of the main cornerstones of Enel tax strategy, as is our commitment to transparency. The approach followed also aims to eliminate potential ambiguities that may derive from complex accounting and tax treatments, while supporting and, at the same time, improving other annual financial information and continuing along a pathway targeted at supplying an increasingly in-depth and clear vision of our tax position.\n\nAs of 2019 (FY 2018-2017), we have adopted a Total Tax Contribution model for the main countries where we operate, providing evidence of taxes paid and of withholding tax deductions. Beginning in 2021 (FY 2020), on the other hand, we adopted an integrated model: the Tax Transparency Report. This is prepared consistently with the rules provided for under OECD Country-by-Country Reporting and includes information and data for Total Tax Contributions in the main countries where we are present. The integrated model of the Tax Transparency Report is available on our site (https://www.enel.com). The Group believes that this model ensures a broad vision and a detailed measurement of the organization\u2019s contributions to economic and social development in the regions/countries in which it operates.\n\n**Tax Transparency Report \u2013 principles**\n\nThe Tax Transparency Report adopts the cash basis accounting criterion as a general principle for representing tax data, considering it to be the most adequate for disclosing the actual tax contribution. More specifically, the total tax data, as defined and detailed in what follows, is determined through the various taxes paid by all the entities in the scope of each tax jurisdiction in the year subject to reporting, regardless of the tax year to which the taxes refer. As anticipated previously, on applying an approach adopted by the OECD, the Tax Transparency Report classifies the different taxes into categories and distinguishes them between those that constitute an expense for the Company (taxes borne) and those that the Company pays due to rebate mechanisms, substitution etc. (taxes collected) but that, at any rate, are the result of the Company\u2019s own economic activities. Specifically, taxes, both borne and collected, are classified into the following five macro-categories.\n\n**Profit \u2013 Income taxes:** this category includes taxes on company income that can be both borne (e.g. tax on the income of companies at State or local level, taxes on production, solidarity contributions, tax levied on income deriving from specific activities such as the extraction of natural resources, the generation and sale of hydroelectric energy as well as taxes withheld at source) and collected, in the case where they are applied to a third party or to a physical person (for example, withholding taxes on interest income, royalties, subcontractors and suppliers). Income taxes do not include taxes on dividends paid by Enel Group entities.\n\n**People \u2013 Taxes on labor:** this category generally includes taxes on labor, comprising those on incomes and social welfare contributions. Taxes applied to the employer are considered taxes borne (e.g., social welfare contributions, health insurance, pensions, disability contributions), while income taxes applied to workers are considered as taxes collected (e.g., taxes on incomes of physical persons or social welfare contributions debited to workers that are normally withheld by the employer).\n\n**Products \u2013 Taxes on products and services:** indirect tax-\nes applied on production, sale or use of goods and services, trade and international transactions. This category includes taxes that can be paid by businesses with reference to their own consumption of goods and services, regardless of the fact that they are paid to the supplier of the goods and services rather than directly to the government. This category includes both taxes borne (e.g., taxes on consumption, turnover taxes, excise duties, customs duties, import duties, taxes on insurance contracts, non-deductible VAT) as well as taxes collected (e.g., VAT paid, excise duties, taxes on goods and services).\n\n**Property \u2013 Property taxes:** taxes on property, the use or transfer of property, plant and equipment or intangible assets. This category includes both taxes borne (e.g., taxes on property and the use of real estate, capital tax applied on the increase of risk capital, taxes on the transfer, purchase or sale of assets, net equity and capital transactions, stamp duty, stamp duty for the transfer of real estate, stamp duty for the transfer of shares, taxes on financial transactions that imply loans or borrowings from a foreign source), and taxes collected (e.g., taxes on leases collected by the lessor and paid to the government).\n\n**Planet \u2013 Environmental taxes:** these include taxes and duties on energy products (including fuel for vehicles), on motor vehicles and transport services, and on the supply, use or consumption of goods and services considered harmful to the environment, as well as the management of waste, noise, water, land, soil, forests, biodiversity, wild animals and fish stocks to be paid by the entity. Examples of taxes borne: taxes on the value of the generation of electricity, taxes on the production of nuclear fuels and carbon tax. Examples of taxes collected: taxes on electricity, taxes on hydrocarbons and duties on gas and electricity. Furthermore, the financial-equity data represented follow the accounting requirements below.\n\n**Data source:** the data represented in the report are expressed on the basis of IFRS-EU accounting principles adopted by the Group and are at stand-alone entity level. Subsequently, these data are aggregated by tax jurisdiction. To take account of intercompany relations, the data are represented according to logic of aggregation by tax jurisdiction (that is, the country in which the entities are resident for tax purposes and where they enjoy fiscal autonomy) and not according to a logic of consolidation.\n\n**Entities within the scope:** falling within the scope of the report are all those companies consolidated using the full consolidation method or the proportional method (hereafter also \u201centity within the scope\u201d) on the basis of accounting principles used for the drafting of the Consolidated Financial Statements on the part of the Ultimate Parent Entity (Enel SpA). With reference to the list of companies in the Group and their activities, please refer to the specific prospectus in the Integrated Annual Report 2022.\n\n**Currency:** the report considers the euro as the currency of reference in that it is the one used by the Parent Company. Since IFRS-EU accounting data are extracted in local currencies, economic data (such as revenues, earnings before taxes, taxes accrued and taxes paid) have been converted into the euro at the average exchange rate of the currency, while balance sheet data (property, plant and equipment) have been converted into the euro at the exchange rate in force at year\u2019s end.\n\n**Third party revenues:** the sum of third party revenues accounted for by the entities within the scope in the pertinent tax jurisdiction in the reporting year. The term \u201crevenues\u201d is understood in the broadest possible sense to include all revenues, comprising those from extraordinary operations.\n\n**Cross-border inter-company revenues:** the sum of revenues from transactions carried out between entities within the scope resident in different jurisdictions in the tax reporting year, including income from extraordinary operations and excluding dividends.\n\n**Profit (Loss) before income taxes:** the sum of profits (losses) before income taxes generated in the year of reference and involving all entities within the scope in each tax jurisdiction. The Profits (Losses) before income taxes must\n\n---\n\n[23] With the exception of those recorded under environmental taxes (e.g. duties on gas and electric energy).\n[24] With the exception of those recorded under environmental taxes (e.g. duties on gas and electric energy).\n[25] The classification of taxes as environmental is based on the shared definition within the harmonized statistic framework developed jointly, in 1997 by Eurostat, the European Commission, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the International Energy Agency (IEA), according to which environmental taxes are taxes whose tax base is a physical quantity (or the proxy of a physical quantity) of an element that has a proven and specific negative impact on the environment (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Environmental_tax). All taxes on energy, transport, pollution and resources are included, whereas all taxes on added value are excluded. For further details, see Eurostat, \u201cEnvironmental taxes \u2013 a statistical guideline\u201d, para. 2.3 and 2.6 (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/5936129/KS-GQ-13-005-EN.PDF) e OECD: Special feature: Identifying environmentally-related tax revenues in Revenue Statistics (https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/52465399-en/index.html?itemId=/con tent/component/52465399-en#).\n[26] However, the companies consolidated using the equity method are excluded. Furthermore, the data of Permanent Establishments are reported in the jurisdiction of their operations and not in the jurisdiction of residence of associated companies. Therefore, the data of the latter do not include the data of the Permanent Establishment. Finally, all stateless companies of the Enel Group are flow-through entities incorporated in the same country in which income is imputed and is effectively taxed in the partner company (e.g. the United States).\n[27] See circular Assonime no. 1/2021. Gli obblighi di trasparenza in materia di tassazione nelle dichiarazioni non finanziarie secondo lo standard GRI 207 (Transparency obligations in the matter of taxation in Non-Financial Disclosures according to standard GRI 207), where it is clarified that it is possible to make reference to other sources (known as \u2018incorporation by reference\u2019) such as the Directors\u2019 Report in the Consolidated Financial Statements or in the annexes for the list of Group companies and their main activities, and the Directors\u2019 Report or other sections of the NFD with regard to information already contained therein on uncertain tax positions and on any other information relevant for the purposes of GRI 207.\n[28] Specifically, also included are (i) other income, (ii) all extraordinary income (e.g., capital gains from the sale of real estate, unrealized capital gains/capital losses and (iii) financial income (with the exception of dividends from other companies within the scope) or any extraordinary item. Revenues from income taxes (deriving from deferred tax liabilities or from tax consolidation) are excluded.\n[29] Revenues do not include payments received from other entities within the scope that are considered dividends in the tax jurisdiction of the payer.\nIncome taxes accrued for companies (current taxes): the sum of current taxes (i.e., for the year in progress) on taxable income in the reporting year of all entities within the scope in each tax jurisdiction, regardless of whether or not they have been paid. The data for these does not take account of provisions for tax debts that are not yet certain as regards either their amount or existence, of adjustment of current taxes for previous years and of prepaid and deferred taxes.\n\nTangible assets: the sum of net accountable values of tangible fixed assets resulting from the balance sheet, of all entities within the scope in each tax jurisdiction.\n\nNumber of employees and remuneration: the number of employees at the end of the period considering all the entities within the scope; conversely, as regards their remuneration, please see the Sustainability Report as well as the Tax Transparency Report.\n\nCapital: the accounting value of share capital as taken from the financial statements of all the entities within the scope.\n\nProfit reserves: this item represents the amount of net profit realized by the entities within the scope in each tax jurisdiction over the past years, net of dividends paid and any other reduction due to losses, capital increases, etc.\n\n(30) Consistent with the reporting criteria applied to Revenues, Profits (Losses) before income taxes are indicated net of dividends paid by the companies within the scope (as also indicated by the OECD in the report \u201cGuidance on the Implementation of Country-by-Country Reporting\u201d published in 2019 point II.7).\n\n(31) Tangible fixed assets do not include cash and cash equivalents, intangible assets or financial assets.\n\n(32) The introduction of the disclosure related to the \u201cCapital\u201d and \u201cUndistributed profit\u201d items in the Sustainability Report 2021 further enriches the Report content in relation to OECD CbCR. Furthermore, the introduction of this information, in particular that related to \u201cUndistributed profit\u201d supplements the disclosure with that required by the Directive 2013/34 (amended by Directive (EU) 2021/2101) on the topic of the publication of income tax information (the so-called public CbCR). This additional information provides the disclosure with this content in advance of what is required under Article 48-(8) of the above-mentioned Directive.\nIn 2022, the Total Tax Contribution (TTC), with respect to all the countries in which we operate, was 13,979.9 million euros. 2022 showed an increase in the total tax contribution of 2,514.4 million euros (+21.9%) compared to 2021. This trend is the result of an increase in both tax borne and tax collected and reflects the economic conditions of the market in question characterized by a significant increase in raw material procurement costs and a sharp rise in electricity and gas prices.\n\nIn this context, on an overall level, both revenue-related indirect taxes and, albeit more moderately, profit-, labor- and property-related taxes grew significantly. More specifically, an analysis of the total tax contribution data broken down into the five tax categories shows:\n\ni. a significant increase in taxes on products and services, mainly as a result of higher revenues due to the increased quantities of electricity and gas (especially in Italy and Spain) sold at growing average prices;\n\nii. an increase in environmental taxes, influenced by the extraordinary repayments received in 2021 in Spain. Net of this effect, environmental taxes have in fact decreased mainly due to the suspension/reduction of energy excise taxes adopted by the governments of some countries to cope with high energy prices;\n\niii. an increase in taxes on profits due to both the introduction of extraordinary levies on companies operating in the energy production and distribution sectors and the effects of mechanisms for payment on account and balance of income taxes; and\n\niv. an increase in property and labor taxes, consistent with the dynamics of the business, in which there are increasing levels of investment and staff remuneration.\n\nIn general, the value of taxes paid highlights once again the importance of the Group\u2019s tax contribution to the communities and the economic and social systems of the countries in which it operates, something which has become even more relevant as we face the challenges of the post-pandemic period.\n\nAn analysis of the tax contribution from a geographical perspective shows that the distribution of taxes paid is consistent with that of the revenues generated and the number of staff employed. Italy, Spain and Brazil together account for 85% of the tax contribution, around 84% of revenues and around 75% of employees.\n\nThe distribution of the total contribution in the various countries in which the Group operates is shown in the table below.\n\n---\n\n(33) The total tax contribution has been calculated considering the main countries in which the Group is present. These represent more than 99% of revenues and more than 99% of income taxes paid. For all the other countries, the income taxes have nonetheless been indicated in detail. The following countries are included: Italy, Spain, Brazil, Colombia, Portugal, Peru, Argentina, Romania, Chile, France, the United States, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Panama, Mexico, Greece, Guatemala, India, South Africa and Costa Rica.\n\n(34) It should be noted that refinements and changes to the scope of consideration have been introduced for the purpose of preparing this section of the document. The 2021 figures presented in this document may not coincide with that represented in the Enel Group\u2019s \u201cSustainability Report 2021\u201d.\n\n(35) In the majority of countries where Enel operates, Income Taxes are paid for the reporting year based on the historical values of the previous year (so-called \u201chistorical method\u201d). Therefore, the financial effects of the overall value of income taxes for the reporting year are fully recognized only the following year.\n\n(36) Net of the effect related to Russia, whose activities are effectively divested.\n### Total Tax Contribution per country (\u20ac/mil)\n\n| Country       | Total Tax Borne (cash accounting) | Total Tax Collected (cash accounting) | Total Tax Contribution (cash accounting) |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Italy         | 4,229.2                           | 5,929.1                               | 1,699.9                                  |\n| Brazil        | 2,071.8                           | 2,884.5                               | 812.6                                    |\n| Colombia      | 70.1                              | 471.0                                 | 400.9                                    |\n| Portugal      | 257.8                             | 265.0                                 | 7.2                                      |\n| Peru          | 96.2                              | 232.6                                 | 136.4                                    |\n| Argentina     | 166.8                             | 220.4                                 | 53.6                                     |\n| Romania       | 173.7                             | 202.7                                 | 29.0                                     |\n| Chile         | 61.3                              | 192.8                                 | 131.5                                    |\n| France        | 145.8                             | 154.2                                 | 8.4                                      |\n| USA&Canada    | 60.9                              | 138.8                                 | 78.0                                     |\n| Germany       | 113.9                             | 114.1                                 | 0.3                                      |\n| Netherlands   | 22.2                              | 45.6                                  | 23.4                                     |\n| Panama        | 5.5                               | 37.6                                  | 32.1                                     |\n| Mexico        | 17.3                              | 23.7                                  | 6.4                                      |\n| Greece        | 3.5                               | 21.7                                  | 18.3                                     |\n| Guatemala     | 5.6                               | 12.0                                  | 6.3                                      |\n| India         | 5.4                               | 6.9                                   | 1.4                                      |\n| South Africa  | 4.2                               | 4.4                                   | 0.1                                      |\n| Costa Rica    | 2.9                               | 4.3                                   | 1.4                                      |\nIn 2022, the Total Taxes Borne\\(^{(37)}\\) amounted to 4,778.0 million euros\\(^{(38)}\\), an overall increase of 695.9 million euros (+17.0%) compared to 2021. This increase affected all tax borne categories and especially taxes on products and services, environmental taxes and taxes on profits.\n\nThe payment of taxes on products and services increased by 318.5 million euros, due to higher payments in (i) Brazil (+185.6 million euros), mainly as a result of an increase in social taxes PIS (\u201cPrograma de Integra\u00e7\u00e3o Social\u201d) and COFINS (\u201cContribui\u00e7\u00e3o para Financiamento de Seguridade Social\u201d\\(^{(39)}\\)) following new clarifications provided by the competent authorities for the application of these taxes, and Spain (+114.1 million euros) where revenues increased as a result of rising electricity prices.\n\nThe payment of environmental taxes increased overall by 139.5 million euros. The largest increases were recorded in:\n\ni. Spain (+80.7 million euros) where, on the one hand, taxes paid relating to the \u201ccanon hidr\u00e1ulico\u201d (water tax) increased compared to 2021 (+270.6 million euros), a year in which extraordinary repayments\\(^{(40)}\\) were received, and on the other hand, payments relating to the \u201cImpuesto sobre el valor de la producci\u00f3n el\u00e9ctrica\u201d (tax on electricity production) decreased (-204.2 million euros), due to the suspension of this tax for the entire year;\n\nii. Italy (+41.2 million euros) as a result of paying the coal excise duty adjustments for 2021, due to higher consumption in 2021 compared to 2020;\n\niii. Chile (+16.0 million euros) due to the increase in electricity production.\n\nThe payment of income taxes has increased overall by 152.3 million euros. The largest increases were recorded in:\n\ni. Italy (+167.3 million euros) due to the introduction of extraordinary contributions charged to companies operating in the energy production and distribution sectors and higher advance payments made in 2022 compared to 2021 as a result of the method used to calculate the same\\(^{(41)}\\) and the inclusion of a new company in the scope;\\(^{(42)}\\)\n\nii. Spain (+95.3 million euros) due to both lower depreciation and amortization as a result of extending the tax life of certain production facilities and the payment of taxes\n\n\\(^{(37)}\\) Taxes borne are taxes that constitute a cost for a company.\n\n\\(^{(38)}\\) Taxes borne include, among income taxes, specific corporate income taxes of 1,799.8 million euros paid in 2022 and 1,723.3 million euros paid in 2021.\n\n\\(^{(39)}\\) The exclusion of the ICMS (\u201cImposto sobre Circula\u00e7\u00e3o de Mercadorias e Servi\u00e7os\u201d) from the basis for calculating the PIS (\u201cPrograma de Integra\u00e7\u00e3o Social\u201d) and COFINS (\u201cContribui\u00e7\u00e3o para Financiamento de Seguridade Social\u201d) on which Brazil\u2019s Federal Supreme Court (STF) ruled in 2021, was a controversial topic in the country and the subject of much debate in that year. In 2022, Enel revised its methodology for calculating PIS/COFINS taxes in light of new clarification provided by the competent authorities, which resulted in an increase in taxes paid.\n\n\\(^{(40)}\\) The repayment refers to the amounts paid during the period 2013-2020. Following a judgment of the Spanish Tribunal Supremo, the charge was repaid as it was declared non-applicable.\n\n\\(^{(41)}\\) In the case in question, the payments on account (calculated using the historical method and partly using the forecast method) made in 2022 increased due to an increase in taxable income between 2020 and 2021, as well as a higher expected income in 2022 than in 2021.\n\n\\(^{(42)}\\) Taxes on Enel Hydro Appennino Centrale, the company acquired in 2022, were paid in 2022.\nrelated to previous years, made following a restatement of the tax base; and\n\niii. Colombia (+18.7 million euros) due to an increase in taxable income of some companies related to an improvement in operating results.\n\nThis was partially offset by a reduction in taxes on profits in:\n\niv. Brazil (-63.7 million euros) due to both a change in the way some entities pay taxes during the year and a reduction in taxable income;\n\nv. Chile (-48.8 million euros) due to the reduction of taxable income caused by exchange losses;\n\nvi. Holland (-26.5 million euros) due to a reduction in taxable income in 2021, which, based on the historical payment mechanism, affected the taxes paid in 2022.\n\nThe payment of property taxes increased overall by 48.3 million euros. The most significant increases were recorded (i) in the United States of America (+22.5 million euros) due to the commissioning of new renewable energy plants, (ii) in Brazil (+18.5 million euros) as a result of certain financial transactions (discharge of foreign financial debts and capital contribution) subject to capital taxation, and (iii) in Italy (+3.9 million euros) due to the updating of the \u201ccanone unico patrimoniale\u201d (single property charge) introduced as of 2021.\n\n---\n\n(43) Some Brazilian entities changed the frequency of income tax settlement from annual to quarterly during the year. Following this change, taxes for the last quarter of 2022 were paid in January 2023, with a consequent reduction in payments by 2022.\n\n(44) 2021 was characterized by a debt restructuring operation as a result of which securities issued in the past were repurchased early, and new sustainability-linked bonds were issued, in line with the industrial objectives that the Enel Group has set for itself in terms of sustainability and decarbonization. The restructuring operation generated around 560 million euros in extraordinary costs.\nTotal Taxes Collected amount to 9,201.9 million euros, up 1,818.4 million euros (+24.6%) as compared to 2021. This increase is mainly attributable to higher taxes on products and services. Indeed, the taxes on products and services increased by 1,800.0 million euros. The largest increases were recorded in:\n\ni. Italy (+1,000.0 million euros), where in 2021, as a result of the first year of adoption of the so-called \u201cVAT Group\u201d \u2013 a measure that simplified a number of tax obligations \u2013 no payments on account had been made;\n\nii. Spain (+516.2 million euros), Portugal (+103.7 million euros), France (+61.4 million euros) and Germany (+49.9 million euros), due to higher revenues related to the increase in prices and sales volumes as described above.\n\nA representative global and concise index of the Group\u2019s tax contribution from a cash perspective is:\n\n**TTC Rate**\n\n64.7%\n\nThe Total Tax Contribution (TTC Rate) index provides a concise and complete measurement of the burden for all taxes that the business has effectively paid and is calculated as a percentage of taxes borne in relation to Earnings Before Taxes. In 2022, the TTC rate of 64.7% was higher than the average for the last three years (57.5%) mainly due to the increase in taxes borne already mentioned.\n\nAnother concise indicator of the tax contribution for business income is represented by:\n\n**Current income tax rate**\n\n68.1%\n\nAt Group level, in FY 2022 the Current Income Tax Rate, determined as the ratio of accrued corporate income taxes (3.0 billion euros) to profit before income taxes (4.41 billion euros), was 68.1%, higher than the average rate of the OECD Member States (23.1%).\n\nIn line with OECD best practice, the following tables show the figure for corporate income taxes paid on a cash basis and the figure for current taxes booked on an accrual basis country by country. Current taxes represent taxes calculated on the basis of income produced in the year following the tax rules of each country and normally deviate from taxes paid in the same year in so far as the definitive payment of the balance is made in the year following that in which they accrued. The trends of the two values are substantially destined to realign over time. In 2022, the current income taxes on a Group level were equal to 3.0 billion euros, whereas the income taxes paid were equal to 1.8 billion euros.\n\nThe significant value of current taxes and the difference between current taxes and taxes paid relating to 2022 is mainly attributable to the higher cost of current taxes recorded in Italy, related to the extraordinary contribution on high utility bills and solidarity contributions (approximately totaling 721 million euros). The upward effect on taxes paid will be evident in 2023 due to tax payments based on historical data.\n\n---\n\n(45) https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/it/por/te/web/guest/schede/istanze/costituzione-gruppo-iva/scheda-informativa-costituzione-gruppoiva.

This reconciliation is necessary given the different methods for drafting the Tax Transparency Report \u2013 which have been changed by the OECD rules for Country-by-Country Reporting \u2013 with respect to the principles adopted for the drafting of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n| \u20ac/mil | Items subject to reconciliation | Tax Transparency Report | Consolidated Financial Statements | Difference to be reconciled |\n|-------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|       | Third party revenues            | 170,151                 | 140,518                          | -37,633                     |\n|       | Earnings before taxes           | 4,411                   | 8,741                            | 4,330                       |\n|       | Tangible assets                 | 93,300                  | 88,615                           | -4,685                      |\n|       | Taxes paid                      | 1,800                   | 1,934                            | 134                         |\n\nThird party revenues\n\nThe deviations between the data given in the Tax Transparency Report and the data in the Integrated Annual Report 2022 are:\n\ni. Derivatives (-25,827 million euros): for the purposes of the Integrated Annual Report, derivatives are the responsibility of the companies that do not operate in the market (direct balance sheet accounting management) while in the individual financial statements of the countries that operate on the market they are recognized in the income statement;\n\nii. Financial income (-8,287 million euros): for the purposes of the Integrated Annual Report the financial data for financial income is entered in the financial statements on a specific line of the Profit and Loss statement that is different than the revenue item, which differs from what is requested by the OECD rules applied for the purposes of the Tax Transparency Report;\n\niii. Revenue from discontinued operations (-3,998 million euros): for the purposes of the Integrated Annual Report, the revenues related to Group components (branches, companies or geographical areas) that have been discontinued or classified as held for sale are stated in a single net amount on a separate line of the Profit and Loss statement, whereas for the purposes of the Tax Transparency Report these revenues are represented analytically among the results of the companies within the scope;\n\niv. Fair value of companies consolidated using the equity method (436 million euros): for purposes of the Integrated Annual Report, revenues related to impairment operations on companies consolidated using the equity method are included in the year results. For the purposes of the Tax Transparency Report, the results related to the companies consolidated using the equity method are excluded as these entities are not relevant;\n\nv. Dividends from companies consolidated using the equity method (-262 million euros): for purposes of the Integrated Annual Report, dividends received from consolidated companies are eliminated. These revenues are considered in the Tax Transparency Report;\n\nvi. Other consolidation adjustments made on the basis of the application of international accounting principles (305 million euros).\n\n| \u20ac/mil | Third Party Revenues \u2013 Tax Transparency Report | 178,151 |\n|-------|-----------------------------------------------|---------|\n|       | Derivatives                                   | -25,827 |\n|       | Financial income                              | -8,287  |\n|       | Revenues from discontinued operations         | -3,998  |\n|       | Fair value of companies consolidated using the equity method | 436 |\n|       | Dividends from companies consolidated using the equity method | -262 |\n|       | Other consolidation adjustments               | 305     |\n|       | Revenues \u2013 Consolidated Financial Statements   | 140,518 |\n\n(48) For the purposes of Country-by-Country Reporting (BEPS Project \u2013 Action 13).\n(49) For more details regarding the definition of discontinued operations, refer to the Integrated Annual Report.\n(50) Using the full, proportional and equity method.\n(51) These include the following specific situations listed by way of example only: (i) elimination of intercompany margins and gains, (ii) recognition of any negative goodwill following M&A transactions, (iii) capitalizations of financial expenses in cases of equity injection and (iv) adjustments to contracts with physical delivery stated at fair value.\nEarnings before taxes\n\nThe deviations between the data given in the Tax Transparency Report and the data in the Integrated Annual Report are:\n\ni. Impairment on shareholdings (3,326 million euros): the accounting records for equity investments consolidated with the full method do not have an impact on the Profit and Loss statement. These accounting records however involve a reduction in profit before taxes for the purposes of the Tax Transparency Report;\n\nii. Derivative management (1,467 million euros): for the purpose of the Integrated Annual Report, the accounting records related to the reversal of the Cash Flow Hedge reserve for a possibly different qualification of the derivatives between the stand alone view of the Company and that of the Group do not have any impact on the Profit and Loss statement. These accounting records however involve a reduction in profit before taxes for the purposes of the Tax Transparency Report;\n\niii. Company dividends measured at equity (-262 million euros): for the purposes of the Integrated Annual Report, dividends received from consolidated companies are eliminated. These revenues are considered in the Tax Transparency Report;\n\niv. Results from discontinued operations (-154 million euros): for the purposes of the Integrated Annual Report, the results related to Group components (branches, companies or geographical areas) that have been discontinued or classified as held for sale are stated as a single net amount on a separate line of the Profit and Loss statement, whereas for the purposes of the Tax Transparency Report these revenues are represented analytically among those of the companies within the scope;\n\nv.

Contrarily, the Tax Transparency Report recognizes the data for income taxes paid on the basis of information collected from the individual companies in the different tax jurisdictions, consistent with the rules laid down by the OECD for Country-by-Country Reporting. The deviation is due to the different methods of recognizing the data and to the principles to which they refer.\\(^{[54]}\\)\n\n| \u20ac/mil |  |\n|---|---|\n| Taxes paid - Tax Transparency Report | 1,800 |\n| Differences due to the use of the indirect method for the purposes of the statement of cash flows | 134 |\n| Taxes paid - Integrated Annual Report | 1,934 |\n\nTax Rate\n\nWith reference to the reconciliation between the theoretical and actual tax rate, reference should be made to the analysis contained in the Integrated Annual Report 2022.\n\n\\(^{[54]}\\) By way of example only, the differences in 2022 can be related to: (i) inclusion in the data of the Integrated Annual Report of the taxes related to dividends (excluded from the data in the Tax Transparency Report) and (ii) changes during the year in the scope of consolidation.\nAppendix\n\n5.1 Methodological note\n\n5.2 Sustainability Statement: performance indicators\n\n5.3 Content Index\n\nGRI\nSASB\nTCFD\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION GUIDELINES ON REPORTING CLIMATE-RELATED INFORMATION\nWEF\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE DISCLOSURE REGULATION (PAI)\nHUMAN RIGHTS\n\n5.4 Our position on and commitment to the European Taxonomy\nSince 2003 Enel has been publishing a Sustainability Report each year, at the same time as the Group Consolidated Annual Report.\n\nIn compliance with the requirements of Italian Legislative Decree 254 of December 30, 2016, \u201cImplementation of Directive 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 22, 2014, amending Directive 2013/34/EU as regards disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by certain large companies and groups\u201d, Enel has been publishing a Consolidated Non-Financial Statement (NFS) since 2017. The Sustainability Report will constitute Enel\u2019s NFS with effect from the 2019 financial year. Accordingly, from that financial year on, the NFS is no longer published as a separate document. This Report of the Enel Group at December 31, 2022 was therefore drawn up in compliance with Italian Legislative Decree 254/16 and the 2019 Budget Act and article 5 of the CONSOB Regulations adopted with Resolution no. 20267 of 18 January 2018 and it is a separate document with respect to the Report on Operations. The document is published in the \u201cInvestors\u201d section of the Enel website (www.enel.com).\n\nThe Sustainability Report 2022 is addressed to the Enel Group\u2019s stakeholders and is designed to present the actions taken in pursuit of the Group\u2019s sustainability goals and thus to respond to the legitimate expectations of all stakeholders, providing a complete overview of the most significant impacts on the economy, the environment and on the people of the Enel Group, including on human rights and how they manage these impacts.\n\nWith respect to previous years, the structure of this document has been redefined, providing an entire section on the materiality analysis in a specific chapter, \u201cMateriality analysis process and results for 2022\u201d and attaching a specific table linking the topics and information required by the European Regulation that regulates disclosures in the area of sustainable finance (SFDR, Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation) with content provided in this document, indicating the specific chapter of reference in the document. Furthermore, a separate section was prepared for reporting related to the just transition, in line with the main sustainability trains (see chapter \u201cOur commitment to a just transition: leaving no one behind\u201d).\n\nTo the extent necessary to ensure an understanding of the Company\u2019s activities, performance, results and impact, this document covers environmental, social, labor, human rights and active and passive anti-corruption topics that are material to Enel, in view of the Company\u2019s activities and characteristics, according to the process described below (see the chapter \u201cMateriality analysis process and results for 2022\u201d).\n\nThe following table shows the areas required by Italian Legislative Decree 254/16, specifying the document chapter in which they are discussed.\n\n---\n\n**Enel SpA**\n\n**Innovability\u00ae Function (Innovation and Sustainability)**\n\n**Sustainability Planning and Performance Management and Human Rights**\n\nViale Regina Margherita, 137\n00198 Rome \u2013 Italy\nTel +39 06 83051\nE-mail sustainability@enel.com\nWeb https://www.enel.com/it/investors1\n| Topic of the Report/Italian Legislative Decree 254/16 | Topic of the materiality analysis | Report chapter | Risks | Policies and management models | Activities and results |\n|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------|-------|-------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Environment                                          | Decarbonization of the energy mix | Zero emissions ambition | \u201cZero emissions ambition\u201d chapter | \u201cZero emissions ambition\u201d chapter | \u201cZero emissions ambition\u201d chapter |\n|                                                      | Conservation of ecosystems and environmental management | Conservation of natural capital | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter | \u201cConservation of natural capital\u201d chapter | \u201cConservation of natural capital\u201d chapter |\n| Social                                               | Engaging global and local communities | Engaging communities | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter | \u201cEngaging communities\u201d chapter | \u201cEngaging communities\u201d chapter |\n|                                                      | Sustainable supply chain | Sustainable supply chain | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter | \u201cSustainable supply chain\u201d chapter | \u201cSustainable supply chain\u201d chapter |\n| Employment and labor-related                         | People management, development and motivation | Empowering Enel people | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter | \u201cEmpowering Enel people\u201d chapter | \u201cEmpowering Enel people\u201d chapter |\n|                                                      | Occupational health and safety | Occupational health and safety | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter | \u201cOccupational health and safety\u201d chapter | \u201cOccupational health and safety\u201d chapter |\n| Human rights                                         | Sound governance and fair corporate conduct | People management, development and motivation | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter | \u201cManaging human rights\u201d and \u201cSound governance\u201d chapters | \u201cManaging human rights\u201d and \u201cSound governance\u201d chapters |\n|                                                      | Engaging global and local communities | Managing human rights | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter | \u201cManaging human rights\u201d and \u201cSound governance\u201d chapters | \u201cManaging human rights\u201d and \u201cSound governance\u201d chapters |\n|                                                      | Conservation of the ecosystems and environmental management | Sound governance | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter |\n|                                                      | Sustainable supply chain | | | | |\n| Active and passive fight against corruption          | Sound governance and fair corporate conduct | Sound governance | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter |\nHow this document has been constructed\n\nThe Sustainability Report 2022 was prepared in compliance with the reporting standards \u201cConsolidated set of GRI Standards\u201d defined by GRI in 2021 with the inclusion of the GRI Universal Standard 2021, and also considering the Electric Utilities Disclosure supplement dedicated to the sector issued in 2013, also by GRI and still applicable today.\n\nMoreover, for comprehensive reporting in relation to the material topics identified following the materiality analysis, the directors deemed it necessary to include several additional disclosures, as more fully specified in this document. This information, in compliance with standard GRI 1: Fundamental Principles 2021, the disclosures in question were subjected to the same technical rigor required by the reporting standard adopted. The reporting standards adopted, as described above, comply with the disclosure obligations pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 254/16 art. 1 letter \u201cf\u201d and art. 3, par. 3, which the directors decided to adopt organically in order to fully represent the social and environmental topics \u2013 in compliance with the mentioned decree \u2013 of significance for the Enel Group in consideration of the Group structure, the specific business sectors, and the reference geographical areas.\n\nFurthermore, the Appendix to the Sustainability Report contains specific tables of reconciliation with indicators proposed by the WEF white paper \u201cToward Common Metrics and Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation\u201d and with the indicators proposed by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB \u2013 in relation to Enel\u2019s core business area in the Electric Utilities & Power Generators Sector) as well as a specific table linking the topics and information related to the protection of human rights and the Group\u2019s Human Rights Policy. Starting from 2022, a specific table is attached that links the topics and information required by the European Regulation that regulates disclosures in the area of sustainable finance (SFDR). The Sustainability Report 2022 also responds to the qualitative indications of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework; the alignment is pointed out in the TCFD Content Index, which includes the section of the financial statements that cover the qualitative disclosure requests of the TCFD and European Community Climate Guidelines.\n\nThe Sustainability Report is part of the Enel corporate reporting system, and the information it provides is more detailed than and supplementary to the annexed documents cross referenced in the Report. The non-financial information to be presented within the various corporate reporting system documents is selected based on the materiality analysis results and considering the approach set down in \u201cReporting on enterprise value\u201d, released in December 2020 by the main reference international organizations (CDP, CDSB, GRI and SASB). In particular, the content formulation process was based on the principles of relevance (or \u201cmateriality\u201d), stakeholder inclusivity, sustainability context and completeness of the data and information: Enel provides concise information on its performance in specific sections of the Sustainability Report (see \u201cOur sustainable progress\u201d and \u201cOur performance\u201d), these chapters contain descriptions also of the goals and associated progress referred to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), in order to provide full disclosure of all relevant information in the reporting period, together with reliable estimates for the future. The quality of information reported is assured by proceeding in compliance with the principles of accuracy, balance, clarity, completeness, sustainability context, timeliness, and verifiability.\nThis report is also compliant with the AccountAbility AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard (AA1000SES), and took into account the draft of the EFRAG (European Financial Reporting Advisory Group) \u2013 General Requirements prepared by EFRAG, as well as the Value Reporting Foundation \u2013 SASB standard. Finally, the main UN SDGs are referenced in the various chapters, in accordance with the instructions in \u201cLinking the SDGs and the GRI standards\u201d published by GRI in January 2021, and SDG Compass, the guide published in November 2015 and developed by GRI, UN Global Compact and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to help companies align their strategies with the SDGs and measure and manage their contribution to the goals.\nReconciliation of the topics of the materiality analysis and GRI Standards\n\nThe materiality analysis carried out in compliance with standard GRI 3: 2021 materiality topics made it possible to identify the material topics for the Company. The table contains the codes for the material topics identified with the GRI Standards or the \u201cAspects\u201d of the GRI supplement dedicated to the electric utilities sector (\u201cElectric Utilities Sector Disclosures\u201d) of reference, along with an indication of the context internal and external to the organization and the limitations on the scope, and is provided in the chapter \u201cMateriality analysis process and results for 2022\u201d.\n\nThe reporting process\n\nThe structure of the Sustainability Report 2022 was developed in accordance with the materiality analysis, focusing more closely on the material topics covered in detail in the dedicated chapters. Likewise, the materiality level of the topics \u2013 divided in turn into dedicated sub-topics \u2013 influenced the level of detail with which to treat each subject and report the associated GRI indicators (GRI Standards and Electric Utilities Sector Disclosure) and also the choice of the most appropriate tools to represent them (2022 Integrated Annual Report and appended reports), to which reference was made for the treatment or detailed investigation of more specific topics, respectively, of economic performance and governance. The materiality analysis also formed the basis for definition of Enel\u2019s sustainability goals for the 2023-2025 period, as illustrated by the Sustainability Plan (see chapter \u201cWe empower sustainable progress\u201d). The GRI Context Index, included in the Appendix, contains references to the 2022 Sustainability Report and the Group\u2019s other reporting instruments. Please also consult the website www.enel.com for further information, for example regarding innovation projects or the activities of Enel\u2019s foundations and the 2022 Informe de Sostenibilidad by Endesa and Enel Am\u00e9ricas for additional details concerning initiatives dedicated to customers and local communities in Spain and South America.\n\nDrafting and assurance\n\nThe process of reporting and monitoring the Key Performance Indicators (\u201cKPIs\u201d) relevant to sustainability involves the Holding Company, with regard to transversal issues, and all Group Business Lines, Functions and companies for issues and indicators specific to the various sectors of activity. Those responsible for collecting, verifying and processing the relevant KPIs are identified within the units involved. The Sustainability Planning and Performance Management and Human Rights unit, which forms part of the Innovability\u00ae Function, is responsible for consolidating information and coordinating the entire 2022 Sustainability Report drafting process.\n\nOn March 28, 2023, the Report was submitted for analysis and evaluation by the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee and on April 5 to the Enel Control and Risk Committee. It was approved by the Board of Directors on April 6. The document will then be presented to the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting together with the Group\u2019s Consolidated Annual Report.\n\nThis Report has been subjected to a limited audit by and independent auditing company, KPMG SpA, engaged also to audit the Enel Group\u2019s Consolidated Annual Report. The limited audit was conducted in accordance with international standard ISAE 3000 (Revised) 1 and, accordingly, the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, including professional independence and verification of the absence of conflicts of interest that may affect the ethical principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and diligence, confidentiality and professional conduct. As of the 2021 financial year, the audit approach has been extended to include the comprehensive scrutiny (reasonable assurance) of a set relevant indicators, equal to 36 KPI for 2022 (25 KPI in 2021). This activity is aimed at obtaining greater security regarding the selected indicators as compared to indicators and other information subject to limited scrutiny and makes it possible to guarantee to the various stakeholders of the Sustainability Report greater reliability.\nof the topics and information it contains. The conclusions of the limited reasonable assurance activity are set out in the Mixed Audit Report on the Enel Group non-financial statement and on the selection of 36 indicators, issued in accordance with Art. 3, paragraph 10 of Italian Legislative Decree 254/16 in compliance with ISAE 3000 Revised, and in compliance with the provisions of the Consob Regulations and the guidelines issued by the professional bodies concerned (i.e. ASSIREVI). The said report, which contains a detailed description of the principles adopted, activities performed and conclusions reached, is attached hereto.

The Statement of the proportion of activities considered eco-sustainable (Art. 8, Reg. EU 852). The GHG Inventory Statements were audited by DNV GL, with a reasonable level of certainty for Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions, restricted to natural gas sales activities, and with a limited level of certainty for the other Scope 3 emissions included in the scope of application of the inventory. The audit was conducted according to ISO 4064-3 for compliance of greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories with the WBCSD/WRI Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol).\nThe information and data presented in the Report refer to Enel SpA and the companies within the scope of line-by-line consolidation at December 31, 2022, in accordance with the Group\u2019s financial consolidation scope. In addition to the line-by-line consolidation scope, the document also includes the data and information regarding the company Asociaci\u00f3n Nuclear Asc\u00f3-Vandell\u00f3s II AIE (ANA CNVII AIE), to which the two Spanish nuclear plants of Asc\u00f3 and Vandell\u00f3s are attributed. The company, considered to be a joint operation in line with the provisions of accounting standard IFRS 11, is included in the Group\u2019s financial scope of consolidation under the proportional method, and is included in this report using the same method to ensure the impacts are adequately represented, given that it is a significant Group entity. The sole exception to the line-by-line consolidation scope are the companies acquired in 2022, for which, on the basis of prevailing practice, as also represented in the Consob report of January 19, 2018, it was decided to begin consolidation, with regard to some of the areas covered in this document, with effect from 2023, in the light of the reduced acquisition period. The areas of exclusion have been indicated directly in the specific chapters.\n\nIn particular, the main organizational changes affecting the Enel Group in 2022 were:\n\n- completion of the acquisition of 527 MW of hydroelectric plants by Enel Produzione SpA;\n- acquisition by Enel X of 50% of Mooney Group SpA, and the subsequent sale to it of all the activities related to the lending services of Enel X in Italy, marketed with the Enel X Pay brand (Enel X Financial Services, CityPoste Payment, PayTipper and Junia Insurance);\n- sale of the entire investment held in PJ C Enel Russia completed on October 12, 2022, which involved the sale of all the electricity generation assets in Russia, which include approximately 5.6 GW of conventional capacity and approximately 300 MW of wind capacity in various stages of development;\n- completion of the sale of the electricity transmission business in Chile, through the sale of the company Enel Transmisi\u00f3n Chile SA;\n- finalization of the sale of 50% of Gridspertise to CVC;\n- completion of the sale of the electricity distributing company in the State of Goi\u00e1s in Brazil.\n\nFor more detailed information on the changes, refer to the 2022 Consolidated Annual Report in the sections \u201cMain changes in the scope of consolidation\u201d and \u201cSignificant events in 2022\u201d.\n\nIf the associated companies (measured at equity in the Consolidated Annual Report) and other entities over which Enel exercises significant influence (including joint ventures) produce substantial impacts, for the purpose of the content of the present document, they are included in the data calculation in proportion to Enel\u2019s holding, and specific disclosure is referenced in the text. We invite you to refer to the 2022 Consolidated Annual Report for details of the companies included the scope of consolidation.\n\nIn this Statement, the terms \u201cCorporate\u201d, \u201cHolding Company\u201d and \u201cParent Company\u201d refer to Enel SpA, whereas \u201cGroup\u201d, \u201cEnel\u201d and \u201cCompany\u201d refer to Enel SpA and its subsidiaries.\n\nVarious deviations from the KPIs and information included in the 2021 Sustainability Report are the result of changes in the Group\u2019s scope of consolidation. The effects of changes in the scope of consolidation, together with any significant changes or limitations of the scope or methods of calculating individual indicators compared with 2021, are expressly indicated in the text and/or the Appendix, along with the effects on the related data. See the notes in the tables in the Appendix for all further details regarding adjustments with respect to already published data, calculation methods, assumptions or significant limitations of indicators.\n\nThe data have been thoroughly calculated on the basis of the results of Enel\u2019s accounting, non-accounting and other information systems, and validated by the persons responsible in each case. Data determined through the use of estimates and related calculation method have been expressly indicated. In the comparison of the data over time, it should be noted that differences between 2022 and 2021, in absolute and percent terms, have been calculated considering decimal places in some cases not visible in the printed document. In the tables containing quantitative data, percent changes in excess of |100%| are indicated by \u201c-\u201d.\n\n---\n\n(1) A \u201cjoint operation\u201d is a joint-control arrangement in which the parties that hold joint control have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities associated with the arrangement.\n\n(2) Illustrative report on the results of the consultation and the consequences for regulation, the activities of companies and operators and the interests of investors and savers.\nPerformance indicators\n\nKey sustainability performance indicators are presented from page 457 to page 499 and form an integral part of this Sustainability Report.

The specific emissions were calculated considering total direct emissions (Scope 1) in relation to total renewable, nuclear and thermoelectric generation, including the contribution of heat and excluding pumped storage generation. The 2021 figures include a more specific determination thereof. The emissions from the supply chain consider an intensive value equal to: 889, 968, 969 tCO2eq/M\u20ac spent in 2022, 2021, 2020 respectively. The estimate of the emissions from the extraction and transport of natural gas consider the share of gas both used in thermal power plants and sold in the retail market. The emissions from the supply chain consider an intensive value equal to: 889, 968, 969 tCO2eq/M\u20ac spent in 2022, 2021, 2020 respectively. The estimate of the emissions for the 3 years is based on the average value of the Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) or ISO CFP 14067 certifications received in the three-year period 20-21-22 for more than 60% of the supplies purchased. The remainder was estimated using international databases (Ecoinvent/Exiobase). Emissions from works have been estimated based on data from sustainable construction sites and emissions of services have been estimated using international databases.\n\n(5) The 2021 and 2020 values have been redetermined following a change in the methodology.\n\n(6) The specific emissions were calculated considering total direct emissions (Scope 1) in relation to total renewable, nuclear and thermoelectric generation, including the contribution of heat and excluding pumped storage generation. The 2021 figures include a more specific determination thereof.\n\n(7) The specific emissions were calculated considering total direct emissions of CO2 in relation to total renewable, nuclear and thermoelectric generation, including the contribution of heat and the pumped storage energy generation.\n\n(8) KP corresponding to the new target certified by SBTI in 2022. The specific emissions were calculated considering total direct emissions (Scope 1) related to the generation of electricity (including CO2, CH4, N2O) in relation to total renewable, nuclear and thermoelectric generation, including the contribution of heat and excluding pumped storage generation.\n\n(9) KP corresponding to the new target certified by SBTI in 2022. The specific emissions are calculated considering the combination of total direct emissions (Scope 1) related to electricity generation (including CO2, CH4, N2O) and the Group\u2019s direct GHG emissions (Scope 3) deriving from the generation of electricity purchased and sold to end customers, in relation to total renewable, nuclear and thermoelectric generation, including the contribution of heat and excluding pumped storage generation.\n\n(10) Avoided Group emissions are calculated as the sum of the avoided emissions in the various countries. The value is calculated as the product of the generation of electricity obtained from a renewable or nuclear source and the specific CO2 emissions from the thermoelectric generation of the country in which Enel is present (source: Enerdata, http://enerdata.net).\n\n(11) Mercury emissions in 2021 amounted to 75 kg, associated with thermoelectric generation for Italy, Spain, Russia and Chile, which account for almost 100% of coal-fired thermoelectric generation throughout the Group. This is in addition to the mercury emissions from the geothermal sector, amounting to 394 kg. In Europe, mercury emissions are declared to the competent authorities for registration in the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) in accordance with EU Regulation No 166/2006 and are subject to the relevant checks in terms of completeness, consistency and credibility (Article 2 of Regulation No 166/2006).\n\n(12) After implementing the new reporting criteria, the value of the indicator is available starting with 2022 reporting.\n\n(13) Specific water needs are constituted by all the water withdrawal quotas from surface (including recovered rain water) and groundwater sources, by third parties, from the sea and from wastewater (quota for third party procurements) used for processes and for closed-cycle cooling, except the quota of seawater discharged back into sea after the desalination process (brine). This latter item (brine) contributes to the quota of total withdrawals.\n\n(14) The total value of process and closed-loop cooling water withdrawals for years 2020 and 2021 was recalculated following the refinement conducted in 2022 of the way in which water withdrawal for cooling purposes at certain nuclear power plants in Spain was calculated.\n\n(15) Water stressed areas are defined as \u201cwater stressed\u201d areas those in which, on the basis of the classification provided by the WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, the ratio between the total annual withdrawal of surface water or groundwater for different uses (civil, industrial, agricultural and livestock) and the total annual renewable water supply available (\u201cbase water stress\u201d, understood, therefore, as the level of competition between all users) is high (40-80%) or extremely high (>80%). This category also includes the thermal plants that use \u201cfresh water\u201d. By way of greater environmental protection, Enel has also considered as located in water stressed areas those plants falling in zones classified by the WRI as \u201carid\u201d. The value for years 2020 and 2021 was recalculated following the refinement conducted in 2022 of the way in which water withdrawn for cooling purposes at certain nuclear power plants in Spain was calculated.\nThe quantity of waste produced by the O&M activities during 2021 and 2020 was recalculated in line with the new 2022 reporting objective, extending it also to the O&M waste produced by contractors who, working on behalf of Enel, generate waste that they manage under the own responsibility as a producer. Waste by significant geographical area is reported below:\n\n| KPI UM | December 2022 | December 2021 | December 2020 | 2022-2021 | % Scope |\n|--------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|---------|\n| Hazardous waste by significant geographical areas | | | | | |\n| Italy | (t) 29,061 | 29,306 | 28,116 | -245 | -0.8 Italy |\n| Iberia | (t) 13,857 | 11,786 | 11,116 | 2,071 | 176 Iberia |\n| South America | (t) 9,089 | 13,777 | 7,218 | -4,688 | -34.0 South America |\n| - Chile | (t) 1,093 | 741 | 408 | 352 | 475 Chile |\n| - Argentina | (t) 1,111 | 2,106 | 1,307 | -995 | -472 Argentina |\n| - Colombia | (t) 1,231 | 1,364 | 878 | -133 | -9.8 Colombia |\n| - Peru | (t) 1,142 | 905 | 741 | 237 | 26.2 Peru |\n| - Brazil | (t) 4,500 | 8,658 | 3,884 | -4,158 | -48.0 Brazil |\n| - other | (t) 12 | 3 | - | - | - Other |\n| Europe | (t) 3,733 | 9,254 | 5,225 | -5,521 | -59.7 Europe |\n| Russia | (t) 1,924 | 7,368 | 2,660 | -5,444 | -73.9 Russia |\n| Romania | (t) 1,802 | 1,859 | 2,550 | -757 | -3.1 Romania |\n| Greece | (t) 7 | 27 | 14 | -20 | -74.1 Greece |\n| Bulgaria | (t) - | - | 1 | - | - Bulgaria |\n| Other | (t) 199 | 243 | - | - | - Other |\n| Non-hazardous waste by significant geographical areas | | | | | |\n| Italy | (t) 2,735,469 | 2,445,104 | 1,657,160 | 290,365 | 11.9 Italy |\n| Iberia | (t) 201,380 | 220,506 | 315,963 | -19,126 | -8.7 Iberia |\n| South America | (t) 357,387 | 327,563 | 279,854 | 29,824 | 9.1 South America |\n| - Chile | (t) 97,520 | 120,645 | 138,464 | -23,125 | -19.2 Chile |\n| - Argentina | (t) 2,793 | 2,629 | 11,119 | 164 | 6.2 Argentina |\n| - Colombia | (t) 100,705 | 98,182 | 6,668 | 2,523 | 2.6 Colombia |\n| - Peru | (t) 30,039 | 19,397 | 33,016 | 10,642 | 54.9 Peru |\n| - Brazil | (t) 126,165 | 86,520 | 90,588 | 39,645 | 45.8 Brazil |\n| - other | (t) 165 | 189 | - | -24 | -12.7 Other |\n| Europe | (t) 6,140 | 14,969 | 15,567 | -8,829 | -59.0 Europe |\n| Russia | (t) 1,365 | 9,828 | 11,121 | -8,463 | -86.1 Russia |\n| Romania | (t) 4,775 | 5,134 | 4,440 | -359 | -7.0 Romania |\n| Greece | (t) - | 6 | 2 | -6 | -100.0 Greece |\n| Bulgaria | (t) - | - | 3 | - | - Bulgaria |\n| Other | (t) 389 | 393 | - | - | - Other |\n\n(16) The cabling ratio is calculated by proportioning the km of cabled lines (both underground and aerial insulated cables) to the total km of lines. The increase in the cabling ratio over the years is due to a general increase, in terms of length, of aerial and underground cable sections at the expense of the bare conductor line. The number of sites does not include nuclear plants. The hectares reported do not include hydroelectric basins. The impact assessment considered the active basins in terms of biodiversity. Compared with last year, KPI mapping and calculation tools were refined, which led to a slight change in the figure compared to 2021.\n\n(17) The number of sites does not include nuclear plants. Hectares reported do not include hydroelectric reservoirs. For the assessment of the impact, the active projects on biodiversity have been considered.

The category includes: mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, investment and merchant banks, insurance companies.\n\n(2) Calculated comparing the number of shares held by identified Socially Responsible Investors (SRIs) with the number of shares held by identified institutional investors.\n\n(3) SRIs are investors who state that they include environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in their traditional financial analyses in order to guide their investment decisions (inclusion of at least one ESG criterion and adhesion to the main international principles approved by organizations such as UNPRI, UKSIF, EUROSIF are among the key factors in order to classify an investor as an SRI).\n\n(4) Calculated as the difference between the valuation on the last open market day of the year and the valuation of the previous year.\n\n(5) Only requests received have been considered, not the responses provided.\n\n(6) Directors qualified as independent pursuant to the Single Financial Act and the Italian Corporate Governance Code (Edition 2020)\n\n(7) Of these, 12 meetings were held in 2022 on sustainability issues.\n\n(8) During the year, the verification of all the reports received in 2021 was completed: the number of confirmed violations for 2021 was therefore revised from 41 to 44. The three additional violations are to be ascribed to a case of conflict of interest and two cases of inappropriate behavior related to labor practices.\n\n(9) Corruption consists of the abuse of power with the goal of private gain and can be instigated by individuals in the public or private sector. It is interpreted here as including corrupt practices such as bribery, fraud, extortion, collusion, conflicts of interest and money laundering.\n## GRI Content Index\n\n### Statement of use\nEnel SpA has reported in accordance with the GRI Standards for the period 1 January 2022 \u2013 31 December 2022.\n\n### GRI 1 used\nGRI 1: Foundation 2021\n\n### Applicable GRI Sector Standard(s)\nElectric Utilities Disclosure 2013\n\n| GRI Standards | Disclosure | Location | Omissions |\n|---------------|------------|----------|-----------|\n| **GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021** | | | |\n| **The organization and its reporting practices** | | | |\n| 2-1 | Organizational details | Pg. 12-13, 390; 448; Sustainability Statement sec.

Specifically:\n\n- 9 violations relating to \u201cConflict of interest/corruption\u201d for the pursuit of personal interests or interests that harm the company;\n- 11 violations connected to inappropriate behavior by individual employees that is detrimental to respect for diversity and non-discrimination and the failure to comply with the internal procedures on health and safety issues.\n\nFor further information, please refer to the \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter \u2013 \u201cValues and pillars of corporate ethics\u201d and \u201cStakeholder reports\u201d sections.\n\n### 11. Lack of processes and compliance mechanisms to monitor compliance with UN Global Compact principles and OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises\n\nThe implementation and monitoring of the commitments expressed in the human rights policy adopted by the Enel Group are governed by a process, which, as required by the UN Guidelines and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct, aims to evaluate our procedures and operational processes and define, if necessary, an improvement plan to strengthen the systems that protect the principles set out in the Policy on Human Rights. This process is codified in a globally applicable internal procedure and involves \u201cidentifying, preventing, mitigating and reporting\u201d adverse effects potentially caused by the business. Specifically, it is divided into the following phases:\n\n1. assessment of the risk perceived by key stakeholders, at country level with reference to labor rights, local communities and the environment;\n2. gap analysis aimed at analyzing organizational and control systems to protect risks and identify any shortcomings;\n3. development of actions for the improvement plan aimed at addressing the gaps identified in the previous phase;\n4. Monitoring progress in the adoption of remedies.\n\nThe improvement actions highlighted by the process are included in the Group\u2019s Sustainability Plan and disclosure of the results of the analysis of perceived risk and gaps is provided annually in the Group\u2019s Sustainability Report, together with the progress made in the improvement plans.\n\nFor further information, please refer to the \u201cManaging human rights\u201d chapter, especially the \u201cAccess to remedies\u201d section and the \u201cHuman Rights Content Index\u201d.\n\n### 12.

Investments in companies without water management policies\n\nEnel is constantly committed to progressively reducing the specific need for water for its plants and assets, through the efficient use of water in existing thermal plants, the evolution of the energy mix towards renewables, and the progressive reduction of generation from fossil fuels. Starting this year, Enel has renewed and relaunched its commitment to conserving water resources by adopting a new target aimed at reducing specific withdrawal of fresh water. Please refer to the \u201cConservation of natural capital\u201d chapter, \u201cResponsible use of water\u201d section.\n\n### 8. Exposure to areas of high water stress\n\nEnel also pays particular attention to the vulnerability of the resource, by mapping and constantly monitoring all generation sites located in areas classified as water-stressed areas. Among the sites mapped, those defined as \u201ccritical\u201d are those positioned in water-stressed areas which procure significant volumes of fresh water. For these sites, which are specifically thermoelectric and nuclear plants that use water resources for process and closed-cycle cooling needs, water management methods and their process performance are constantly monitored, in order to minimize consumption and favor withdrawals from sources of lower quality or which are non-scarce (wastewater, industrial or sea water). Please refer to the \u201cConservation of natural capital\u201d chapter, \u201cResponsible use of water\u201d section.\n\n### 9. Investments in companies producing chemicals\n\nIndicator not applicable to Enel.\n\n### 10.

In any case, note that the final indicator requested cannot be directly communicated by Enel, as it is calculated by the investor. For further details, please refer to the \u201cConservation of natural capital\u201d chapter and to the Sustainability Statement, \u201cZero emissions ambition\u201d section.\n\n### 14. Natural species and protected areas\n\nProtection of biodiversity is one of the strategic objectives of the \u201cEnel Environmental Policy\u201d and is regulated by a specific policy adopted by Enel in 2015, the \u201cEnel Biodiversity Policy\u201d, renewed in 2023 following COP15. The policy defines the guidelines for all the Group\u2019s biodiversity protection initiatives and the principles according to which they operate, aligned with the Kunming-Montreal GBF. Please refer to the \u201cConservation of natural capital\u201d chapter.\n\n### 15. Deforestation\n\nEnel is committed to conserving forests and, if deforestation cannot be avoided, will reforest areas of equivalent value in line with the principle of \u201cNo Net Deforestation\u201d.

Share of securities not certified as green under a future EU legal act setting up an EU Green Bond Standard\n\nIndicator not applicable to Enel.\n| SOCIAL AND EMPLOYEE MATTERS |\n|-----------------------------|\n| **1. Investments in companies without workplace accident prevention policies** |\n| Our Group\u2019s commitment in terms of health, safety and work is set out in two documents (both signed by the CEO): \u201cDeclaration of Commitment to Health and Safety\u201d and \u201cStop Work Policy\u201d. The former is based on several principles including compliance with the law, adoption of the best standards, implementation and continuous improvement of the Workers\u2019 Health and Safety Management System in compliance with the international standard ISO 45001; promotion of information initiatives to spread and consolidate the culture of health, safety and organizational well-being. The latter, the \u201cStop Work Policy\u201d, provides that both employees and contractors are required to intervene promptly and stop any activity that may put their own or others\u2019 health and safety at risk. In any case, note that the final indicator requested cannot be directly communicated by Enel, as it is calculated by the investor. |\n| **2. Rate of accidents** |\n| For 2022, Total Recordable Injuries amounted to 809 (2021 figure of 1,055). For full disclosure of the types of injuries reported by Enel (for Enel people and subcontractors), please see the \u201cChapter reference\u201d column. In any case, note that the final indicator requested cannot be directly communicated by Enel, as it is calculated by the investor based on the information provided in the balance sheet. |\n| **3. Number of days lost to injuries, accidents, fatalities or illness** |\n| For 2022, the total days lost due to workplace injuries was 7,492 (of which 1,968 to Enel people and 5,524 to subcontractors). The figure does not take into account days lost to occupational diseases. In any case, note that the final indicator requested cannot be directly communicated by Enel, as it is calculated by the investor. |\n| **4. Lack of a supplier code of conduct** |\n| Our purchasing processes are based on pre-contractual and contractual conduct geared towards mutual loyalty, transparency and collaboration. The basis of our procurement processes is loyalty, transparency and collaboration, and we ask our suppliers not only to guarantee the quality standards required, but also to commit to adopting best practices in terms of human rights and of the impact of their activity on the environment. Indeed, there are clear and specific references in terms of codes of conduct, including our Policy on Human Rights, Code of Ethics, Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan, and global compliance programs. |\n| **5. Lack of grievance/complaints handling mechanism related to employee matters** |\n| In line with the third pillar of the United Nations Guiding Principles, Enel has established multiple access channels for reporting by people inside or outside the company, including: - a whistleblowing channel, available to internal and external stakeholders, accessible via: - web or toll-free number as indicated on the Enel Code of Ethics webpage; - by letter to the address: Enel S.p.A. \u2013 Audit Function \u2013 Code of Ethics. Via Dalmazia, 15 \u2013 00198 Rome, ITALY; - various processes and tools available to communities in the area of influence of our activities; - customer complaints or information channels (via email, website, toll-free number). |\n| **6. Insufficient whistleblower protection** |\n| The whistleblowing management process is regulated by the \u201cManagement of anonymous and non-anonymous whistleblowing\u201d Policy, which guarantees anonymity and protection against any form of retaliation. |\n| **7. Incidents of discrimination (no.)** |\n| In 2022, 4 violations were recorded relating to cases of discrimination at the workplace, in particular cases of harassment. |\n| **8. Excessive CEO pay ratio (%)** |\n| For 2022, the CEO pay ratio at Enel was 60% (2021 figure: 90%). In any case, note that the final indicator requested cannot be directly communicated by Enel, as it is calculated by the investor. |\n| Section | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| 9. Lack of a human rights policy | Since 2013, Enel has adopted a Policy on Human Rights, approved by the Board of Directors and updated in 2021 to take into account changes in international frameworks and our operational, organizational and management processes. The policy leverages the commitments set out in the various codes of conduct such as the Code of Ethics (adopted in 2002), the Zero Tolerance Plan for Corruption and global compliance models, by strengthening and expanding on their content. The policy sets out 12 principles, divided into two broad themes: practices in the workplace and relations with communities and society. |\n| 10. Lack of due diligence | As required by the UN Guidelines and by the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct, we have set up a process \u2013 codified in an internal procedure applicable at global level \u2013 that, with reference to the entire value chain in the various countries where we operate, aims to evaluate our procedures and operational processes and define, if necessary, an improvement plan to strengthen the systems that protect the principles set out in the Policy on Human Rights. |\n| 11. Lack of processes and measures for preventing trafficking in human beings | Since 2013, our commitment against all forms of human trafficking has been formally set out in principle 2.1.1, \u201cRejection of forced or compulsory labor and child labor\u201d of our Policy on Human Rights. |\n| 12. Operations and suppliers at significant risk of incidents of child labor | Since 2013, our commitment against all forms of slavery and child labor has been formally set out in principle 2.1.1, \u201cRejection of forced or compulsory labor and child labor\u201d of our Policy on Human Rights. We believe that children and underage workers are a risk category, which is why we pay close attention to respecting their rights throughout the value chain of our activities. We reject the use of child labor, as defined by the legislation in force in the country where the activities are carried out. In any case, our workers are never younger than the minimum age laid down in ILO Convention No. 138. Human resources management systems and procedures therefore guarantee the absence of minors in the workforce. |\n| 13. Operations and suppliers at significant risk of incidents of forced or compulsory labor | Since 2013, our commitment against the use of any kind of forced or compulsory labor has been formally set out in principle 2.1.1, \u201cRejection of forced or compulsory labor and child labor\u201d of our Policy on Human Rights. The contracts considered overall regulate labor conditions, clearly defining workers\u2019 rights (working hours, remuneration, overtime, indemnity, benefits). Each worker is guaranteed a translated employment contract in his/her native language. |\n| 14. Number of identified cases of severe human rights issues and incidents | In 2022, no serious human rights violations were recorded through the Group\u2019s whistleblowing channel. |\n| 15. Lack of anti-corruption and anti-bribery policies | In compliance with the 10th Global Compact principle, according to which \u201ccompanies are committed to combating corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery\u201d, Enel intends to pursue its commitment to fighting corruption in all its forms \u2013 whether direct or indirect \u2013 by applying the principles expressed in the pillars of its Anti-Bribery Management System. Enel\u2019s Anti-Bribery Management System (ABMS) is based on the Group\u2019s commitment to fighting corruption by applying the criteria of transparency and conduct as set out in the Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan (ZTC Plan) and confirmed in the Anti-Bribery Policy adopted in compliance with international standard ISO 37001:2016 (on anti-bribery management systems). |\n| 16. Cases of insufficient action taken to address breaches of standards of anti-corruption and anti-bribery | Ascertained violations relating to reports received through the Ethics Channel are subject to disciplinary measures and/or sanctions against the people responsible. In addition to reports relating to the Code of Ethics, no other events were reported. |\n| 17. Number of convictions and amount of fines for violation of anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws | On the basis of the reports to the Ethical Channel received in 2022, no violations led to convictions or financial penalties for the people involved. In addition to reports relating to the Code of Ethics, no other events were reported. |\nHuman Rights Content Index\n\nOur pledge to respect human rights is the guiding principle that permeates all our activities and it is fully integrated into our corporate purpose and values, since we belong to the territory, and we are an essential element in the lives of people, businesses, and society at large. With our commitment we are striving for sustainable progress, to make our company and the communities in which we operate more prosperous, more inclusive and more resilient, without leaving anyone behind.\n\n| ISSUE                        | PRINCIPLE                                                                 | DESCRIPTION

The EU Taxonomy Regulation acts as an important enabler to promote sustainable investments and accelerate the decarbonization of the European economy, while at the same time creating reliability and transparency for investors and supporting companies in planning the Net-Zero transition.\n\nWe are committed to reporting on the implementation of Article 8 of the European Taxonomy Regulation 852/2020 and of the Delegated Act which further specifies the content, methodology and presentation of information to be disclosed by both financial and non-financial companies.\n\nConcerning the Climate Delegated Act, which lays out the criteria for verifying the contribution to climate mitigation and adaptation, we welcome the different thresholds defined in the EU Taxonomy Regulation on the basis of climate and environmental sciences, such as the specific emission limit of 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh (taking the whole life cycle into consideration) to measure the substantial contribution to achieving the climate change mitigation objectives established for most power generation technologies, in that it stems from a solid process based on a robust scientific foundation.\n\nHowever, there are some activities that, although not covered under the EU Taxonomy Regulation, are critical to promoting the well-being of citizens, especially in the short and medium term, while contributing to the sustainable development of the long term.\n\nAs regards the energy industry, there are some important sustainability-related issues that the European Commission did not consider when developing the technical screening criteria, as they were outside the main scope of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. These included energy security, grid reliability and the energy transition, all of which are critical to Europe\u2019s well-being but which are appropriately addressed by other policies, funds and regulations at EU and Member State level.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation is still in a developmental stage, and a number of important Delegated Acts are still being finalized at the time of publication of this Sustainability Report. These include acts that will detail the criteria for the remaining four objectives (sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems), as well as those that will identify economic activities that do not have a significant harmful impact on environmental sustainability and those that do. Completion of the entire regulatory process should ensure that all globally recognized economic activities are considered, thereby reducing current uncertainties regarding implementation of the process itself.\n\nGoing beyond the disclosure requirements of the Taxonomy, Enel has included the Capex alignment percentage as one of the key performance indicators of the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework used to define the Company\u2019s sustainable financial instruments. With this important move forward, Enel reinforces the role of the Taxonomy as a driver to promote sustainable investment decisions and show how sustainability can be fully integrated into the financial landscape.\n\nEnel holds its annual Capital Markets Day to align its capital allocation with the EU Taxonomy set out in its Business Plan. In particular, in 2022 Enel announced a target in excess of 80% Capex alignment for the period 2023-2025 as part of its contribution to climate mitigation.\nOur implementation process\n\nBy means of a process overseen by the CEO and Top Management, involving the relevant Functions at corporate and country level, as well as all Business Lines, we initiated a process, articulated in five steps, to analyze the applicability of the EU Taxonomy Regulation throughout the entire value chain and in all countries where we operate.\n\n1. **Identification of eligible economic activities**: we have identified all activities within the Group\u2019s portfolio that have been included both in the Climate Delegated Act and the Complementary Delegated Act. The process was conducted by taking into consideration the climate change mitigation objective only, which is our most material objective among the six objectives identified in the EU Taxonomy Regulation, also due to the lack of reliable financial data in our accounting and reporting systems to carry out a comprehensive analysis of Enel\u2019s contribution to climate adaptation objective. However, climate adaptation has been analyzed from the do no significant harm perspective, while further information on Enel\u2019s climate adaptation measures can be found in the \u201cZero emission ambition\u201d chapter.\n\n2. **Analysis of substantial contribution**: eligible activities identified in the previous stage were analyzed in detail for their compliance with the specific technical screening criteria established with regard to their substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. The analysis was carried out following the criteria both in the Climate Delegated Act and Complementary Delegated Act, namely:\n   a. **Technological analysis for power generation activities**. The threshold of 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh measured on a life cycle basis was met according to the following technological approach:\n      * **coal and liquid fossil fuels**: technology excluded from the EU Taxonomy Regulation;\n      * **gas and nuclear**: during July 2022, the EU Parliament and Council have approved the EU Commission\u2019s proposal for including nuclear and gas in the EU Taxonomy, allowing investments in these energy sources to qualify as sustainable, under a set of strict criteria defined by the Commission previously. Based on the Complementary Delegated Act (CDA), our approach is the following:\n        - **gas**: the potential compliance with the threshold of 100 gCO\u2082/kWh that applies also for this technology has been analyzed in all of our gas power plants, while we have also checked the potential compliance with the alternative criteria set out in the delegated act for electricity production from gas;\n        - **nuclear**: we have analyzed the eligibility of the three different activities related to electricity production from nuclear identified in the delegated act according to our nuclear business in Spain;\n   b. **Analysis at country, region and system level for the transmission and distribution of electricity**. Compliance with the threshold was verified by carrying out life cycle assessments certified by independent third parties.\n\n3. **Assessment of the principle of Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) to other environmental objectives**\n\n4. **Verification of minimum social safeguards**\n\n5. **Calculation of financial metrics**\n\nOur position on and commitment to the European Taxonomy\nance with the following technical screening criteria was analyzed in all eight countries where Enel distributes electricity:\n\n- the Distribution System Operator (DSO) is part of the European interconnected system; or\n- non-European DSOs belong to countries with more than 67% of newly enabled generation capacity in the system is below the generation threshold value of 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh measured on a life cycle basis in accordance with electricity generation criteria, over period 2016-2020 (data made available by national authorities over a rolling five-year period prior to the preparation of the 2021 Sustainability Report); or\n- the average emission factor of the non-European DSO network is below the threshold value of 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh measured on a life cycle basis in accordance with electricity generation criteria, in the period 2017-2021.\n\nInfrastructure dedicated to creating a direct connection or expanding an existing direct connection between a substation or network and a power production plant that is more greenhouse gas intensive than 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh measured on a life cycle basis has been identified and excluded from the eligible aligned DSOs activities.\n\nc. **Product cluster level analysis for Enel X Global Retail (Business Line).** A comprehensive analysis of the portfolio was performed, classifying eligible activities into the sectors identified in the Climate Delegated Act, such as construction and real estate, transportation, or professional, scientific and technical activities.\n\nd. **Sourcing analysis for power retail activities.** Power retail activity is currently not explicitly considered in the Climate Delegated Act, hence it has not been included in the taxonomy alignment calculation. However, considering the key role that this activity plays in the energy transition towards a zero emission economy, particularly when it is developed by integrated utilities such as Enel, we have carried out an additional analysis to determine its positive impact on the overall results if this activity would be correctly represented in the Climate Delegated Act.\n\n3. **Assessment of the principle of Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) to other objectives:** an analysis of existing environmental procedures was carried out to verify compliance with the DNSH quality criteria for each type of technology (for power generation), region (for transmission and distribution) and product cluster level (for activities of the Enel X Global Retail Business Line), adapted to the specific requirements set out for each of the following environmental objectives:\n\n- **adaptation to climate change:** analysis of global procedures (including emerging and restoration procedures), assessment of physical climate risks and solutions and adaptation plans in place covering all applicable activities related to power generation, transmission and networks and Enel X Business Line;\n- **sustainable use and protection of waters and marine resources:** analysis of water-related procedures, authorizations, environmental impact assessments, national regulations and water management plans. The analysis was limited to power generation activities, as it is not applicable to other Business Lines;\n- **transition to a circular economy:** analysis of waste management plans, procurement requirements and circular economy projects and plans covering all activities applicable to the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity and to the products of the Enel X Business Line;\n- **pollution prevention and control:** analysis of global procedures and national regulations concerning all applicable activities from power generation, transmission and networks. In addition, specific pollutants were further analyzed, including electromagnetic radiation and PCBs for transmission and networks, and emissions from power generation activities for air quality;\n- **protection and restoration of biodiversity and eco-systems:** analysis of global procedures and national regulations covering all applicable activities from power generation, transmission and distribution.\n\n4. **Assessment of the minimum social safeguards:** it has been verified that the Group\u2019s human rights due diligence process covers the entire perimeter of Enel. Our commitment to respect human rights is grounded in the United Nations framework \u201cProtect, Respect and Remedy\u201d, set out in the guiding principles on business and human rights, and in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\nSince 2013, we have adopted a specific human rights policy reflecting our commitment, which was updated in 2021 to take into account the evolving international frameworks of reference and our operating, organizational and managerial processes. The content of the policy refers to internationally recognized human rights \u2013 understood, at a minimum, as those expressed in the International Bill of Human Rights and the principles concerning the fundamental rights set out in the International Labour Organization conventions underlying the Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy.\nFor our approach to human rights, phases in the due diligence process, and communication of findings and (possible) remediation plans, please see the chapter \u201cManaging human rights\u201d. The following table illustrates our approach to the minimum safeguards criteria.\n\n### Minimum safeguards criteria\n\n| Category       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Human rights   | \u2022 The main reference international standards underpinning our commitment are the United Nations \u201cProtect, Respect and Remedy\u201d framework outlined in its Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Our commitment is transparently reflected in a specific Policy on Human Rights developed and adopted as early as 2013 and refreshed in 2021.  \n  \u2022 We have committed to monitor the implementation of the policy through a specific due diligence process defined based on the UN Guidelines and by the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct. For more details refer to the section \u201cManaging human rights\u201d. |\n| Corruption     | \u2022 As reflected in our Policy on Human Rights, we reject corruption in all its forms, both direct and indirect, since we believe it is one of the factors undermining institutions and democracy, ethical values and justice, and the wellbeing and development of society.  \n  \u2022 To this end, we reiterate our commitment to fight corruption through a plan called \u201cZero Tolerance of Corruption\u201d which is one of the pillars on which our Anti-bribery Management System is grounded and in our Group Code of Ethics. |\n| Taxation       | \u2022 We have set out a tax strategy at Group level to ensure a fair, responsible and transparent taxation, with the aim of guaranteeing consistent and uniform tax management across all entities belonging to the Group. Our tax management activity is based on the concurrent objectives of:  \n  1. the correct and timely calculation and payment of due taxes, and fulfilment of the related obligations;  \n  2. the mitigation of tax risk, defined as the risk of violating tax laws, or of abusing the principles and purposes of tax regulations. For additional details, please refer to the chapter \u201cTax transparency\u201d. |\n| Fair competition | \u2022 We promote the principle of fair competition and refrain from collusive or predatory conduct and abuses of a dominant position, as reflected in our Group Code of Ethics. |\n\n5. **Calculation of financial metrics**: the corresponding financial metrics were associated with each economic activity according to the classification made in steps 1-4, collecting the relevant financial information from the Group\u2019s accounting system. In addition, some proxies have been performed for specific activities when financial information was not available in the accounting system (described in the section on the calculation of financial metrics).\n\n---\n\n(1) In the context of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (Principles 17-21), this term refers to a continuously evolving management system implemented by a company, in accordance with the sector in which it works, its operating contexts, its organizational structure, to ensure it is not involved in human rights violations. This implies \u201cidentifying, preventing, mitigating and reporting\u201d potential negative impacts deriving from the Company\u2019s business activities.\nThrough this process, Enel classified all economic activities along its value chain according to the following three categories: taxonomy eligible and aligned, taxonomy eligible but not aligned, and taxonomy not eligible.\n\n**Eligible-aligned**: this refers to an economic activity that simultaneously satisfies the following three conditions:\n- it is explicitly included in the EU Taxonomy Regulation for its substantial contribution to climate change mitigation; and\n- it meets the specific criteria developed by the EU Taxonomy Regulation for that specific environmental objective; and\n- it meets all DNSH criteria and minimum social safeguards.\n\n**Eligible-not aligned**: refers to an economic activity that:\n- is explicitly included in the EU Taxonomy Regulation for its substantial contribution to climate change mitigation or adaptation; but\n- does not meet the specific criteria developed by the EU Taxonomy Regulation for those specific environmental objectives; or\n- does not meet all the DNSH criteria and/or the minimum social safeguards.\n\n**Not eligible**: refers to an economic activity that has not been identified by the EU Taxonomy Regulation as a substantial contributor to climate change mitigation and for which no criteria have therefore been developed. The logic of the European Commission is that these activities might:\n- not have a significant impact on climate change mitigation or could be integrated into the EU Taxonomy Regulation at a later stage;\n- cause a very significant impact on climate change mitigation, so they cannot be eligible in any case.\n\nConsequently, the existence of the third category \u201cnot eligible\u201d makes it impossible to achieve a business model that is fully aligned with the criteria of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, even though these not eligible activities might not cause any harm to the EU\u2019s environmental objectives.\nIn 2022, we updated our eligibility analysis according to the process and the new definition for the three categories described above and pursuant to the final version of the Climate Delegated Act published in the Official Journal of the European Union in December 2021, while also the Complementary Delegated Act publishes in the Official Journal of the European Union in July 2022. The following three tables summarize the results of this analysis.\n\n(1) The operation of our nuclear generation portfolio is not included among the eligible activities considered by the Complementary Delegated Act in the generation of electricity from nuclear power plants.\n\n(2) Includes both fuel-oil and gas (OCGT) as it is not possible to divide the two types of fuel. Fuel-oil was considered to be the prevalent fossil fuel and is therefore not eligible under the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n| Business Line | Activity | Description of the activity (according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation) | Condition aligned with requirements |\n|--------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Electricity generation from wind power | (4.3) - Construction or operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity from wind power. | 100% of the installed capacity is eligible and aligned because:  \n\u2022 it makes a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation as no specific technical screening criteria are required;  \n\u2022 it complies overall with DNSH criteria for the following applicable objectives: adaptation, circular economy and biodiversity;  \n\u2022 it complies overall with minimum social safeguards. |\n| Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology | (4.1) - Construction or operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity using solar photovoltaic (PV) technology. | 100% of the installed capacity is eligible and aligned because:  \n\u2022 it makes a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation as no specific technical screening criteria are required;  \n\u2022 it complies overall with DNSH criteria for the following applicable objectives: adaptation, circular economy and biodiversity;  \n\u2022 it complies overall with minimum social safeguards. |\n| Electricity generation from hydropower | (4.5) - Construction or operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity from hydropower. | 99.3% of the installed capacity is eligible and aligned because:  \n\u2022 it makes a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation, since it includes all flowing water plants, all pumped storage plants, all reservoir plants with a power density above 5 W/m\u00b2 and all reservoir plants below 5 W/m\u00b2 with a life cycle greenhouse gas intensity below 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh as certified by G-RES;  \n\u2022 it complies overall with DNSH criteria for the following applicable objectives: adaptation, water and biodiversity;  \n\u2022 it complies overall with minimum social safeguards. |\n| Electricity generation from geothermal energy | (4.6) - Construction or operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity from geothermal energy. | 100% of the installed capacity is eligible and aligned because:  \n\u2022 it makes a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation, as all power plants have a life cycle GHG emission intensity of less than 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh, as verified by an independent third party;  \n\u2022 it complies overall with DNSH criteria for the following applicable objectives: adaptation, water, pollution and biodiversity;  \n\u2022 it complies overall with minimum social safeguards. |\n| Storage of electricity (batteries) | (4.10) - Construction and operation of facilities that store electricity. | 100% of the installed capacity is eligible and aligned because:  \n\u2022 it makes a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation as no specific technical screening criteria are required;  \n\u2022 it complies overall with DNSH criteria for the following applicable objectives: adaptation, circular economy, water and biodiversity;  \n\u2022 it complies overall with minimum social safeguards. |\n| Business Line | Activity | Description of the activity (according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation) | Condition aligned with requirements |\n|--------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Transmission and distribution of electricity | (4.9) - Construction and operation of transmission systems that transport the electricity on the extra high-voltage and high-voltage interconnected system.

A metric that considers only turnover is strongly influenced by the business activities with a high volume of revenues (such as the wholesale market \u2013 trading) that do not contribute proportionally to growth in the ordinary gross operating profit to the same extent as other business activities.\n\n- The financial information was gathered from the digital accounting system used by the Enel Group, or from the management systems in use by the Company\u2019s Business Lines. However, some proxies were delegated to provide a more detailed representation of the figures or to exclude specific activities from the overall calculation of eligible alignment (such as not aligned hydroelectric power generation or infrastructure considered eligible but not aligned among eligible and aligned distribution network systems). For example, the following proxies were used:\n  - hydroelectric: eligible-not aligned hydroelectric power plants were excluded by considering their output multiplied by the average turnover per unit in the years 2021 and 2022. This approach was also extended to Capex, Opex and EBITDA;\n  - distribution: new connections between a substation or grid and a power plant with a greenhouse gas intensity above the threshold of 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh were excluded considering their capacity (in MW) multiplied by the average turnover per unit (k\u20ac/MW) for the years 2021 and 2022. This approach was only applied to turnover and Capex.\n\n- Aggregate financial data in the report refer to the \u201csector\u201d level and include items related to third parties and inter sectorial exchanges.\n\n- Financial metrics were represented by considering all electricity and gas sales as \u201cnot eligible\u201d. An additional analysis has been performed in the last section of the chapter to provide a view of the results if part of this business activity would be considered aligned to the EU Taxonomy.\n\n- The figures for 2021 have been restated to integrate the following methodological changes:\n  - **Electricity generation from fossil gaseous fuels**: it has been considered as eligible-not aligned after applying the criteria set out in the Complementary Delegated Act (previously represented as not eligible).\n  - **Transmission and distribution of electricity**: it has been performed a reassessment of the eligibility status of the distribution activity in Colombia to take into account updated data from the national electricity system concerning the new renewable capacity built in the last five years, causing a change in the status from eligible-aligned to eligible not-aligned. In addition, there have been implemented minor adjustments on the criteria to identify the infrastructure dedicated to creating a direct connection or expanding an existing direct connection between a substation or network and a power production plant that is more greenhouse gas intensive than 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh measured on a life cycle basis.\n  - **Electricity retail**: it is now considered not eligible (previously represented as eligible) as it has not been explicitly mentioned in the Climate Delegated Act.\n  - **Enel X Global Retail**: cogeneration from fossil gaseous fuels (CHP), within the distributed energy solutions, is now considered eligible-not aligned after applying the criteria set out in the Complementary Delegated Act (previously considered as not eligible).\n  - **Capex**: they now cover costs that are accounted based on IFRS 16 Leases, paragraph 53, point (h), as requested by the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178.\nAbsolute turnover/Capex/Opex/EBITDA correspond to the turnover/Capex/Opex/EBITDA (measured in euros) of each specific activity. The share of individual KPIs corresponds to each individual economic activity in the total turnover/Capex/EBITDA of the Group (except for Opex, the total of which refers only to the type of costs required by the taxonomy). The share of turnover/Capex/Opex/EBITDA of each individual economic activity contributes to achieving climate change mitigation targets. This is the only objective of the EU Taxonomy Regulation alignment analysis shown in the tables due to lack of comprehensive financial information in Enel\u2019s accounting system, while the criteria for the other four environmental objectives are not yet available.\n\nStatement on the alignment of Enel\u2019s business to the EU Taxonomy Regulation\n\nOverall results\n\nThe high level of alignment of our economic activities with the EU Taxonomy Regulation in 2022, made possible by their substantial contribution to the climate change mitigation objective while respecting the principle of Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) to other environmental objective and observing the minimum social safeguards, is shown below.\n\n- 56.7% of the ordinary gross operating profit (EBITDA) in 2022 relates to business activities aligned with the EU Taxonomy Regulation, compared to 63.9% in 2021. The EBITDA percentage of taxonomy eligible and aligned businesses decreased in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to changes in revenue (see details below).\n\nEBITDA (ordinary)\n2022\n\n(2) 2021 figure has been restated based on methodological changes mentioned in the section \u201cProcess for calculating the financial metrics\u201d.\n\nOur position on and commitment to the European Taxonomy\n\u2022 21.4% of turnover in 2022 relates to business activities aligned with the EU Taxonomy Regulation, compared to 33.9% in 2021.\\(^3\\)\n\nThere is a high increase in absolute terms in turnover in the year 2022 compared to the year 2021. This increase has been experienced more in non-aligned activities such as power generation from gaseous fuels and non-eligible activities such as trading and power and gas commercialization and electricity generation from coal, mainly due to the market situation with high prices and higher thermal production. So, the turnover aligned decrease 12%.\n\nTurnover 2022\n\n- 81.9% of capital expenditure (Capex) in 2022 relates to business activities aligned with the EU Taxonomy Regulation, compared to 82.0% in 2021.\\(^3\\)\n\nThe actual 2022 Capex for eligible-aligned activities is 4.5% higher than the Capex planned for 2022 in the 2022-2024 Strategic Plan for the same activities, mainly due to higher investments in absolute terms in eligible-aligned activities than planned (more than 0.5 billion euros), and also to the adjustments made in the EU taxonomy accounting process such as the addition of the costs accounted based on IFRS 16 Leases, paragraph 53, point (h), which were not considered in the 2022-2024 Strategic Plan.\n\nCapex 2022\n\n\\(^3\\) 2021 figure has been restated based on methodological changes mentioned in the section \u201cProcess for calculating the financial metrics\u201d.\n\n(1) Also includes the increases in assets deriving from leasing operations (for 0.6 billion euros).\n66.9% of operating expenses (Opex) in 2022 relates to business activities aligned with the EU Taxonomy Regulation, compared to 60.8% in 2021.\\(^{(4)}\\)\n\nThe percentage of Opex of taxonomy eligible and aligned activities increases in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher maintenance costs incurred in renewable energy production and taxonomy-aligned distribution activities.\n\n(1) Only expenses required by the taxonomy.\n\n\\(^{(4)}\\) 2021 figure has been restated based on methodological changes mentioned in the section \u201cProcess for calculating the financial metrics\u201d.\n\nOur position on and commitment to the European Taxonomy\nOverall results with power retail activities view\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act has not explicitly included the segment referred to retail power sales (with NACE code D35.1.4), deducting that it does not provide a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. Nevertheless, retail power constitutes a fundamental segment of the power value chain. The exclusion of such activity from the definition of a sustainable power system hinders the key role of the EU market liberalization and ultimately the efforts and value of a decarbonized end use energy consumption.\n\nFurthermore, electrification, powered by renewable energy, is the most efficient and cost-effective solution to tackle climate change as it is clean, affordable, and high performing, as well as being the only path for a truly clean energy system. Nevertheless, sustainable electrification of end energy uses requires not only clean technologies in power generation, but also power retail companies to offer renewable electricity to end customers to satisfy their energy demand.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, Enel is convinced that the EU Taxonomy should explicitly consider retail power activity as an eligible activity for which alignment should rely on the same criteria available for electricity production activities. In this way, power sales to end customers would be linked to the production source, promoting retailers to sell power from sustainable sources. This fact is even more relevant in integrated utilities that, even though operate in the power production and power retail segments with different companies within the same Group, the business model is run following a comprehensive and unique view of the whole power value chain.\n\nTherefore, we present here an additional view of the overall results considering the power retail activity as eligible and determining its alignment by applying the same criteria that exist for power production. To this end, we have relied on the Guarantees of Origin instruments available in Italy and Spain, since they provide transparency to consumers about the proportion of electricity that retailers source from renewable generation, thus it meets the existing EU Taxonomy criteria referred to power production activities. Consequently, turnover from power sales was calculated considering the quantity of power sold at retail level by Group companies in Italy and Spain using Guarantees of Origin (based on data from national authorities), applying the average turnover per unit. This approach has also been adopted for Capex, Opex and ordinary gross operating profit (EBITDA). To avoid double counting, the eligible turnover per sector is net of inter-sectorial exchanges (relations between Enel Green Power, Enel Grids and Retail).\n\n| Overall results with power retail view | Unit | 2022 | 2021 |\n|---------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Ordinary gross operating margin (EBITDA) | % | 57.6 | 67.0 |\n| - Eligible-aligned | % | 19.2 | 18.5 |\n| - Not eligible | % | 23.2 | 14.5 |\n| Total | millions of euro | 19,683 | 19,210 |\n| Turnover \u201cRevenue\u201d | % | 30.2 | 40.4 |\n| - Eligible-aligned | % | 34.2 | 35.5 |\n| - Not eligible | % | 35.6 | 24.1 |\n| Total | millions of euro | 143,009 | 88,006 |\n| Capital expenses (Capex) \u201cInvestments\u201d | % | 83.0 | 82.7 |\n| - Eligible-aligned | % | 9.2 | 9.6 |\n| - Not eligible | % | 78 | 77 |\n| Total | millions of euro | 15,088 | 13,831 |\n| Operating expenses (Opex) | % | 66.9 | 61.1 |\n| - Eligible-aligned | % | 14.2 | 15.7 |\n| - Not eligible | % | 18.9 | 23.2 |\n| Total | millions of euro | 1,050 | 1,029 |\nDetailed results\n\nThe following tables are represented according to what is required by Article 8 of EU Regulation 852/2020, therefore considering the activity of electricity sales as \u201cnot eligible\u201d.\n\n### EBITDA (ordinary)\n\n| Economic activities | Taxonomy Code | Substantial contribution criteria | DNSH criteria | Category |\n|---------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|---------------|----------|\n|                      |               | Ordinary gross operating profit (EBITDA) (1) 2022 | Proportion of ordinary gross operating profit (EBITDA) (2) 2022 | Climate change mitigation (3) | Climate change adaptation (4) | Water and marine resources (4) | Circular economy (4) | Pollution (4) | Biodiversity and ecosystems (4) | Minimum safeguards (7) | Taxonomy-aligned proportion of ordinary gross operating profit (EBITDA) (2) 2022 | Taxonomy-aligned proportion of ordinary gross operating profit (EBITDA) (2) 2021 | Enabling activity | Transitional activity |\n| Electricity generation from wind power | 4.3 | 2,094 | 10.6 | 100.0 | 0.0 | n.a. | n.a. | n.a. | Y | n.a. | Y | Y | 10.6 | 73 |\n| Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology | 4.1 | 591 | 3.0 | 100.0 | 0.0 | n.a. | n.a. | n.a. | Y | n.a. | Y | n.a. | Y | 3.0 | 2.0 |\n| Electricity generation from hydropower | 4.5 | 1,178 | 6.0 | 99.4 | 0.0 | n.a. | n.a. | n.a. | Y | Y | n.a. | n.a. | Y | 6.0 | 144 |\n| Electricity generation from geothermal | 4.6 | -139 | -0.7 | 100.0 | 0.0 | n.a. | n.a. | n.a. | Y | Y | n.a. | n.a. | Y | -0.7 | 1.2 |\n| Storage of electricity | 4.10 | 0 | 0.0 | 100.0 | 0.0 | n.a. | n.a. | n.a. | Y | Y | Y | n.a. | Y | 0.0 | 0.0 |\n| Transmission and distribution of electricity | 4.9 | 7,137 | 36.3 | 92.5 | 0.0 | n.a. | n.a. | n.a. | Y | n.a. | Y | Y | Y | 36.3 | 376 |\n| Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment | 73 d | 91 | 0.5 | 100.0 | 0.0 | n.a. | n.a. | n.a. | Y | n.a. | n.a. | Y | n.a. | Y | 0.5 | 0.4 |\n| Urban and suburban transport, road passenger transport | 6.3 a | 37 | 0.2 | 100.0 | 0.0 | n.a. | n.a. | n.a. | Y | n.a. | Y | Y | n.a. | Y | 0.2 | 0.1 |\n| Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment | 73 a-e | 1 | 0.0 | 100.0 | 0.0 | n.a. | n.a. | n.a. | Y | n.a. | n.a. | Y | n.a. | Y | 0.0 | 0.0 |\n| Professional services related to energy performance of buildings | 73 a-e;

Report on the information subjected to reasonable assurance\u201d of the \u201cAuditors\u2019 responsibility section\u201d of this report (the \u201cinformation subjected to reasonable assurance\u201d).\n\nOur procedures did not cover the information set out in the \u201cOur position on and commitment to the European Taxonomy\u201d section of the NFS required by article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852.\n\nResponsibilities of the parent\u2019s directors and board of statutory auditors (\u201cCollegio Sindacale\u201d) for the NFS\n\nThe directors are responsible for the preparation of an NFS in accordance with articles 3 and 4 of the decree and the \u201cGlobal Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards\u201d issued by GRI - Global Reporting Initiative (the \u201cGRI Standards\u201d).\n\nThe directors are also responsible, within the terms established by the Italian law, for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of an NFS that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nMoreover, the directors are responsible for the identification of the content of the NFS, considering the aspects indicated in article 3.1 of the decree and the group\u2019s business and characteristics, to the extent necessary to enable an understanding of the group\u2019s business, performance, results and the impacts it generates.\n\nThe directors\u2019 responsibility also includes the design of an internal model for the management and organisation of the group\u2019s activities, as well as, with reference to the aspects identified and disclosed in the NFS, the group\u2019s policies and the identification and management of the risks generated or borne.\n\nThe Collegio Sindacale is responsible for overseeing, within the terms established by the Italian law, compliance with the decree\u2019s provisions.\n\n**Auditors\u2019 independence and quality control**\n\nWe are independent in compliance with the independence and all other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. Our company applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC Italia 1) and, accordingly, maintains a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n**Auditors\u2019 responsibility**\n\n**A. Limited assurance report on the NFS**\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion, based on the procedures performed, about the compliance of the information subjected to limited assurance with the requirements of the decree and the GRI Standards. We carried out our work in accordance with the criteria established by \u201cInternational Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (revised) - Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\u201d (\u201cISAE 3000 revised\u201d), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board applicable to limited assurance engagements. This standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the information subjected to limited assurance is free from material misstatement. A limited assurance engagement is less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement carried out in accordance with ISAE 3000 revised, and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters and events that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement.\n\nThe procedures we performed on the information subjected to limited assurance are based on our professional judgement and include inquiries, primarily of the company\u2019s personnel responsible for the preparation of the information subjected to limited assurance, documentary analyses, recalculations and other evidence gathering procedures, as appropriate.\n\nSpecifically, we performed the following:\n\n1. analysing the material aspects based on the group\u2019s business and characteristics disclosed in the information subjected to limited assurance, in order to assess the reasonableness of the identification process adopted on the basis of the provisions of article 3 of the decree and taking into account the reporting standards applied;\n\n2. analysing and assessing the identification criteria for the reporting scope, in order to check their compliance with the decree.\n\n3. comparing the financial disclosures presented in the information subjected to limited assurance with those included in the group\u2019s consolidated financial statements;\n4. gaining an understanding of the following:\n   - the group\u2019s business management and organisational model, with reference to the management of the aspects set out in article 3 of the decree;\n   - the entity\u2019s policies in connection with the aspects set out in article 3 of the decree, the achieved results and the related key performance indicators;\n   - the main risks generated or borne in connection with the aspects set out in article 3 of the decree.\nMoreover, we checked the above against the information subjected to limited assurance presented in the NFS and carried out the procedures described in point 5.a).\n\n5. understanding the processes underlying the generation, recording and management of the significant qualitative and quantitative information subjected to limited assurance disclosed in the NFS.\n   - Specifically, we held interviews and discussions with the parent\u2019s management personnel and personnel of Enedesa S.A. and Enel Cile S.A. We also performed selected procedures on documentation to gather information on the processes and procedures used to gather, combine, process and transmit non-financial data and information to the office that prepares the information subjected to limited assurance.\n   - Furthermore, with respect to the significant information subjected to limited assurance, considering the group\u2019s business and characteristics:\n     - at parent level\n       a. we held interviews and obtained supporting documentation to check the qualitative information presented in the NFS and, specifically, the business model, the policies applied and main risks for consistency with available evidence;\n       b. we carried out analytical and limited procedures to check, on a sample basis, the correct aggregation of data in the quantitative information;\n   - we visited, including remotely, Enedesa SA, Enel Chile SA and Enel Produzione S.p.A., which we have selected on the basis of their business, contribution to the key performance indicators at consolidated level and location, to meet their management and obtain documentary evidence supporting the correct application of the procedures and methods used to calculate the indicators.\n\nB. Reasonable assurance report on the selected indicators\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion, based on the procedures performed, about the compliance of the information subjected to reasonable assurance with the requirements of the Decree and the GRI Standards. We carried out our work in accordance with the criteria established by ISAE 3000 revised applicable to reasonable assurance engagements. This standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the information subjected to reasonable assurance is free from material misstatement. A reasonable assurance engagement involves performing procedures to obtain evidence supporting the data and information subjected to such engagement.

The green bonds are for institutional investors and are guaranteed by Enel SpA. The net issuance proceeds \u2013 carried out under the medium-term bond issue program of Enel and Enel Finance International (Euro Medium-Term Notes Program \u2013 EMTN) \u2013 were used to finance eligible projects according to the \u201cGreen Bond Principles\u201d categories, published by the ICMA (International Capital Market Association). In particular, the proceeds were used to finance:\n\n\u2022 new projects for the development, construction and repowering of generation plants from renewable sources (green bond emission in 2017 and 2019);\n\u2022 new projects for the development, construction, repowering and refinancing of generation plants from renewable sources as well as projects for transmission, networks and smart grids (green bond emission in 2018).\n\nIn order to facilitate the transparency and quality of the green bonds issued, the Enel Group has prepared and published specific \u201cGreen Bond Frameworks\u201d for each year of emission, whose compliance with the reference principles has been confirmed by an external advisor, Vigeo Eiris, who issued the so-called \u201csecond party opinion\u201d. Within the frameworks, the categories relating to eligible projects are aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (UN SDG), in particular Goals 7, 9, 11 and 13.\n\nThe reference documents for the three emissions are available on the Enel Group\u2019s website (https://www.enel.com/investors/investing/sustainable-finance/green-bonds).\n\nThe Enel Group is among the first companies in the world having set up a \u201cGreen Bond Committee\u201d with the aim of selecting projects and monitoring the progress of their development. The reporting document hereof, published for the sixth time in 2022, meets Enel\u2019s commitment undertaken at the time of the bond issuance to report annually on the use of proceeds, on the environmental benefits deriving from the projects financed and on further ESG metrics linked to these projects.\n\nThe indicators were determined in accordance with the \u201cGreen Bond Framework\u201d (December 2016, December 2017 and November 2018) principles and shown in the table based on the type of project and the specific year of emission of the green bonds. Furthermore, all of the plant technologies as well as Grids activities in Italy for which the proceeds of the green bonds issued in 2017, 2018 and 2019 were allocated are to be considered eligible and aligned activities according to European taxonomy (European Regulation 2020/852).\n\nIn order to improve transparency and facilitate understanding of reporting over the years, the report also provides the following information:\n\n\u2022 2017 green bond reporting with evidence of projects relating to renewable plants. Seven plants also contributed toward the allocation of the proceeds of the 2019 green bond following new investments (Capex) that were made;\n\u2022 2018 green bond reporting with evidence of projects related to:\n  \u2013 renewable plants, three of which that contribute toward the allocation of the proceeds of the 2019 green bond due to new investments (Capex) that were made;\n  \u2013 \u201crefinancing\u201d of renewable plants due to the replacement of previous credit lines;\n  \u2013 investment activities relating to the business area \u201cEnel Grids\u201d;\n\u2022 2019 green bond reporting with evidence of the projects relating to renewable plants, 10 of which were also subject to reporting for the 2017 and 2018 green bonds, as described previously.\n\n(1) SDG 7 \u201cAffordable and clean energy\u201d; SDG 9 \u201cIndustry, innovation and infrastructure\u201d; SDG 11 \u201cSustainable cities and communities\u201d; SDG 13 \u201cClimate action.\u201d\nFinally, in agreement with what is required by the cited Green Bond Framework, this document consists of the following indicated below.\n\n- **Summary table of 2017, 2018 and 2019 emissions** with indication of the installed capacity and the cumulative CO\u2082 avoided for all years of Green Bond reporting.\n\n- **Table A \u201cFinancial indicators\u201d**, which reports:\n  - the capacity and amount of the \u201cforeign currency investment\u201d approved by the Board of Directors and/or the Investment Committee, and communicated to the financial market through specific press releases;\n  - the value of the \u201cinvestment in euros\u201d, calculated by considering the average exchange rate for the years 2017-2019 (for projects defined in 2017), the average exchange rate for the years 2018-2020 (for projects defined in 2018) and/or the average exchange rate for the years 2019-2021 (for projects defined in 2019) of Enel\u2019s Industrial Plan;\n  - the share of the green bond proceeds allocated to the project as the difference between the total capitalized costs as at December 31, 2017, December 31, 2018 and/or December 31, 2019 and the amount of third-party financing associated to the specific project(2). The amounts of proceeds allocated to the projects in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively were used in the same years;\n  - the date of entry into operation corresponding to the time when the plant produced the first kWh. In this regard, it should be noted that all of the plants associated with the three green bonds have entered into operation(3).\n\n- **Table B \u201cESG indicators\u201d** which shows the environmental benefit in terms of actual CO\u2082 avoided. In particular, with reference to:\n  - renewable projects:\n    - the quantity of effective generation (with the exception of the repowering plants whose share of generation cannot be separated from the rest of the plant);\n    - the quantity of actual CO\u2082 avoided, determined by multiplying the effective generation by the emission factor linked to the specific thermoelectric energy generation of the country in which the plant is located (emission factors source: Enerdata - March 8, 2023 release);\n  - the cumulative value of effective generation and the relative CO\u2082 avoided for the entire years of Green Bond reporting;\n  - Enel Grids projects, the following indicators are also provided:\n    - the cabling ratio, determined by the ratio between the length of the cable lines and the total length of the lines. The increase in this index over time is due to an increase in the length of the overhead and underground cable line to the detriment of bare conductors; in particular, the main environmental benefits concern the containment of plant cutting activities and a drastic reduction in the risk of electrocution and collision for birds;\n    - network automation, which corresponds to the ratio between RCP (Remote Controlled Point) and medium/low-voltage equipment;\n    - technical network losses, mainly related to the characteristics/functions of the network. These losses are usually calculated using statistical models or benchmarks. A reduction in technical network losses results in a reduction in the energy to be generated and a consequent reduction in emissions and consumption of raw materials;\n    - the elimination of oil equipment with PCB reduces the risk of contamination of a compound no longer in production since the 1980s and classified as ecotoxic and bioaccumulable;\n    - energy savings is represented in terms of \u201cenergy saved\u201d in MWh in place of the CO\u2082 avoided (t) to specifically report the improvement in efficiency obtained thanks to the use of so-called \u201cin ecodesign\u201d transformers and the optimization of MV grids as the difference between losses detected before and after these interventions.\n\n- **Table C \u201cFurther ESG indicators\u201d** which shows, where possible and appropriate(4), as envisaged in the \u201csecond party opinion\u201d(5), the following indicators for the renewable projects:\n  - water consumption related to data reported for the plants in only the period following their entry into operation (from the moment there are no plants financed by the green bonds with the \u201cunder construction\u201d status);\n  - projects for protecting biodiversity promoted by Enel in connection to the operation of the plant;\n\n---\n\n(2) If the same company is involved with the implementation of several projects, proceeds are allocated to the specific project based on the capacity.\n\n(3) During 2022, the status of 19 MW of installed residual capacity that refers to the Italian hydroelectric repowering plants Isola Serafini I and II, Mucone I and II changed to \u201cin operation\u201d. In particular, there was a variation in the method of calculating the repowering capacity of Isola Serafini. In fact, the final capacity of the plant considered is limited by the power of the alternator with respect to what could have been obtained considering the maximum power of the turbine.\n\n(4) Projects relating to renewable plants with a capacity of more than 20 MW are considered to be relevant.\n\n(5) The indicator \u201cMaterial reused/recycled after revamping\u201d is not applicable, as the proceeds of the green bond were not used to finance revamping projects in 2017, 2018 and 2019.\nthe cases in which the site stopped its operations (plant shutdown) due to environmental management issues and their impact;\n- fatalities or high consequence (\"Life Changing\") injuries to Enel people;\n- activities and projects carried out to support local communities in the areas surrounding the plant. The indicator related to the number of beneficiaries of these projects refers to the people involved by such activity or project.\n\nThe above indicators in Table C, with the exception of water consumption and plant shutdown due to environmental issues, also refer to Enel Grids projects.\n\nTable D \u201cOverall information\u201d which provides the criteria, indicators, overall information and approach chosen by Enel to develop the projects financed through the proceeds of the bond.\n\nThe data have been thoroughly calculated on the basis of the results of Enel\u2019s accounting, non-accounting and other information systems, and validated by the persons responsible in each case. The data determined through the use of estimates and related calculation method has been expressly indicated.\n\n### SUMMARY TABLE OF 2017, 2018 AND 2019 EMISSIONS WITH INDICATION OF THE INSTALLED CAPACITY AND THE CO\u2082 AVOIDED\n\n| Green Bond (GB) emission | Area of investment | GB proceeds allocated (mil \u20ac) | Installed capacity (MW) | Cumulative CO\u2082 avoided (t) |\n|--------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|\n| 2017 Renewables          |                    | 1,238                         | 3,355                    | 25,875,420                |\n| 2018 Renewables          |                    | 1,240                         |                          |                          |\n| of which new renewable projects | Renewables | 575                           | 1,878                    | 10,857,053               |\n| of which new Enel Grids projects | Grids | 665                           |                          |                          |\n| 2019 Renewables          |                    | 986                           | 631                      | 2,524,576                |\n| of which new projects identified in 2019 | Renewables | 65                            | 631                      | 2,524,576                |\n| of which new Capex for 2018 projects | Renewables | 342                           | n.a.                     | -                        |\n| of which new Capex for 2017 projects | Renewables | 579                           | n.a.                     | -                        |\n\n(1) For Enel Grids projects, energy savings are represented in terms of \u201cEnergy saved\u201d (MWh) in place of the CO\u2082 avoided (t) to specifically report the improvement in efficiency obtained thanks to the use of so-called \u201cin ecodesign\u201d transformers and the optimization of MV grids as the difference between losses detected before and after these interventions.

(the \u201ccompany\u201d), which comprises the summary table of omissions, table A \u201cFinancial indicators\u201d, table B \u201cESG indicators\u201d, table C \u201cFurther ESG indicators\u201d, table D \u201cOverall information\u201d and notes thereto and has been prepared on the basis of the Enel Group\u2019s green bond framework (the \u201cframework\u201d).

Our company applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC 1) and, accordingly, maintains a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nAuditors\u2019 responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion, based on the procedures performed, about the compliance of the report with the frameworks described in the \u201cIntroduction and reporting criteria\u201d note to the report. We carried out our work in accordance with the criteria established by \u201cInternational Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (revised) - Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\u201d (\u201cISAE 3000 revised\u201d), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board applicable to limited assurance engagements. This standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the report is free from material misstatement. A limited assurance engagement is less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement carried out in accordance with ISAE 3000 revised, and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters and events that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement.\n\nThe procedures we performed on the report are based on our professional judgement and include inquiries, primarily of the parent\u2019s personnel responsible for the preparation of the information presented in the report, documental analyses, recalculations and other evidence gathering procedures, as appropriate.\n\nSpecifically, we performed the following procedures:\n\n1. obtaining and reading the second party opinion;\n2. interviewing relevant staff at corporate and business level responsible for the 2022 Green Bond management and reporting;\n3. understanding the processes underlying the generation, recording and management of the qualitative and quantitative information disclosed in the report;\n4. holding interviews and discussions with the company\u2019s management personnel to obtain information on the processes and procedures used to gather, combine, process and transmit data and information to the office that prepares the report;\n5. performing sample-based documental analysis and analytical procedures to check the indicators included in the report.\n\nConclusion\n\nBased on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 2022 Green Bond Report of Enel S.p.A. has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the frameworks described in the \u201cIntroduction and reporting criteria\u201d note to the report.\n\nOther matters\n\nOther auditors performed a limited assurance engagement on the 2017, 2018 and 2019 figures presented in the 2022 Green Bond Report and expressed their unqualified conclusions on 10 May 2019, 7 May 2019 and 8 April 2020, respectively.\n\nRome, 6 April 2023\n\nKPMG S.p.A.\n\n(signed on the original)\n\nMarco Maffei\nDirector of Audit\nSTATEMENT\n\nDNV Business Assurance (DNV) has been commissioned by the management of ENEL SpA to carry out an independent verification of its Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions relative to the 2022 calendar year.\n\nENEL SpA has sole responsibility for preparation of the data and external report.

Enel\u2019s KPI performance\n\na. KPI #1: Scope 1 GHG emissions Intensity relating to Power Generation (gCO\u2082eq/kWh)\n\n| KPI #1: Scope 1 GHG emissions Intensity relating to Power Generation (gCO\u2082eq/kWh) |\n|---|\n| Group Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) intensity (gCO\u2082eq/kWh) |\n| **Definition/Methodology:** Group Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions (including CO\u2082, CH\u2084 and N\u2082O) deriving from the generation of energy and measured in grams of CO\u2082eq per kWh, as defined and detailed in the documentation for sustainability-linked transactions and in line with the GHG Protocol[7]. |\n| **Rationale:** the KPI measures Enel\u2019s performance with respect to the decarbonization strategy of its energy generation mix, which will be fully reached by 2040, while mitigating at the same time the direct emissions from its most relevant Scope 1 source, which represents more than 99% of total Scope 1 emissions. |\n| **Materiality:** in 2022, KPI #1 Scope 1 GHG emissions Intensity relating to Power Generation represents 39.2% of Enel\u2019s total carbon footprint and is equivalent to 52.1 MtCO\u2082eq. |\n| **Intermediate and long-term goals:** since 2015 Enel has defined a series of goals for reducing the direct greenhouse gas emissions deriving from its energy generation activities, increasing the level of ambition in every update made to align it with the most ambitious climatic scenario available. Also in 2015, Enel defined its first science-based target aligned with the scenario \u201cwell below 2 degrees\u201d, targeted toward reducing the carbon intensity by 25% as compared to 2007 (reaching 350 gCO\u2082eq/kWh). In 2019, Enel, having reached the 2020 goal a year in advance, announced a new science-based objective for 2030 aligned with the \u201cwell below 2 degrees\u201d scenario, increasing the percentage of emissions reduction from 70% to 80% as compared to 2017 (from 125 gCO\u2082eq/kWh to 82 gCO\u2082eq/kWh), how aligned with the 1.5 \u00b0C scenario. In 2021, Enel announced to have brought forward the achievement of the objective of complete decarbonization by 10 years, from 2050 to 2040. This goal was certified by SBTi in 2022 together with the update to the 2030 goal, which decreased from 82 gCO\u2082eq/kWh to 72 gCO\u2082eq/kWh, which also increased the level of ambition in this case. Since 2020, Enel has also defined annual short-term goals to make its pathway toward full decarbonization more visible. These goals were set in different updates of the Strategic Plan and have the following thresholds: 148 gCO\u2082eq/kWh at 2023, 140 gCO\u2082eq/kWh at 2024 and 130 gCO\u2082eq/kWh at 2025. |\n| **Contribution to the EU environmental goal:** Climate Change Mitigation. |\n| **Contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals:** SDG 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. |\n\nEnel\u2019s KPI #1 and relative SPT performance\n\n|  | 2020 (actual) | 2021 (actual) | 2022 (actual) | 2023 (target) | 2024 (target) | 2025 (target) | 2030 (target) | 2040 (target) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| KPI #1 Performance | 214 | 225 | 229 | 148 | 140 | 130 | 72 | 0 |\n| Gap vs 2023 | 66 | 77 | 81 | | | | | |\n| Gap vs 2024 | 74 | 85 | 89 | 8 | | | | |\n| Gap vs 2025 | 84 | 95 | 99 | 18 | 10 | | | |\n| Gap vs 2030 | 132 | 143 | 147 | 76 | 68 | 58 | | |\n| Gap vs 2040 | 214 | 225 | 229 | 148 | 140 | 130 | 72 | |\n\n[6] In the previous versions of Enel\u2019s Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework and in the documentation for the financial instruments issued in compliance with these versions, KPI #1 \u201cScope 1 GHG emissions Intensity relating to Power Generation (gCO\u2082eq/kWh)\u201d was defined as \u201cDirect Greenhouse Gas Emissions Amount (Scope 1)\u201d.\n\n[7] The GHG Protocol provides the greenhouse gas accounting standards (https://ghgprotocol.org/).\nb. KPI #2: Scope 1 and 3 GHG emissions Intensity relating to Integrated Power (gCO\u2082eq/kWh)\n\nGroup\u2019s combined greenhouse gas emissions, Scope 1 (including CO\u2082, CH\u2084 and N\u2082O) deriving from power generation and Scope 3 deriving from the generation of electricity purchased and sold to end customers, measured in grams of CO\u2082eq per kWh.\n\n- **Definition/Methodology**: Intensity metric calculated as the combination of Group Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions (including CO\u2082, CH\u2084 and N\u2082O) (measured in gCO\u2082eq) and Group Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions from the generation of purchased electricity that is sold to end customers (measured in gCO\u2082eq) (which represents an element of subcategory \u201c3-Fuels and activities connected to power\u201d of the \u201cGHG Protocol-Scope 3 standard\u201d), divided into power generation (measured in kWh) and purchased electricity (measured in kWh). The methodology is defined and detailed in the documentation for pertinent sustainability-linked transactions and in line with the GHG Protocol.\n\n- **Rationale**: KPI #2 covers all electricity sold by Enel to its end customers, obtained both from Enel\u2019s own generation and from electricity purchased from third parties.\n\n- **Materiality**: in 2022, KPI #2 Scope 1 and 3 GHG emissions Intensity relating to Integrated Power represented 60.6% of Enel\u2019s total carbon footprint, equivalent to 80.6 MtCO\u2082eq, of which Group Scope 1 CO\u2082eq emissions from power generation represented 39.2%, equivalent to 52.1 MtCO\u2082eq and Group Scope 3 CO\u2082 emissions from the generation of electricity purchased and sold to end customers represented 21.4%, equivalent to 28.5 MtCO\u2082eq.\n\n- **Intermediate and long-term goals**: in November 2022 Enel announced its goal of reducing the emissions of the above KPI to 135 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2025.
