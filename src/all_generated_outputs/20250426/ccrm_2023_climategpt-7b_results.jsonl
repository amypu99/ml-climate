The total amount of feed used by the Company is estimated at 74.4 million metric tons. The calculation of emissions from soy and corn is based on data provided by the Embrapa Institute and the National Supply Company (Conab) and takes into account the average productivity of Brazilian soil (2.67 tons of soybean and 2.72 tons of corn per hectare and year). The average emissions per ton of soy and corn are 0.128 and 0.114 kgCO\u2082e, respectively, calculated based on the average national emission factor for direct land-use change (OLU) and emissions from the energy used in production.
